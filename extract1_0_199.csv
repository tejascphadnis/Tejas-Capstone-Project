review_473949210,“Obviously not as big as Florida but that's not necessarily a bad thing”,"There was more than enough to keep our family of four occupied for the day. We went early morning midweek and it's wasn't too busy. Roller coasters were good for afults and older children and plenty to keep the younger ones amused.Slightly confusing to get too as we had taken the cable car over to Sentosa. If you're using this option, you then need to get another cable car and the monorail to the park but not difficult to do and good fun.

review_473775052,“I might be spoiled”,"I visited Universal Studios Singapore on a Monday, hoping there would not be much of a crowd. Instead, I discovered that everywhere in the park was very busy. I was only able to ride 3 rides in a 7 hour period, because I had to wait an average of an hour plus for the rides I did ride. I feel spoiled, because I am used to Universal Studios Orlando, which is a bigger park. The Singapore version felt like it was half the size and therefore, a little bit disappointing.

review_473753477,“Full of fun and adventure”,"Best thing to do when you visit to Singapore. Enjoyed the goose bumps slides like HUMAN, CYLON and MUMMY rides. Best among all was the TRANSFORMER ride, it was one of kind experience. Also light camera & action ride is good to get interim of cinematography. Sad part was long ques and waiting time for each ride suggest to go for express pass to enjoy all the rides in time. keep watch on show timings do not miss the water show it was thrilling to watch entire action in front of your eyes. lot of dining options yet very limited choices for vegetarian.

review_473735656,“good look but scary rides”,"when we entered the studios we first went to Madagascar. It was exciting we have to board a boat and you will go inside a broken part of a ship inside there will be the robotic characters and then you will be out of the ship. then we went to a roller coaster when it climbs the track it will be slow but when it will go down it will be superfast it was a short ride. this studio is mostly made for kids and teenagers but be careful that some rides are a little scary.

review_473724108,“You don't need an express pass!”,"I seriously think that you don't need an express pass if you don't mind waiting for 45 min~ I love the concept where the whole themepark are filled with fans, water station, keep you hydrated and chill although the weather is really hot! Must try: human vs cylon, transformer, lights camera actions.. The fireworks on every Saturday not really impressive but worth staying till late night if you don't mind~

review_473613041,“Full of fun and adventure”,"Have visited here twice. And I must say each time I was so impressed.Some tricks you may wanna consider before going:Go on weekdays. Weekends are hell crowded and the queue time is about 120 min for each ride especially in the morning. You can simply buy the express pass, still facing lines but shorter.Be there at 10 AM to get the most out of it.Plan your day ahead, prioritize the rides you want to do the most as you will have short of time. My suggestions are Transformers, roller coaster (Cylon and Human), Revenge of the Mummy, Jurassic Park Rapids adventure. You can simply forget about Madagascar and Shrek 4D if you do not have enough time. But if you looking for something a bit relaxing, go for them.There are several shows during the day, not all are good but worth watching if you have time.The queues will be shorter in the evening. We got the chance to ride Cylon 3 times and Revenge of the Mummy 2. Food is of ver low quality and pricey! (I am not sure if eating will be a good idea at all before riding the high-speed rides!) Anyhow, that is the only thing you get to eat there. You can take some chocolate or granola bars or try some ice cream there (Ben & Jerry`s at Far Far Away) and then later eat dinner in Sentosa. (Chillis restaurant and some local food nearby). All the rides will be closed at 7 PM.Enjoy and have lots of fun.

review_473583315,“Mostly for kids”,"We went with a group of friends 20-30s and had a good time with them but the park is definitely more for children. There are a couple extreme rides like Human, but with relatively long waits (40 min and it was a slowish hot day). Transformers was my favorite with 3D glasses and special effects but makes many people feel sick.

review_473518349,“A fun small park with poor maintanence”,"My partner and I have visited many other Universal Studios parks around the world and wanted to give this one a go while on our honeymoon. The park itself is surprisingly small and most of the themed lands merge in to one another. The ride selection was okay for a thrill seeker, but might be less so for young families. Most of the rides during our visit were open with the odd ride down for renovations which is completely understandable. One thing that was really noticeable though, especially when comparing the park to its US equivalents was that the park was poorly maintained. Most of the rides paint jobs were flaky and the theming and props looked like they had been through a hurricane. I really wasn't expecting this from such a new park and for me, it really showed the low level of commitment to maintain elements when comparing it to a Disney theme park.Would I come here again? Probably not. But if you're not really fussed about how a park is kept, and want a small handful of thrilling rides, go for it.

review_473393726,“Must visit”,"Hell lot to walk.Gear up comfortably. Carry abundant snacks with you. A must pack is the selfie stick.It can rain any moment in Singapore, do not forget to carry an umbrella or raincoat. In case of rain, all the attractions are temporarily withdrawn for the safety of the visitors. So please do have the time margin in mind. Do not pack your schedule.Arrive by 10.00 am to experience the most of it. Universal is best to be visited on a weekday to avoid the rush. Even on a weekday, buy an express pass. Depending on your group, you can plan your visit. More time spent on kids activities if with kids. Must visits: Battlestar Galactica Human & Cylon Accelerator Transformers Jurassic park rapids adventure (wet ride) Live water show (water world)Madagascar, Shrek & Puss in the boots are very well planned. Even for an adult it is a relaxing experience.Live shows keep happening at various times. Plan as you please.After each ride, you exit at a store. Do not forget to pick goodies.The major rides need you to place your stuff in lockers. In case you are more of an adventure person, can select multiple entry pass.

review_473333699,“Sentosa universal Singapore ”,"This was a nicely done park for its themes. Maybe I'm getting a bit older and have seen it and done it before. The roller coasters looked pretty insane but didn't go on because I felt a bit unwell. Food was the usual theme park food: terrible fast food and soft drinks or water. Shops were so highly priced I didn't bother to buy anything-usual theme park though. I didn't feel it was anything that amazing, just another theme park! I've heard queues are bad on the weekend, I went during the week and they weren't bad. Like 10mins waiting for transformers ride.

review_473312555,“Underwhelming but express pass is a must”,"I have been to Disneyland Paris and now Universal Studios Singapore and must say it pales in comparison to Disneyland Paris. Not much to do if you are with young kids but it is not a bad place by any means.Couple of things - Get lots of water as I had heard you get water but not once did I find a spot. We bought a long sipper due to which we could get an liquid refilled at no charge as long as we had that sipper. Also, get a hat and raincoat since the weather is fickle. Also please get an express pass as it will save loads of time and enable you to do most rides. Since we had planned to go to the SEA aquarium, we left at 3 pm from there otherwise we would have done all rides. You also have the option of re entry on the same day as they stamp you before you leave. You also get baby prams on rent for SGD 15 which is a bit steep but it serves the purpose.The gift shop at the start is also quite decent, not as many options as Disney but you can get lot of stuff nevertheless. You can buy and they give you the option of picking it from a drop off point so use that option to avoid carrying luggage.Now for the park - it is shaped like a big circle. You can start from the left which is Madagascar and take the water ride as well as get yourself clicked with the cast of Madagascar and do the merry go round if you have a child (this is something which was easier to do as compared with Disney). Then you go to Far Far Away or the land of Shrek where you can do the Shrek 4D ride and the Puss in Boots Adventure Ride. While the Shrek 4D takes almsot an hour, it is not as impressive so avoid if you are short on time. Do the Puss in Boots ride though as it is different and quite good.Then move to Jurassic park for the roundabouts, the water adventure and the roller coaster - all of which are good. After that you go to the land of Pharaohs, Egypt which has a roller coaster and an adventure ride.The to the transformer section where you can do the really scary roller coaster and the Transformers 7D ride which is basically the best ride in the park. This is a must. Avoid getting clicked by the photographers who charge a bomb for their photos but if you must then there is a parade at 3 pm which is in the Sesame street section which is after the transformers section and there you can get yourself clicked and later on printed as well. The Sesame Street portion has diners and is covered with a skylight so you can relax there.A suggestion here is that get the map via google, explore all rides on youtube and then see which ones you want to do and do them first when you get there This will save time alongwith the Express pass which reduces waiting time by 30 mins. Beware though that some rides are not covered under express pass so waiting is a must for them.Have fun but if you have been to Disneyland Paris then dont expect it to be at the same level.

review_473248702,“A fun family day”,"Our family (kids 3, 9, 11) spent most of the day at universal. We made sure we were there pretty much as it opened. The crowds built up as the day went on but ok early December it wasn't too busy. It was hot but not uncomfortably so. There were some line ups. The longest was probably 20 minutes so ok. Food, as you expect, wasn't cheap but ok.The kids all had a great day. By about 4pm we had done enough though.We took​ a stroller for the three year old and were very thankful that we did. Lots of walking for little legs.We had a few shots of rain so were glad of our rain ponchos.We had to do a bit of splitting up to keep all ages happy.Older kids loved the Shrek roller coaster best.

review_473047972,“GOOD family fun!”,"Our young family enjoyed the studios a lot. It's such an easy trip from the city ($12 cab) Here are a few tips. Midweek crowds are much more manageable. Try to avoid the weekend crush. The express pass is a MUST with young kids. Even on a moderately busy day, the queues were from 30mins to 1.5hrs for the Transformers ride (which was excellent). The pass is not cheap, but it allows you to bypass the queues almost entirely. In the hot weather, this makes a huge difference to the day's enjoyment. We managed to go on all the rides we wanted (12 of them) and left with smiles. The pass is cheaper off-peak (early in morning, or after lunch) and can be bought in many places around the park. Bring spare clothes for little ones (some rides are wet, and there is a small water fountain play area). You can fill up water bottles around the place. The locker system is an annoyance for some of the larger roller coasters. You have to check your bags before you ride. On busy days there is a locker queue. It's free for 2.5 hours so it might be an idea to check your bags and do the two largest rollercoasters first (Sci Fi world and Mummy World).

review_473020314,“Universal was a good day out”,"The highlight for me and my family was the Sesame Street Breakfast. This was definitely 5*!To enter Universal before it officially opens was an amazing feeling. We then went to breakfast where Cookie Monster led my youngest child to the buffet. The breakfast experience was amazing. The sesame street characters took their time with all groups and their staff assisted in taking photos for us. An amazing experience.After breakfast, Universal officially opened so we started to explore. My children's favourite ride was the Elmo one. Universal was fine but I expected more. I've been to Disneyland a few times and felt that Disneyland was run much better than this Universal. They could do so much more. It was a good day out but I wouldn't rush back to Universal Singapore

review_472896886,“Interesting disorganized and an over crowded adventure park”,"The park has interesting themes and exciting rides but the surging crowds was a put off. We spent about five hours here and could do just three events that lasted a total time of about 30 Mins.The rest was spent on standing in a queue awaiting our turn and searching for items of interest and eating in a restaurant. The Jurassic park theme was pretty good but the ride lasted just 6 minutes after a wait period of about 50 plus minutes. Madagascar also was good but fortunately the wait period was shorter. The question of whether the visit is worth the price is difficult to answer. All the themes are good. There are some that interests kids and some for teens and others for adults. Re- organizing the park with detailed information on the various themes and some brief summary of what can be seen or experienced plus a map of the park with directions and sign boards etc. and instructions would go a long way to help visitors to manage their time in the best possible manner inside the park, If these are already available they are obviously not available to every one. I was searching for the official website of Universal Studios for such information but could not find one. I could get only information provided by third party tour operators for this attraction.Paying extra for an express ticket to jump the queue was an option I was not very keen on. One jumps the queue encroaching the time from the standard ticket holder's time there by raising his/her time in the queue.An absorbing subject for a debate in ethics.

review_472382233,“Worth the experience”,"Spent the day at Universal and was put off straight away once we entered and went to go on the first ride, the guy at the entrance indicated that unsecured items should be put into lockers that were provided (which is fair enough), however every locker we went to store our goods were sold out, we then had to find someone that represented the park to give us direction (good luck with that), we eventually found two gents who were more than happy to help, they suggested to go back out and use the lockers situated just outside of the entrance, we found the lockers, then had trouble with inserting cash (again no one around to assist), eventually had success on the last go, with all this we had missed an hour and a half, not to mention lining up at the que to get in again, by the way it costs 15 dollars for a small locker outside of the park opposed to 20 dollars max inside of the park. After the initial frustrating moments we went on the first ride (battle star Galactica) which took nearly 2 hours to get through, I did put this down to the lack of organisation when we eventually reached the ride, there was way too much delay in getting people off and on (the rest of the rides were super organised), I understand the safety component, however this was due, in my opinion, poor team work (besides the ride was average). after this ride we went nearly all the major rides (I think a few people have mentioned after lunch), which did not take over 30 minutes to get on (transformers 15 mins after lunch), and found the organisation between these teams excellent. We have been to Universal in LA,Knotsberry Farm in Anaheim, Movie world and Dreamword, in Queensland, although you can not compare these to Singapore (which is overall expensive), although comparing prices for entry and food, fairly much the same across the board. As we were first timers here, I would suggest cater for the whole day here and don't forget to get your tickets from the MRT for 4 dollars each return, this is situated on the third floor of the Vivo centre. Best attraction for us was Transformers.

review_471913693,“Fun fun fun”,"Anyone who loves excitement, thrill, adventure in life must visit this place. Except for one roaller coaster twisting took all rides. It was mind blowing. My 9 yr son enjoyed it to the core. With good eatery joints inside you need not worry about carrying food items. A clean and well maintained place. One thing to definitely not miss would be Steven Spielberg Lights Camera Action section where they show you a glimpse of sound and special effects. All the other rides are good. Though the rates are on a little higher side but worth it. Please reach the venue on time so that you can cover the entire thing in a day.

review_471781373,“Fun for all Ages”,"My first Universal Studios Experience and it was a blast for any movie buff. Clean and helpful staff with great sets that will amaze you. Some tips for a great day:1. Start early when its less crowded.2. Buy a priority pass (SD$30.00) but it believe me its the difference between 5 mins and sometimes 50mis in a queue. This is a must during school holidays or weekends.3. Not much dining options mostly fried food. But you can get pass-outs to eat in Sentosa and then go back inside.4. Do the Jurrasic Ride as one of your last ones because you can get pretty wet (especially your shoes)5. Wear comfortable shoes.6. Do the Water World show , Check the times that its on and dont miss out.7. People will try to cut the line, just be assertive and polite in addressing this and if they succeed in forcing their way, don't let it ruin your day (but you shouldn't get this problem if you get a priority pass).

review_471772202,“Not worth the money!!!!”,"Very expensive attraction. Beverages and souvenir very expensive. Very boring rides. Very very very long queue. This theme park is more concern about making a snake like queues. Never ending qieues. Long queues will make all the guest felt tired and also felt like giving up of coming to the USS AGAIN. Queue for nearly 1 bour while the rides only last for as long as 2 min. So dissappointing and miserable theme park ever.USS management should limit the number of guest coming to USS to avoid dissappointment among the guests. USS management also should not just think of making money for their own interest without thinking of the guests feeling. This will be my first and last trip to USS. Those guest who read this might want to think twice before coming here.

review_471662183,"“Great technology, but not for a thriller seeker”","First, I should be honest that the technology and design in this amusement park is really great. But so sorry, the attraction is more appropriate for kids. They only have battlestar galactica and mummy revenge for thriller seeker, I even can said both is not really scary.. you will see a lot of children (about 7 years old) go to this ride, it means that it is not too scary for kids. Another good attraction is transformer, but that's awesome because of the technology, good but not scary at all.. another attraction is just like a kid's toys or modern doll house. Nice, but not for a thriller seeker. You also should be patient in facing unfriendly staff. Most of them is really annoying, their expression shows if they are too tired and always tell everything in a hurry. Not recommended for thriller seeker, but recommended for family and adult who loves relaxing attraction.. hope they will build another serious thrilling attraction for adult and teach their staff to be more friendly.

Almost the same with US LA.We went there on Wednesday, and the crowd is still a lot.We able to complete most of the rides on time.The Roller Coaster is a long queue, but worth it.The Shrek4D waiting time is a bit too long.The Mummy ride is awesome. We love it.The best is still the Waterworld Show. A must go show. Don't miss this.The actors and actresses are so awesome and funny. 5 stars performance.Rocketfella is a bit boring.Sesame Street show is quite ok.Food is just normal.We used a SGD5 meal voucher that came with the tickets that we bought online.

We were able to get around all the rides we wanted (my partner and I, no kids) and have a leisure couple of leisurely meals. The rides were great, loved the battle star galactica ones and the I loved the transformers 3D thing, that was a real surprise.

The Water World show is a must to go see, get there early for splash zone seats. All the rides were awesome, lines not too big and maximum we waited was around 30 minutes, especially late afternoon it was very quiet. Lots of food choices in Universal or can go out to Sentosa to eat then come back in. I would definitely return when visiting Singapore again!

review_471413775,“Great Day Out”,"Spent a day at the park.Went on a Friday which was relatively quiet as we walked on most rides with a maximum 5 minute wait time.We purchased a ticket which included hotel pick up and transfer to the park, cost £86.00 for the two of us. Return vis the MRT Train system costing £3.50 for us both. That was to Orchard Road City Centre (Holiday Inn) . See separate review for that. If you made your own way to the park on the underground system the park entrance is only £33 each plus of course the £1.75 each train fare.This is a very small park in comparison to the USA, but still worth the entrance fee.Really easy to navigate round the park, you can go left or right on entry and the park is roughly in a circle.On average two rides per area and there are 6 areas to exploreThere are 4 thrill rides, one water rapid ride ( you will get wet, even soaked) The rest of the rides I would describe as family friendly.Other than the rides must do's are Shrek 4D Adventure and Waterworld Live stunt show ( a must see )Plenty of eateries, including ice cream stands catering for all tastes and dietary requirements. Cost of eating and drinking quite reasonable even though you are a captive audience. Note you can't bring your own food and drink in, your bag is searched on entry.All in all had a great day, spent about six hours here only stopping for a half hour lunch

This universal studio is the right place to keep them occupied. Need at least a whole day to have some fun here otherwise you will be missing out on heaps of things. Please make sure you buy your tickets through the taxi driver its cheaper than buying through the agent. I am a big fan of roller coaster and they have some awesome 1s too. The live show at the water world is great if you are into loud noise gun fires canon balls and water splashes...food and drink is quite expensive inside.

They have 5 really good rides, 3 of them roller coasters, one is the Transformers 3D ride and one a water rapid. They have lots of other roller coasters, shows and rides but they are more for kids or people who like calmer rides. The queues can be quite long, and in case of thunderstorm they will close most of their rides and this not being an unusual happening in Singapore be prepared to take a break in the afternoon. If you don't like queuing I recommend buying an express pass for just 30 dollars.The best thing about this place is that it is not just a theme park, the decoration and atmosphere is magical! Don't expect though too many rides, but look forward to a really wonderful experience.

review_470634617,“Beats any theme park available in Australia ”,"As someone who spent formative years (and some adult ones) living in the US I am very hard to please when it comes to theme parks. On this occasion I was bringing my 10yo who has no memory of visiting a decent theme park (including her first birthday spent at Disneyland in Anaheim). I know this is one of the smaller Universal parks so I was focussed on having my daughter just enjoy whatever was on offer given she really had nothing to compare it to. However I found this park to be better than my expectations and it definitely delivered for my 10yo who went from being terrified of roller coasters to a hardcore lover of them in only one day at Universal Studios Singapore. Favourites were definitely Revenge of the Mummy, Transformers and Battlestar Galactica (both sides) - and the Rapids ride in Jurassic Park was a great way to warm up to the more thrilling stuff and to cool off in the tropical heat simultaneously. Great atmosphere, fairly decent food and good staff made for a very memorable day for us. Would definitely visit again.

Can't open umbrella and you cannot move to your seat once show started. It's a entertainment were have actors perform a story. Have lots of rides to try too. You should save energy before go here in Universal to make sure you can try all. They open at 10AM and close I think till around 1900. Better you eat first before go here coz food inside is kinda more expensive. Place is actullay not so huge but if have many people you need to spend more time waiting in the line.

review_468868549,“Theme Park with Awesome Rides”,"Been here quite a few times with family and friends. The rides are fantastic. Do plan to go during weekdays and non peak seasons as the queue for rides might takes up to 1 hour. Its a must ride for me for Transformer ride, mummy roller coaster, rapid adventure boat ride, flying canopy, puss in boots mini rollercoaster. Its a must watch for the waterworld show and Sherk 4D show. The rest of the attraction can take it if you have the time. I will always go for the shortest waiting time first as the queuing time will change sometimes will be shorter half hour later. But usually after 6pm, most of the attraction will have lesser people queuing as most of them went home already.

Foods are quite expensive so I advice you to bring your own water, small bag, handkerchief & an extra shirt. Going there is easy because there's a free train from Vivo city to USS. There are free locker rentals for the extreme rides which covers usually around 30-40mins, just in time when you finish the ride. The ""must-ride"" there are The Mummy, Transformers, & Battlestar Galactica. There's a map that will be given to you & make sure that you ride everything so you enjoy what you paid for. Rides vary from extreme rides to shows for children.

There are a lot of restaurants inside and outside food is not allowed but there is not much food options for vegetarians/ Indians. But we still got some veg Indian food from a cafe/ restaurant in the mummy world and you could get ice cream, brownies, fries and stuff to eat as well.It will take you a whole day to see it completely and still you will feel like you missed many things, so be on time to enter.

review_467988657,"“Exciting place, but not for oldie”","I've been there twice. The first time was with my friend back to 2014. We went there on weekend and faced long queues for every ride. The second time was with my family last Oct. We was there on weekday, so the line is much shorter. The whole park was still great as usual. The best ride must be Transformer, we tried twice!!! The problem is that my parents were not really into these exciting rides. After two rides, they gave up and just walked around looking and eating instead. So, advice for those with oldie: - should not bring them there unless they are ready for thrilling games. - Food and drink could be expensive there, so it's better if you prepare some in advance. There're taps in every game, so just bring the empty bottle and you can take the water in the tap.- Be there on weekday to avoid the long queue- Bring hat and put on sunscreen to avoid the heat.

review_467701551,“Small but worthwhile ”,"You don't need multiple days as this is a very small park. In one day we were able to do everything twice. It's great for young children or as a first theme park experience. For older kids wanting a lot of fast roller coasters, it might be disappointing. Our five year old could do almost everything. Our three year old could do enough. We visited midweek and there were very short lines, normally 5 or 10 minutes if we couldn't walk right on. The longest we waited was 30 minutes for Transformers. We considered the fast passes but I'm so glad we didn't pay the extra money. No need. Crowds were very manageable. Much of the park is covered so you aren't in the hot sun too much. I had never seen that at another theme park. It was great!Expect your typical overpriced theme park food and souvenirs. They say no outside food or drinks but this didn't seem to be enforced. If I had to do it again I might bring my own snacks.

review_467456632,“Well Planned Route Helped!”,"Went there during CNY (I know!) I thought I was setting myself (and my husband) up for disaster but it turned out better than I expected! We did exactly what was recommended online. Go to the popular rides first, eat lunch early (at 12noon) and take note the show time so that we won't miss anything. We ended up riding all the popular rides more than once, some thrice! (No Express Pass required) We had lots of extra time taking pictures and even try some of the children rides (:D). However, I would like to add a few things. It is great to wear shorts with zippers so that you can keep some of your paper money with you when going for rides especially those don't allow you to bring anything with ya and asked you to lock it in the locker. The queue wasn't taking too long just we were lost track of the time and then we were stranded because we over the 40mins free period (we were there 42mins mark - serious!) and need to pay 2$ before can collect our stuff. Our wallets were inside the locker. Luckily I manage to borrow some from a kind couple that just walked in to put their stuff inside the locker. Or better still load your EzLink card with some money on it and just carry it around inside your zipper pocket :D No coins because the staffs will buzz you out from the queue. We brought our own raincoat, one that provides good protection but thin. Because what they sell inside the themepark really do nothing for you. We even get to enjoy the Water World Show right at the wet area without being (soaking) wet! Don't go for Cylon and Human first if you are there early in the morning right when the themepark open. Why? Because that early, they are not running at full capacity. So eventho the lines aren't long but it will take double the time to clear. That's what happened to us..so after the Human ride, we went to another one then came back for Cylon when it is running at full capacity. We had a great time!

review_467447783,“The most fun we had in Singapore!”,"I think Universal Studios was the part of our trip that all of us were looking forward to the most. We visited the park on October 10, 2016.We booked our tickets online on the Sentosa site and received a discount + a free water bottle (with the head of the Indominus-Rex from Jurassic World). I would recommend the online reservation because you won't have to spend a ton buying water bottles within the park, and the refills are not as expensive as filling up once.We entered the park around at 10 am, and Beetlejuice was standing near the entrance. We went on the Jurassic Park River Rapids ride first, and then went on The Mummy. The later's queue was around 45 minutes the first time we rode it, but we didn't get bored. There is music and sound effects along the way, and plenty to look at.We had lunch at the Discovery Center in Jurassic Park - wet noodles with vegetables. Four of us shared three plates as the quantity is pretty big and it's a little expensive. So this is a good option for vegans. The ambiance in the place was of course great.I emailed the company before-hand about options and they also suggested the Oasis Space Cafe. Their Indian option with chana masala, rice and papadums is vegan. Being Indian, we didn't want to have Indian food even on vacation (: Via email, they also said they could customize a pizza without cheese or dairy products. So make sure to contact them in advance if you have any special dietary needs.After lunch, we made our way towards the junction where Jurassic Park, Water World and Far Far Away meet, and got to see the raptor show. Took a bunch of pictures and successfully answered that Bubbles was a velociraptor (yay dinosaur-loving me!) We rode The Mummy again around at 3 pm and the wait time was only 10 minutes (yay!) We also walked around and discovered other places like the Canopy Flyer. If you walk a little further inside, you will see nice picture areas with a T-Rex fossil head and broken dinosaur eggs that you can sit in.Unfortunately we couldn't meet any of the Sesame Street characters. When we got to the designated area, they were leaving to take a break, and when we came back they still hadn't returned.Before leaving, we rode Madagascar A Crate Adventure, King Julien's Beach Party-Go-Round, Spaghetti Space Chase, Accelerator, Lights, Camera, Action, and Shrek 4-D Adventure.Our favorites were definitely Jurassic Park Rapids, The Mummy and Canopy Flyer.The park is small and the day we went, the crowd wasn't too big. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Everyone who worked there was always smiling. Would definitely visit again, thanks for the memories and the experience Universal Studios!

It is not well sign posted and we had no idea how far it was from the transport. There is a lot on this Island and Universal appears tucked away in a corner. Once there it is a great place, first of all we received the Seniors Discount (it doesn't matter which country you are from - if you are over 60 you can get in at the Seniors Rate - just let them know when buying your ticket).

But, that did not limit us from having all the fun! There are loads of things to do at Universal Studios for everyone. My Son (5 year old) had lots of fun at the Puss in Boots, Far Far Away from Shrek series, Madagascar themed ride, Transformers, etc. We had a great time riding on Battle Star Galactica! It's a great experience. Don't miss that. If you can go there on a weekday around 11, you can pretty much cover everything without buying an add-on express ticket. But if you are not so lucky, then better to buy an express ticket! This allows you to skip the queue for lost of the rides! Don't miss the Ancient Egypt and the Lost World attractions. If you are not too fussy about drinking water, try to carry an empty bottle so you can fill it up at various water stations inside! Food is expensive inside the studio, but you can always have god at the Malaysian Food court just outside Universal Studio. If you are lucky and it doesn't rain, you will have lots of fun!

Food stalls are found everywhere, you cannot go hungry with tons of them around you. If you're travelling with kids it's better to prepare strollers with you.

review_466380828,“Bucketloads of fun”,"Came here to celebrate my son's 4th birthday. We had a great time. Despite him having a flu, he had plenty of fun in uss. My boy is a real animal cartoon fan, so the madagascar rides were his personal favourites. Luckily he's seen the shrek movie before we came here too. He loved the shrek dungeon cinema thingy too. Although the queue was long and the briefing took a while, it was all worth it. The water effects from the donkey sneeze & other scenes was a major talking point for him all the way back to the hotel. So we knew that the short movie screening was memorable and enjoyable for him. We, the parents could not go for the sci fi rollercoaster rides becoz it was just the 3 of us and my toddler was ineligible for then. One of us had to take care of the child, so it would be less enjoyable to experience it alone. The people we saw who took them seems to have had a really good time. Who knows, maybe we'll be back again when he's grown up to enjoy the rides we couldn't take this time around. Plenty of retail shops and eateries in here too. A great many options from the themed shops all the way to the main one at the entrance. Goods and merchandise cane with plenty of variety and it would be a challenge for anyone coming out of those shops empty handed what with the great many varieties you guys have on offer. Another thing to mention is the appearances by characters which are lively and well scheduled out thruout the day. We had bucketloads of fun with the penguins and other madagascar characters. Special mention to the big guy who hosted the madagascar dance thingy. He is lively & friendly. Thank you to the whole uss team, i feel that you guys set the benchmark for a well organised theme park within our region which other similar parks can try match or gauge their own standards.

review_466064224,“Small but great park”,"If you are in Singapore then Universal is certainly worth a visit. I purchased a six month pass as I was working in the area for a while, so I visited a couple of times. The attraction is very well themed and usually the queue's are only small, it's probably not worth paying for fastrack during the weekdays. The best rides in my opinion are the Terminator-don't miss this out it really is fantastic. The Mummy Returns, again another good ride in the dark and finally Battlestar Galactica. Take suncream as it's easy to get burnt whilst walking around. Food options are good-I can recommend the Turkey Legs and also the pumpkin sandwich from the Jurassic Park area.

One of the places that we have enjoyed the most was the visit to the Universal Studios. Indeed, the place was very inviting. This amusement place made me bring myself to my childhood. The venue was not just for children to enjoy but also for the adults to make memories with family and friends.In reference to cleanliness and orderliness, its truly amazing that you can never see litter around. The staff/ employees were very accommodating and friendly. The service was excellent. I feel like going back again to Singapore and bring my kids with me to feel how lucky they are as children and how fortunate they are to enjoy life as it is.Universal Studios Singapore does not only offer quality services, they provide memories to cherish and pride to uphold.

There were various activities available for any age group, but the Waterworld show is not to miss. My friends and I also enjoyed Transformers: The Ride.

review_465500386,“Disappointed ”,"I must say I had high expectations for this amusement park and I was very disappointed. If you are going with smaller children perhaps it is more fun. But we were four adults (our children are 18 and 20). There are maybe 5 or 6 rides that were exciting, but the rest is quite lame. I also found the park to be very small. We have near my home (in Germany) an amusement park that is probably 3 to 4 times bigger, with 11 roller-coaster, plus several other attractions. Being this in Singapore and for that price I don't think it was worth the money. In our opinion the good rides were, gallactica, transformers the ride, the mummy, jurassic park rapids and the Shrek 4D movie is OK but we have seen better ones.

review_465205411,“Fun day out!”,"After being to Universal LA, this isn't as good but was well worth the visit!The day we went there were not too many people. Best to go when it opens and go to the most popular rides first. You can buy an express pass that lets you go to the front of the queue on most rides once. We purchased this but didn't use it until later in the day when more people were at the park and the wait times were 45 minutes plus - wired a treat because you actually do skip the queue to the front. Food as expected was delicious but overpriced, drinks the same. We were going to get public transport there but found it easier to get a taxi. Going home we rode in the cable car over the water from Sentosa. Great day out for everyone!

review_465187778,“Great day out”,"Universal Studios is a great day out and brings out the inner kid in us all. The rides are good and there are a good amount of options for those who don't like things like roller coasters. The best ride was probably the Jurassic Park rapids ride, however you do get wet! We didn't mind at all as it was such a hot day that some splashes were nice, however sitting around in wet shoes all day is not nice. Make sure that you take shoes that it doesn't matter if they get wet as they will easily dry! We purchased the front of line pass - and although we didn't go on a number of rides (all the roller coasters) it was still worth the purchase. Some of the rides had wait times of 45-75 minutes, yet with the front of line pass you go right to the front and get through immediately. It is very hot at Universal Studios so try to choose a cooler day to go.

review_464895968,“Fun Day Out”,"Universal Studios Singapore is a great place to spend the day, whether young or old. Getting to the park is relatively easy, by taking either the Sentosa Express or cable cars to Sentosa, which are close to MRT network.If visiting as a couple with the other half not too interested in the 'big' rides, this saves you a lot of time, particularly as the 'big' rides (the rollercoasters, basically) allow single riders. This saves a lot of time, particularly as during peak times these rides have waiting times varying for between the 45 and 90 minutes. I would recommend going on the 'big' rides in the first hour or two of opening, as you will be disappointed otherwise. You can buy a pass which allows you express entry onto these rides, but this costs about $60 extra, so can result in an expensive day out.Even a few of the family friendly rides are worth a go, even if you don't have kids with you (Puss in Boots and Sesame Street). We queued over an hour for the Madagascar ride, and to be fair, this is pretty average and wouldn't recommend doing so.

Also, we love the freebies that came with it.We went on a weekend which explains the long queue but we got to see the parade which is a plus!Not advisable for hot summer days given Singapore's humid weather.The staff at the gate was rude. We went out to exchange our $$ at the money exchange right outside the gate and we were stamped with ""invisible"" mark for returning in.When we got back after exchanging currencies, she would not let us in. I do not know if that was trickery of some sort to have less people at the park. We asked her what was the ""invisible"" stamp for if she would not have a way to trace if we were really returning or just trying to sneak. I used to think of theme parks as happy places in Earth. Bad memory of a theme park which ruined how I view places as such.

Fans were plenty along queue lines. Opportunities for snacks and water were plenty. Rides were good even for scaredy cats like me. If one was looking for wilder/higher rides, this park may not be it.Please ensure that sun protection advice are followed as it can get very hot esp between 10am til 5pm.

review_464429484,“Good park”,"We spent in the studio whole day and tried almost every single attraction, staff was very friendly and smiling whole day.We would recommend to not miss Mummy area, of course sci-fi attractions and despite the fact we are not fans of transformers, 3D drive there was simply the best.Unfortunately (big BUT), you can buy express pass which allows you to go to the special queue and you skip the line. At some attractions there were so many people with this pass that even they made queue and waiting time for normal people was incredibly long. We absolutely not agree with this mechanism and in our opinion it is not way which park should go. It is only making people mad and angry.Another point is that in Jurassic park you need to pay for locker (longer you use it, more money you pay), and together with many people with express pass you are just paying more for locker because they are skipping the queue (you wait more, pay more).If you would like to eat something, we definitely recommend Mel's bistro - great atmosphere with nice double burger.

But the rides in the park are exciting, Mummy Ride and Galactic are the best rides. I personally liked the Transformers Ride and the Shrek Show.

We bought the express pass which works on majority of the rides at the park and I have to say it paid for itself 5 times over. We skipped numerous ques which had waiting times of over 90 minutes... our longest wait was about 5. It was a lifesaver in the heat as well as a lot of the line areas aren't air conditioned and it was extremely hot. The food was extremely overpriced, which you expect so it's fine, but it was also really terrible... I don't know if we just chose the wrong places to eat but we didn't like anything. Getting there is super easy, it's just a tram ride over and you can buy you ticket to the park when you buy for the tram so you don't have to wait in line twice.

review_463604782,“Fun-filled USS Day in Surprising Singapore”,"I have been to Universal Studio Singapore numerous times (having owned their annual pass and season pass before), but I never tire of it.If one enjoys adrenalin inducing roller coaster rides, then Battlestar Galactica is a must. The Cylon (inverted / suspended blue track) is more exciting as it ends with a 360 degree loop and has a spiral. The first time I sat on it, I was thrilled to look upwards to clear blue sky, whilst experiencing G force. But this time, the wait was 50 mins so we checked out the traditional Human (red track) instead. Surprisingly, the wait was only 5 mins, after an afternoon rain. In the morning, it was a 55 min wait. So we happily sat on Human twice. Although 'tamer', Human is nevertheless still exhilarating.We also recommend Revenge of the Mummy which we also went on twice (5 min wait only), and simply could not get enough of this wild ride in the dark.Canopy Flyer was great too, with a 15 min wait only.My overseas guest was thoroughly impressed with Transfomers which is great for all ages, and not to be missed (well worth the 40 min wait). It was down in the morning, but thankfully was fixed in the afternoon.Lights, Camera, Action is always exciting to watch, for the incredible special effects of a Category 5 hurricane about to hit New York.I also never tire of watching Shrek 4-D Adventure.The new Sesame Street show ""When I Grow Up"" at Pantages Hollywood Theater is really for toddlers and young kids only. Many adults left half way.Due to inclement weather, Water World (I always enjoy watching the stunt folks at work) was cancelled.This place is highly recommended for both overseas visitors and locals alike.Families, friends and couples will certainly enjoy a great day.The fun atmosphere and enjoyable theme park ambience provides a lovely respite from our stressful lifestyle.TIPS: You can now avail of their lockers for free (upto 45 mins), so glasses, handphones and bags can be safely stored before your rides.They have water coolers outside their restrooms. You may even bring an empty bottle to refill water.Try to eat before or after the peak lunch time period.Their burgers and pizza make an affordable and quick tasty re-fueling for the day.Or you can get your re-entry stamp on your hand, and eat outside (at Resort World Sentosa with more F&B options) instead.First thing when you enter, dash off to the more popular rides such as Battlestar Galactica and Transformer first. We note that the queing time tends to get longer, as the day progresses.Bring your umbrella or raincoat as it can rain any time.You really need 1 full day to enjoy this theme park completely.When buying tickets on-line or at their counters, check if they have any promotional entry price or special package. There is usually some credit card promotion going on.

review_462890583,“Great birthday treat”,"Loved our recent trip to USS. Came with family and friends to celebrate my 40th. Went on a Monday to avoid the weekend crowds. Was still busy, about 25-40 min wait for rides but got on some rides after no wait at all. Did not buy the express ticket and still went on every ride except Battlestar. Loved Transformers, Lost Rapids (Jurassic Park), Mummy and the Waterworld show. Tip: go on the rides when the Waterworld show is on, went on Lost Rapids twice with no wait. Not as big as Disneyland but still a great park.

review_462866625,“Best Ever”,"It's was an amazing day for me in Singapore. The best and recommend things to do in there. Ticket seem not to be value for me as am not addicted of the plays, however, it's a lot of activities and fun there to discover. I recommend going with a friend or a group of friends as you can enjoy all activities together. The park is quiet big but it's very clean and convenience with the place to eat or sit. It's everyday clouded here, so advance ticket purchase online is the best way to skip the long line at the park entrance.Best Ever, especially The Transformer.

review_462802331,“Quality Universal Experience”,"The Universal Studio's theme park in Singapore is a quality theme park with a mix of favorite attractions from the U.S. parks and new attractions for Singapore. The park is small so you transit from neighborhood to neighborhood fairly quickly. The backdrops, sets, and street dressing are done well (but due to the smaller size can look a bit odd when you can see the next neighborhood right in the background of the current one).We went on a weekday (hours 10 am to 6 pm I believe). The entry process was fairly smooth and there wasn't much of a rush at 10:15 when we go to the gate. There are many options for purchasing tickets (try to do it on-line and print before you go if for no other reason to just make the process smoother). We had to find a kiosk selling tickets at the park and the signage was less than helpful (it was unclear where they were selling which tickets). Inside the park it was pretty easy (and almost no wait) to get on the rides or attractions for the first few hours. After 1 pm things started to get crowded. I can only image what a weekend may look like (especially Saturday which is the only day they have the character parade and evening fireworks). Food options in the park are pretty standard (fancy themed names for things, pretty bland, average food at pretty special or high prices).The different show timings were not well advertised (only at the spot of the show itself) and in their program it was unclear which shows would be street performances and which were inside proper facilities. The park also lacks a few rest areas (benches, cooling stations, etc.) that would make the experience more pleasant.Overall a pretty good experience and we had fun until our little one decided with the heat and jet lag they she had had enough and it was time to go home.

I'm a fan of theme parks, and although USS is one of the smaller amusement parks I've been to, there's something here for everyone. Lots of great rides and attractions. Food isn't spectacular though, and it's kind of expensive. Best rides are still Transformers and Battlestar Galactica. Waterworld is also a great show to catch! The parade was just good though. It's definitely good for day usage. I would recommend the fast pass if you can afford it, as you will cut down on the longer lines, but if you can wait 30-45 minutes for the bigger rides, it'll be fine. Great stuff!

Some were 5 minute queues and some were more than an hour long.Everything that is sold within the vicinity is quite pricey typical of Universal Studios.They have water fountains in various areas usually near the toilet where you can grab a drink or refill your bottle. Also, there is a hawker area just outside the park which is considerably more affordable with a selection of options for a nice meal.

review_462400479,“Great day but expect to wait for popular rides”,"Went on Friday - try and avoid weekend. Opens at 10:00. Excellent mix of rides and shows for little ones to the big kids! We waited 60 minutes in line for the raft ride, and some were up to 90 minutes long so keep water with you! Good thing is that most waiting areas are undercover. If you don't mind splitting your group up, opt for the 'single rider' lane, much faster. Transformers ride was excellent!! Good food options and not too expensive as they tend to be in theme parks, happy hour drinks at KTs at 4:00 - Fantastic Mojitos!! Note that many rides do not allow bags/hats/sun glasses and you will need to hire a locker for $4/hour - if your wait time goes over the hour you have to pay again to have it unlocked. Tip - if you want to have the sky gondola ride back to Vivo city at end of day, buy the combined pass with Universal ticket and save $25 per adult.

review_462370815,“Beware”,"Entered the Battlestar Galactica roller-coaster ride. The sign said 5 minute queue. We waited in a tiny queue for 90 minutes for a 30 second ride. It was hot, there were no fans going although they were there and there was no air conditioning. Only about 4 people every 10 minutes were allowed on the ride. When I finally got to the top I found out that there was a small number of teens going around and around in the express lane and they were blocking the ride for everyone else.

So much fun, I signed up for season pass :).. Here are my tips on how to enjoy the park:- buying an unlimited express pass is totally worth it! No need to q and u can sit as many times u want on a ride.- Bring your own poncho/raincoat for the Jurassic park water rides, buying one inside USS cost $4 each- Be sure to plan to watch the shows, such as water world and Sesame Street, timings are printed on the brochure- Food is average and quite expensive, u could go to the Malaysia food street located beside USS entry for lunch/dinner instead- Bring a water bottle, there are water coolers scattered all over the park, 1 bottle of water cost like $4-5, do keep hydrated cuz it's super hot and humid in tropical Singapore- Beware of crowds of tourist from China trying to cut the queues and pushing their way to the front. :(

We went on a Tuesday and though a lot of the rides got longer and longer lines as the day went on, we got on most of them within 10 minutes- the only one was Battlestar Galactica, which took 30 minutes, even early in the day. We liked Waterworld (it's good no matter where you go!) and the Lights, Camera, Action, and Far Far Away Land (Shrek) was fun. If you like theme parks, you'll still like this, though I can't imagine doing it for more than a day.

Our favourite ride was The Mummy! The architecture and decorations around the park were very impressive, it looked almost as if we were really in the movies. You will definitely need almost a whole day here if you want to see and do everything. Queueing times for rides were not too bad when we visited, usually not having to wait any more than 20 minutes per ride. The exception to this was the very popular Jurassic Park river ride, for which we waited about 1.5 hours in the afternoon, so maybe try and get to this one early in the day.There were a variety of food outlets and shops around the park.It was very easy to get to the park via the monorail to Sentosa Island.

The theme park itself felt a little smaller than other theme parks we had visited, including Universal in Orlando but the place is very well laid out.The queues were a little long and we did take the fast pass options, some of the rides were great the Battlestar Galactica, Jurassic Park and Mummy rides were particularly fun. We didn't eat a meal at the park as we thought it was a little pricey. Overall this is a good place to visit but with restricted park size it doesn't quite live up to the Orlando sister parks.

review_460327548,“superb is the word....must visit for families”,"superb is the word....must visit for families. lots of good rides and you enjoy in each of the ride. Most popular is Transformers ride in Universal studio. When you buy ticket they encourage you to buy combo tkt which includes Sentosa island as well however they have not upgraded sentosa for more than a decade so that's a boring place. Only Universal studio is good to visit.

review_460309384,“Good attractions bad service”,"Spent a day here and whilst the attractions are food the customer service is very poor. Everyone working here seems very young. My partner had a water damaged phone caused by one of the attractions and no one was interested on trying to help. 2 rides broke down on our day and after lining up for 40 mins when we decided to leave asked if we could have a fast pass when the attraction opens again we were told ""people were there longer then you"". Very dissapointing.

review_460271871,“Thrill seeking fun”,"Hubby and I don't do big rides, he also doesn't care much for heights. I'm saying this because while we are both, let's face it, whimps but we still had a great time. It is worth getting a fast pass when you buy a ticket. We went mid week and the lines were still hours long. Some more simple rides and attractions had quick lines. The Jurassic rapids were so much fun (which is possibly why the line was over an hour long) the high flyer was also great and had no line.There was plenty of food available inside so don't feel the need to bring a lunch. Also, pack light, the more things you bring with you the more time you'll spend in the lines for the lockers at the start of rides. We had breakfast at a pancake place near the entrance before we went in, and spent a total of about 6 hours inside. Which was enough time to cover everything we wanted to do. Had we have wanted to do the big thrilling rides we would have been short on time. Those lines were over an hour each. I will 100% be coming back here. It was a great day out.

Sesame street on New York area, Transformer ( there is a roller coaster, I try it and it the best roller coaster I ever try),, mummy (roller coaster in the dark), jurassic park ( rafting), and many things you can do there.

review_460234535,“Small but fun”,"The park itself is quite small but it was fun. We had free tickets to get in which was good as it is normally quite expensive. We purchased a one off express pass for S$50 each which gave us one express entry per ride. It was well worth it as some of the rides had wait times of 40+ mins which to be fair isn't unreasonable for a theme park. But with it being so hot and with a young child it was better to jump to the front. The park is very clean. It was very crowed with tourists (to be expected).

review_460224299,“Go there on Saturday for Hollywood Parade”,"from Sleepy kiwi we traveled by bus to Vivo City and train to USS at 8am. Please note on Vivo city there is a shuttle on bus area going to USS for a flat fare SGD1. did not see it that's why I have take the train and take the escalator up to 3rd floor. We arrived early. We eat at Slappy pancakes since it will open at 10am, going in is fast and organized. There isnt a lot of people so we are not rushing in to go in line. in fact the longest waiting time we had is 20 mins which is the Transformer ride. HIGHLY recommended to ride. No need for express pass though there is still few people purchase it. it was a really hot day so we didnt bother to going in and out to buy some food outside to save some money. The food we purchased range SGD10-15 for a regular burger meal. Milkshake is SGD7, ice cream SGD4. for souvenir I find it too pricey when converting since I came from Manila on ROE is 1PHP=35SGD just imagine it. The Hollywood parade start at 3pm very great show. I must also commend BETTY BOOP mascot is very nice.. Taking pictures with mascot are everywhere you must only ques. There will be rides that you will get, just in case you dont have raincoat or anything, there is drying Capsule for SGD5. since we almost go around USS two times we were too tired to wait for the fireworks :(, we go home at 6PM and queing on train takes time like 30 mins.

review_460040015,“Great place with even greater queues..”,"Visited the theme park with my wife and two kids aged 8 and 12. Purchased the standard tickets for about USD 40 pp. Really enjoyed the rides especially the duelling ""battle star galactica"" ride, which is not for the faint hearted and the Egyptian section which featured an indoor ride with all sorts of Egyptian monsters to keep us company. The 3D ""Transformers"" ride was also truly enjoyable. The kids also fully enjoyed the 3D movie at Never Never Land. My main grouse however was the very long waiting time for each and every ride. We were only able to complete 5-6 rides during the whole day and each ride had a waiting time of 1 hour or more. So I strongly recommend new visitors especially those with families and/or have just one day to visit, to pay extra and buy the fast track tickets. Else you are in for a long wait and risk get your blood pressure up (as I did) by fuming silently at those with fast track tickets sauntering in while you are in the queue for hours...

review_459984592,“Everything hurts!!!”,"But in a good way. After 7 hours and a total of 10km covered over the course of the day; the kids saw, did and ate everything and they had a blast doing it.The park needs a full day and don't be cheap, buy the express passes otherwise you will spend the entire day waiting in line.Cylon, Transformers and the Shrek 4D were great brilliant fun. The Jurassic Park ride was not a favourite. You simply got soaked for the sake of it. It was as if the inventors ran out of ideas and figured getting people wet was a sufficient substitute for a lack of imagination. It is an expensive day out the entire family thoroughly enjoyed themselves.

The taxi from Woodlands to USS was about $24, but well worth it considering all the different buses and trains we would have had to take, and would have been almost $20 for 2 people. We visited during the tail-end of Chinese New Years, but was pleasantly surprised at the short wait times. On a few rides we too the single riders lane and got put on the same ride anyways. The Mummy Returns was fantastic, we did Transformers twice, and the Jurassic Park waterride soaked us :)Will be returning with my wife, and look forward to the next trip!

From the Kingdom Far Far Away for the little kids to Sci Fi section for adults (who are kids at heart), everyone can enjoy something here. You would need at least one full day to fully appreciate everything. The food is more expensive than outside, which is natural in a theme park. It was interesting how different restaurants had a menu that catered to the theme. If you are South Asian and looking for rice, Ancient Egypt is your best bet.Make sure you pick up a map from the entrance, and travel in an anti-clockwise manner. Remember to bring a lot of water, and prepare to walk A LOT.It would save you plenty of time if you purchase the express tickets. Yes, they are more expensive than the regular ones.

review_458595591,“Great attractions for all!”,"As an adrenaline junkie like myself, the 2 things that I will never forget and will try again when I go back are:1. The Mummy - I did not expect this one to be very thrilling! I thought it would just be a boring ride. But jeezus I was blown away! It's like riding a roller coaster in total darkness! Unbelievably fun!2. Battlestar Galactica - This is the resident roller coaster of Universal Studios Singapore. It's a roller coaster with double the fun! This coaster has 2 rides. The concept is on the name itself, Battlestar Galactica. Basically it's like a fight with humans and aliens. One coaster is where you ride as the humans. A basic roller coaster ride. But the other one for me is way more fun: the aliens' side! On this other coaster, your feet are hanging! Imagine that! OMG my soul separated from my body during the first drop! I can't overstate enough how fun that ride was!But my most useful tip is this: buy express passes! Again, BUY EXPRESS PASSES!!! It's the purchase that I never regretted! It will save you a TON of time! Normal tickets will cost you AN HOUR in line waiting for your turn. But when you use express pass, it will literally take you a minute to get to the ride. There's a different line for normal tickets and for express passes. You can see the envy from the eyes of the people who endured long lines waiting. While you just walked in but you get to ride first.

review_458359781,“Fun day out ”,"My husband and I spent the day here. Now I must mention my husband is an adrenaline junkie , whilst I would say I'm the opposite . Thus I felt that the theme park catered to the both of us. Getting here is fairly easy and everything is sign posted . We took the monorail which was fast but packed . I would recommend getting here early and possibly purchasing the fast track tickets for the additional cost . As the queues were very long when we went and for example the transformers ride we waited almost two hours to get in. It was also a very hot and humid day .The studios I mentioned catered to all ages I feel. I've not been to the Florida theme park so can only base my opinion on Singapore . But they have shows , roller coasters , boat rider , souvenir shops and quite a few food outlets on site . There are different themed sections, such as the mummy, Jurassic park , shrek, transformers etc and all have there different rides and shows taking place .There are times where you may need to use the lockers as certain rides require no personal belongings. Our personal favourite ride was the water boat ride at Jurassic park. You do get slightly wet but honestly it was a breath of fresh air as we went on a very hot and humid day (humidity was at 98%). Shrek 4D was also good fun and my husband enjoyed this with the chairs moving and splashes of water on the face . The water world show was excellent and the stunts and actors had the audience fully engaged . Staff I found to be lovely honestly , they were so helpful and the service was very good. There were a couple times when some of the rides were delayed or experiencing technical problems but apart from that it is a great fun day out for all ages . And the theme park closes at 7pm .

review_458277581,“#1 in Singapore! Here are a few tips!”,"I was in Singapore on a family trip of 6 people. My parents and aunt are all above 60 while one of my cousins (24) doesn't like rides. That left me with just two of us who wanted to go to USS but I wasn't sure it justified taking all of them together and that too for an entry ticket priced at $75 each! However, it turned out to be the best day we spent in Singapore. One, it offers rides and entertainment for people of all the ages. My parents sat in ALL the rides! (I was surprised). Here are the highlights:1. The best ever stage show that I had ever seen (WATERWORLD).2. Best 4D show/ride ever. (TRANSFORMERS)3. Lights, Camera and Action.4. Great rides for adventure freaks.Here are some tips for all:TIP 1: try to visit it on a weekday. Although the queues that we found were on an average only 20%-30% occupied (of the capacity), we still ended up waiting for up to 30 minutes in a few rides.TIP 2: it is arranged in a circular layout. As soon as you enter it, look for where the crowd seems to be heading. Start walking in the opposite direction! ;)TIP 3: Single passengers have a separate queue. If you don't have a condition to sit together on a ride, it will save at least 70% of your time.TIP 4: Buy your tickets through an agent in Singapore. I got my tickets at a discount of $20 per person.TIP 5: This was the only attraction I found which gives discounted tickets for the elderly (60+) irrespective of their nationality. Tickets for my parents costed me $36 each.TIP 5: Food is very expensive inside. If you don't wanna spend that much, try getting something with you. (Before entering USS you will also find a few joints like McDonald's).

We started off early and we were there before the gates opened at 10 am but even then we greeted by a huge queue when we reached there. I read a lot of reviews before we went there to prioritize the rides , but so did everyone else !!! So we spent 2 hours in the queue for a 4 min ride which was supposed to be the star attraction - Transformers. Then we decided to do our own thing which worked out better because we were able to cover the next shows of waterworld and some of the kids rides which my 6 year old daughter absolutely loved .... Sesame Street, Madagascar, Shrek 4D. By evening a lot of the crowd had dwindled and its a good thing that the timings are now extended because we were able to cover almost everything that we wanted to.

review_457330034,“Nice place for family”,"Universal studios in Singapore is a theme park on Sentosa island. Take online ticket. One can reach there by MRT then by shuttle or Sentosa express or by walk. Less frequency of Sentosa Express makes it inefficient. So better take a walk or shuttle bus from Vivo city. Most of the rides in Universal studio are suitable for family and are mild, except Revenge of the Mummy and Battlestar Galactica gray track. Don't miss transformer 3D battle. Single rider entry saves queue time. Overall Universal studios is a fun day for a family with young children.

review_457313211,“Best in Singapore”,"This is the must visit place in Singapore.The Place is an amusement park,Like Disneyland..It has more then 3 roller coasters,& nice restaurants to dine.You need a complete day to spend time here.Universal studios is at Sentosa Island.If you go by Sentosa Express Train, then its the first station from singapore.Its a dream land for kids,,and if you are in singapore, then you should not miss it.Credit Card is accepted everywhere inside the Universal Studios.Avoid going in Rainy Day because most of the rides are closed on rainy day.Also Avoid weekends, to avoid long Ques in rides.

review_457222278,“Not great for small kids and very expensive.”,"Many of the rides had height and age limits and prevented our younger children from access. We visited on a normal weekday in the late afternoon and the rides had anticipated wait times in excess of an hour. With the few hours we had planned to stay we would be lucky if we got to ride 3 attractions. It appears that this is normal as the queues were designed to hold hundreds of people with in queue entertainment. The rides we did experience were very well done and the park was very clean. It was extremely hot on the day of our visit and some of the queues were very uncomfortable even with the fans. We got very poor value for our money and they should offer half day tickets and much cheaper prices for young kids.

review_457138669,"“Not that good. Few rides, long lines.”","Universal Studio in singapore is nothing as compared to that in the US and it is super crowded and noisy. Long lines (you can get a express pass to avoid them for 50$) and 50% of the rides only for kids.Only 3 - 4 good rides are there transformer and Galactica.we regretted spending one full day out of the 6 total days we had in Singapore. Better things to were Jurong, Sky deck ride , Area around Marina Sands bay, Clark quay, exploring super awesome food , Night show at gardens by the bay, sea world.

review_457103414,“Enjoyed even on a rainy day”,"On a rainy day in October, we decided to go to Universal Studios Singapore. We still managed to have an enjoyable day for the most part, as Universal Studios did a pretty good job trying to keep rides running when possible during rain breaks or light rain. Also, many of the rides are also indoors (like Transformers and the Mummy) so you can still do things even in the rain. The one bonus of the rain was that some rides had shorter breaks than usual (especially after they would stop and re-start after rain storms). Although good weather would have made it more enjoyable, we were glad to still have a fun day even with all the rain.

review_457089979,“Queueing is the way of life ”,"Straight to the point- weekends are crazy rush. Some staff have told me that Wed or Thu is a bit better but the pain of queueing will remain.- if you are a tourist I would advise to buy an express ticket else you will repent to having paid the ticket price and yet not experiencing half the rides.- don't miss the waterworld show. Also don't bother to go and queue early. It's a large seating space and you will get a good seat.- pick up the event timing sheets. Some shows are worth to visit.- hidden gem is the Guinness record of maximum lights inside an enclosed space within the Hollywood area. Check the picture attached. - No food allowed inside. Don't carry any else you will have to unnecessarily rent a locker to store your stuff

review_457009640,“Its all about the timing”,"We arrived at 10am and left at 8.30pm, so that says something!I suggest arriving around 930am so as to be one of the first in and plan the things you want to tick off first as by 11am+ the lines might start backing up. There is surprisingly a lot to do. At first glance you think it might be small, but it is quite large and the space is very well utilised. Lots of different themes and the kids will love it. There is also enough for the parents. Food was not the best (at least in the American diner we went to) and it is really overpriced. Suggest you head out of the park walk 2 mins into other parts of Resorts World to have a better dining experience. Make sure to get a stamp on the way out to save the grief re-entering the park. We found that come 5pm or so the park clears out and all of a sudden it takes all of 5 mins to get on a ride. I spent the next couple of hours taking advantage of checking out all the rides as many times as I could.Bottom line - Great day out and well worth the visit.

review_456914226,“Awesome experience”,"We ultimately ended up buying annual pass to USS. The rides are awesome and thrilling. Best rides are cylone, transformer, galactica and mummy. Usually the queue is long and might take time to take ride on any given weekend. But the trick is to keep thrilling rides until late afternoon when the crowd starts to thin down and disperse. Till then enjoy regular shows, madagascar, shrek, jurassic park.

They pick you up at 8:30am when the park doesn't open till 10am as they stop lots to pick people up and just sit for a while in a car park. Better to get a bit longer sleep and just go there directly. Some of the movies/themes are a bit outdated now like battlestar galactica and waterworld.

review_456779765,“The better Disneyland!”,"Filled with roller coasters, shows, shops and more, I absolutely love Universal Studios. My personal favourites from my last visit includes Spielberg's Lights Camera Action, the Guinness World Record Lights display, and the Transformers Ride (name). Starting with Spielberg's Lights Camera Action show, I love the way they compress the complex process of movie special effects into ten minutes. From the small details such as the sound of rain tapping at the side, to the large fiery explosion engulfing the set, the ten minute spectacle is certainly worth watching for anyone who has watched a movie, just for an idea of how it's done. Then the lights display.

review_456657966,“How to get your money's worth at USS”,"Enough has been said about the rides and attractions at USS so let me know just give you some tips on how to get there, where to store your backpack, how to save money, where to eat and other hacks. GETTING THERE:* We took a cab to Sentosa Island on our first day, While chatting with the cab driver, he used the phrase ""everything is money my friend"" which I experienced firsthand. From your research you might already arrived at a conclusion that getting inside sentosa involves an entry fee either through Sentosa Express (SGD4), taxi (SGD2-6, based on time of entry) or own car. But there is another option for people to enter Sentosa Island without paying anything. Yeah, you guessed it right, its the SENTOSA BOARDWALK. Situated at Level 1 of Vivo City mall, this 500m boardwalk take you to Sentosa Island free of charge and hey, you don't have to walk. Just take the travelator and enjoy the scenery en route. The boardwalk is free of cost upto 31st Dec'17. Its funny how you cannot see a single signboard pointing towards the boardwalk entry point. Get to L1 of Vivo City Mall and pass by the Tung Lok Signatures restaurant to get to the boardwalk.DRINKING WATER* Always carry an bottle with you to avoid purchase of water bottles at extra cost. All the rides have drinking water fountains to fill up on water. This applies to entire Singapore for that matter. We never purchased a bottle of water anywhere during our stay.FREE LOCKERS FOR YOU BACKPACK* You might have come across numerous posts advising you not to carry a backpack in USS since it might be a burden to carry around. Well, who DOESNT need a backpack right? I mean where are you going to store you towels, selfie sticks, change of clothes and snacks (shhhhhhhhh, you might get lucky if you play your cards right ;) )The trick is to keep the weight of the backpack to the bare minimum and use he free lockers available at some places. * There are free backpack storage places but they do come with a catch. They are free for only 45minutes after which you need to pay SGD4. However, there is no limit to the number of times you use the free lockers. All you need to do is check the waiting time for the ride and store the bags accordingly. There is a locker space available in Ancient Egypt section, where you can find the Revenge of the Mummy one of the best rides in USS. Also, it is close to The Lost World (Jurassic Park) where you can hop on the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, another awesome ride. Trick is to find the free locker spaces and use them wisely cos you only need one person to hold your space for the ride, if you catch my drift ;)PONCHO* Weather conditions are as unpredictable as the US Presidential Elections. It might rain anytime, anywhere. You just need to be equipped enough to face it and take advantage of it. Yes, I meant take advantage of it because people don't venture in rain, duh. That is where having a poncho can come to your rescue. Ponchos nothing but plastic raincoats made of thin material which serves its purpose at a much cheaper cost than purchasing an umbrella at USS @ USD10, ONLY. Ponchos are available at 2 for SGD5. You just need to ask for those.FOOD @ USS* Numerous restaurants and food carts are available inside USS but the prices come to an average of SGD10 if you want to purchase anything. It is mentioned clearly that outside food/snacks are not allowed inside but they do not check you bags inside out. They just ask you to open up and show the items inside. So it is up to you to purchase food/snacks/drinks inside USS or sneak some inside *wink wink*TIPS:1. Finish all the popular rides like Battle Star Galactica (sci-fi city, roller coaster), Revenge of the Mummy (Ancient Egypt), Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure and Canopy Flyer (The Lost World), during the lunch break when the waiting times are less. 2. Checkout the timings of shows like Waterwold (The Lost World), Sesame Street (New York) and be there ahead of time to beat the queue.3. Try to plan your visit during the middle of the week like Tues, Wed. Waiting time might climb to even 90minutes during peak season and public holidays.4. Get a Universal Express entry pass if you want to beat the line, not applicable only for a few rides.If you research and plan your trip to USS properly, you can get the maximum out it. Definitely would recommend to everyone across different age groups.

I first tried Transformers since it's indoor, and then I tried Battlestar Galactica Human, it was not really scary as I thought. If you want more extreme you should try Cylon one. The revenge of the mummy was a really nive experience because you ride roller coaster indoor and dark. it was really good.

review_456620861,“Fun filled family day - Sad about the rain!”,"We had a great time at Universal Studios Singapore. It was fun rides for the whole family, great food and loads to see and explore. It was a bit humid and warm on arrival but this soon changed as we were about 1/4 into the park. It started raining...more like pouring down with thunder galore. This was such a pity because the whole park comes to a standstill and all except 2-3 rides stop working if there is thunder accompanying the rain. Luckily we went prepared with some ponchos in our bags, but even this was not enough for the down pouring because we were walking around in water about ankle high. We ultimately missed about 2-3 hours in our day just standing around under shelter waiting for the rain to subside which eventually did but because there was still thunder warnings the park remained to close the rides. I would def visit this park again, I would just plan to miss the rain and go on a sunny day. But seeing that Singapore has rain pretty much everyday I don't know why the creators didn't plan for the park to be more equipped to function in the rain or accommodate their visitors. We flew into Singapore and only had the one day to make Universal Studios work, so sad for us. And you pay quite a bit for tickets, so again...make it work for the visitors and instead having 80% of the park under rain and only 20% under roof in a tropical place with rain all the time....the math is a bit off I should say. It just leaves sad faces on kids that had been excited for this visit for weeks. What did save us was the booking of tickets online and the express passes. We only bought the package allowing one express pass and this helped us getting most of the rides in once the park opened fully again. The ques were endless since it was over peak season. So well worth the extra couple of bucks paid. We had our 5, 10, 16 yrs old boys with us. Got some great shots to remember and relived some of the family favorite movies!!

We started from the entrance then went left for kids at far far away land then jerrasic park land then Egypt lands then sci fic where transformers are, in between them both lovely roller coasters very fast, then we ended at new York lands, for more fun i advice you at the entrance to buy the fast track where its very very useful we couldn't finish all zones at one day without it.. each ride that takes 45 m waiting line it took us 5 min to ride .. plus if you are single you can also use the fast track express as a single rider in most rides. Water lands opens at 3 pm .. also look at the schedule of the shows and try to catch up especially in new york the dancing band are very good. I didnt buy anything from stores to not carry many toys and gifts because the universal store at the gate have almost everything and every character u will see inside, so i bought when i was leaving just next to the gate, out side you can find some nice restaurants for dinner.

On the way in, we asked about the price of ""fast pass"" tickets and it was 80 dollars each. Quite expensive on top of tickets, so had a think about it. Within ten minutes of asking the price, we went to buy them, only to be told they were now 100 dollars each! Unbelievable, but apparently this is normal practice. If the place is busy, they hike up the price. Absolutely disgraceful! Have been to Universal studios in other countries, have never known this happen.

review_456306177,“Fun times and short lines but don't forget a poncho!”,"This is a manageable sized theme park that requires all day to see! Went on a rainy weekday (albeit in school holidays for Chinese New Year) which meant it was a bit quieter, but they do close the outdoor rollercoasters when lightning in the vicinity so pick your day carefully. The lines were not that long (our longest wait was 40 mins for the river rapids ride) on average 20 minutes. There aren't that many rides and many of them are more suited to younger kids. Only about four or five thrill seeking ones. Our favourite rides were the Mummy Underground Rollercoaster and the Transformers 4D ride. The river rapids ride was good got drenched (forgot the poncho!) but they had drying pods for $5. I could see how there could be long queues at busy times. My top tip, if you can manage it wait until the end of the day... no lines at all for the last hour before closing time! A must do on Sentosa

review_456304053,“Interesting ”,"We visited universal studios on a Tuesday, it was quite busy as it was the week following Chinese New Year. The entry staff and staff on most attractions were lovely, very helpful and cheerful, although came across a few moody ones! We got unlimited express tickets so we skip all the ques straight to he front which was definitely worth it! Some ques were over 2 hours long! Although around 3 rides didn't have express lines available which was annoying as we paid so much money for these tickets. We watched waterworld performance which was amazing! Although they didn't announce you couldn't use phones/take photos and the person in front of us got told off then asked to leave for having her phone out, which was rude of the universal worker. I understand how the show should be kept a secret so it's unspoilt for new customers, although if you go on YouTube there's the whole performance on video anyway. The bigger rides, mummy and transformers were my favourite! Some of the others were boring but I guess that's my personal preference. Food was very expensive onsite but you could leave and re enter the park as many times within the day you've paid so we went outside had lunch that came back into the park. I must say overall a very good day, filled with lots of fun! If you go outside universal and head straight it goes to a river at 8pm there is a crane performance, two birds which fall in love and there's fireworks etc, it's very pretty! Overall a really good day!

It all started when we entered the park and found that dreamy Minions mart. We wanted to stay there forever! We started with the Sci-Fi City which had the thrilling Transformers ride which is the 1st of its kind in the world. Bumblebee was there when we got outside & it was such a pleasure meeting it in person! Lost world had some Jurassic Park fantastic rides, especially the Rapids ride. Ancient Egypt was nice but we didn't have much time to try its rides. Then we headed to Far Far Away which had funny Shrek 4D adventure & the cool Donkey show. In addition, Madagascar was amazing and the Crate adventure was supreme! It was a very special moment when we met the MINIONS at 6 PM and took memorable photos with them. Also the park had great cafeterias and cafes which served nice cold drinks & snacks. Universal Studios Singapore was one hell of an adventure and we'll be back again for sure one day.

Mean while we got straight into the Shrek movie with no waiting. All in all a great day out for the whole family. A few points to remember:It very hot from 10.30 - 4 so wear your sunscreen and definitely a hat.Drink lots of water.No need for a poncho, really on a water ride? ""You might get wet the signs say"" - uh you are going on a water ride people, just get a bit wet.The water world show is worth seeing, if not to just sit down for a while and rest in the shade.The Express pass is probably worth investing in if you don't like queues, although its about $40. We would have only used it only 3 rides so for us not worth the extra money.Get there Early around 10am when the park opens and spend 4 or 5 hours there straight. Don't eat the food at the park and have lunch back the the shopping center where you join the mono rail to get there. The food is expensive and it's crap anyway.We will definitely be back on our next visit to Singapore. 8 or 9 out of 10. If you are reading our review we are a young at heart couple between 40 - 46.

review_455463319,“Don't go on a special holiday 😱”,"We attended yesterday which was on Chinese New Year. 1. It was CRAZY busy and then Universal raises the price of the express pass from $30 limited express pass to $70 and $50 unlimited access to $120 because it's a holiday. You have to get one unless you are fine to stand in a line for 40 to 60 minutes to enjoy a ride. Under 4 requires an express pass too...2. Kiddie rides (well what I feel should be for kids only) such as Seasame Street, Treasure Hunters, Dino Flyer and Madagascar Carasol has hundreds of adults without children riding on them which means that kids have to wait in long lines to enable them to enjoy the rides.We love USS and will definitely be back just not on a holiday again

review_455347635,“Fun! Expensive! Small!”,"All in all, I've been to this park several times in a year. Twice for Halloween Horror Nights and multiple times on a regular day. I suggest buying the fast past if you're going on the weekend because the cues are not worth the wait. I also suggest in bringing ponchos if you're going to do the Jurassic world. Remember to bring a water bottle so you don't have to pay for the bottled ones. You can refill them at the fountains.

review_455340163,“Fantastic fun filled day”,"Fantastic day, fun for all ages and all levels of thrill seekers. We paid for the express pass which allows one time express queue for each ride. That was money well spent as the longest we waited for a ride was about 10 minutes when the wait times were 1 hour for the popular rides. All the rides were great my favourites were the Transformer, both Battlestar Galactic rides and for a bit less hectic the Jurassic Rapids Adventure. The shows like Lights Camera Action were great. Unfortunately we missed the WaterWorld show as the last show starts at 1 pm, so I would make that a priority to get there early as only 2 shows a day. We left at 7 pm when they closed the gates, 8 hours of absolute fun.

review_455291648,“First timers at Universal”,"We visited Universal Singapore on a wet rainy Monday mid morning. When we arrived lots of rides were closed due to technical issues, rain issues or just not working. We nearly walked back out again and wanted to demand our money back! But after the rain held off, things slowly started to open up again. Top rides for our kids were Transformer ride and the Jurassic Park water rapid ride. Top rides for adults were Revenge of the Mummy and Battle Star Galactica. Best for young kids is Shrek 4-D experience, the gentle rides in Jurassic park and walking around Hollywood. We ended up spending 6hrs there and that was sufficient as we were lucky there weren't too many long queues. Our max waiting time was 30mins.

review_454680736,“A great day out but...!”,"There's plenty to like about Universal Studios on Sentosa Island, beginning with the very scenic location, but there are also some shortcomings.First of all it must be said that the grounds are very well maintained and the presentation is first class. I suggest an Express Pass is essential if you hope to catch a reasonable amount of rides and attractions. Some people waited in excess of one hour for entry to a ride, where-as with our passes our longest wait was about 15 minutes. The rides themselves were pretty spectacular but the WaterWorld show made me cringe. Plenty of bangs, smoke and overdone American bravado, but frankly it was kindergarten playtime. Couldn't wait for it to end but I was clearly in the minority in this regard. I'd suggest job satisfaction is not high at Universal, the staff carry out their duties with little sign of interest and frankly, appear pretty bored with their lot.Our greatest disappointment came with the outrageous prices they charge for food and drinks. $50 for a pizza and $6 for a machine made coffee. That's not a typo... $50 for a pizza worth no more than $15. So, a great day out but...!

review_454602435,“Great day”,"Booked and printed tickets online prior to heading out. Getting there - so cheap and easy to get a taxi out to Sentosa. Line took about 10 minutes once gates were opened. Pretty good compared to elsewhere in the world. They are very strict about bringing in your own food etc...As has been mentioned plenty of times a Express Pass is an absolute must for this place. The park was not that busy the day we went but the Express Pass probably saved us about 2 hours of queuing. On a busy day I think it would save at least 4 hours, more likely 6.We loved the rides. Our kids are 11, 9 and 6. I think this is really the sweet spot for this place. Older teenagers would probably be fairly unimpressed with the level of thrills on the rides. But for us it was perfect. Good size park. Plenty to do. Highly recommended.A hassle getting off Sentosa with taxi queue taking about 40 minutes.

The only criticism I would make is that the queue length timers were not updated at all correctly on the day we went along. The kids went to ride on the Human Battlestar Galactica ride when the queue length said 10 minutes. They emerged from the ride over an hour later. This ruined most of the day as we missed some attractions.

There are so many things to do that initially you feel that one day will not be enough but you can manage to do everything with some luck and planning.There are attractions for everyone from young toddlers to someone who's looking for hard core roller coaster ride.Advice: If you are visiting during holiday season it is advisable to buy express pass that helps reducing the waiting time drastically. The express pass fee changes as per the no of people expected to visit and ranges anywhere between 40-80 SGD. But its worth it.

review_454409483,“A full on day with attractions for all ages”,"We were a little worried that Universal Studios Singapore would be geared more towards young children rather than adults - but happily we were wrong.There were several lands / zones, most with a mixture of things for children and adults to do.We have already visited Universal Studios Hollywood - some of the rides appeared to be replicated. Jurassic Park and The Mummy were similar to the Hollywood rides, but not the same, so it's worth having another go. The transformers ride is the same - but I loved it the first time, and loved it just as much the second. Battlestar Galactica was a huge hit - without giving it away it's our suggestion that you do both sides of the roller coaster and start with ""human"".Some things that are good to know:• There is a compulsory bag check at the gate, you cannot take outside food into the park• You cannot film or take pictures on any of the rides except the Madagascar boat ride - this is different to the LA park where they even encouraged it and took photos for you• You will be able to tell pretty quickly if you need the ""express pass"" we had a 40 minute wait for our first ride and we were there at opening, so we promptly purchased the express pass. The wait for the Battlestar Galactica ride was 100 minutes, the Jurassic Park boat ride was 100 minutes and The Mummy was 45 minutes • You get extremely wet on the Jurassic Park ride - particularly your footwear• Many of the rides do not allow you to take ANYTHING on, in fact the have metal detectors on the line... so if it's one of those rides stow your belongings in a locker before approaching the line, save yourself some time• We arrived at 10am and with the express park got through all the attractions we wanted to visit by 4pm - there is a lot to see, it's a big day• Same system with the photography as the Hollywood park, you get your barcode card on your first photo and take it with you, there are several photo points in the park. Some rides are unattended so you need to write down the number or take a photo to add it to your account at the end when you check out• There is NO studio tourWe had a great day and would recommend the park - particularly the Battlestar Galactica roller coasters We were able to secure our tickets through the website ""Voyagin"" for a discounted price, so check that out, it makes the ""express pass"" a little more financially viable.Santosa Island is accessible via the Vivo shopping complex on the #10 bus run or the Yellow train line. You can walk the boardwalk (with travelators) for free or catch the monorail for $4 (which you can use your ezy-link card for).

review_454406877,“The teenager in all of you will love this!”,"This is a rides based theme park loosely based on a number of Universal Studio's movies. From merry go rounds to roller coasters this park ticks all the boxes but will especially appeal to teenagers with a lot of high-speed activities where you get shaken about and rolled upside down. For parents with young children be aware that a lot of the attractions have minimum height and weight restrictions. For the elderly, how adventurous do you feel? Oh and there's always Shrek.

The park opens at 10 be there earlier to get tickets of you didn't purchase online.2. They currently have a MasterCard promotion you get 10% off? and a $5meal voucher if you pay using a MasterCard. 3. Buy your express pass. 4. Assuming you got they're early the cues are short, goto sci-fi world and ride the two big rollercoasters (battle star galactic) there without using your express pass. You can't have anything in your pockets, there are lockers there which are free for 45mins. If the transformers ride had a short cue do the same.5. The mummy / Egyptian ride opens at 11. So go there next. Again if the cue is short save your express pass so you can use it later.6. Go and do the rest of the park. Come back to transformers, the battle star galactic rides and the mummy.7. We went mid week, was quiet but we zipped though cues. The park is really well laid out, its very small but you can easily do it in a day. Food is really expensive and average quality. The shopping center that you get the train to sentosa has much better options but you will need to leave the park.

It consumes a whole day and mind you it could be quite tiring in case you wish to enjoy all the attractions. It is quite a sprawling place. It is like a mini disneyland. The best part is all attractions are included in your admission ticket.No extras. in case you have time visit Universal Studios only on a week day if you wish to enjoy it fully. On saturdays/sundays and holidays the waiting period at each attraction could be 45-60 mins.All attractions are of high technology to give you a very wonderful and satisfying experience. It also lets you peep into cultures and history of different continents. The architecture inside is a treat to the eyes with dummy shops, theaters, cinema halls etc. to give you a STREET feeling.

review_453238356,“The best with the most amazing rides”,"Coming to Singapore and not visiting the USS, is just not fair!The magnificent entry through those simple gates excites you about what would be next inside. Be it any ride, be it any show, be it anything at any corner , it's just amazing! USS has all sorts of rides, for everyone. I cannot say that there's a specific ride that I liked among others...all are equally amazing.Be it Waterworld, be it Transformers, be it the Steven Speilberg Show, be it Jurrasic Park, Sci-Fi City, New York, any any...all are simply amazing!One must go there!

review_453131179,“Awesome. Jan is the time to go”,"Gates open at 10am, we got there at 9h30.No queues at ticket booth. Did not buy any fast pass. Gates were still closed so we queued to enter. We did all the popular rides 1st. Transformers, Battlestar, revenge of the mummy's, lights camera action, jurassic park Rapids adventure, Shrek. Queues where no longer than 15 minutes. By the time we where done it started getting very busy. We hadn't taken any pics as yet. So we started at the beginning taking as many pics as we could and seeing what we didn't see the 1st time round. We also did all the other rides we didn't do 1st time round. Had lunch and took it easy. Saw everything did everything. Was no need for fast pass or to rush. Kids thoroughly enjoyed themselves, even went on a few rides again. Did some souvenir shopping and where out the park before 6pm. Awesome day.

review_452907465,“Excellent experience”,"The amusement park itself is not going to thought only ride there and back by cable car. But this ""round-trip"" had to lay the whole day! There are several stations, each very interesting, you can go out for a walk indefinitely. The entrance fee is not necessary to the park. there is even a manmade islands and sandy beach! Very unusual and interesting! It is a pity that it is not taken for this whole day, it was possible to change the day at the zoo for a day on the cable car. Most liked the Mummy, Transformers and 2 large twisted slides (on one leg standing on the bottom of the booth, on the other - are hanging in the air, the second worse) show Spielberg.Show Water World seemed more aggressive and prolonged, with Shrek Movies - the movie funny, but the long and boring to stand in the ""waiting room"", is telling.Jurassic Period - the most popular attraction, judging from the queue; think about whether you need to go. Nothing special, but at the end of those who are not fortunate to be completely doused with water. We are not lucky my daughter and one man, the daughter was completely (completely full) wet, I was partially wet clothes and shoes completely wet.No hair dryers, which are outside (though badly paid - $ 2 for a few minutes drying) did not change the situation even by 1%.

Was very impressed that this theme park had well signed Halal restaurants. This was helpful. Also was very impressed that was a well marked prayer area in the park. This too was helpful. Overall a very impressive visit. Very comparable to Orlando.

review_452542809,“Don't go: Singapore's biggest rip off”,"We had the most expensive bad day out at USS. The service is shocking. We got there early, queued 90 minutes anyway for 'Transformers', to be turned away by a loudspeaker announcement that it had broken down. There was no information about waiting times in the queue and not a staff member in sight, even when it had broken down. No explanation, no apology, no fast pass for later, nothing. So, we moved on to Jurassic World, by this time it was 12 noon. We were told the queue was under 1 hr, so we were happy we would make it to the Waterworld show at 1.30. The queue was actually 90 minutes, the ride nothing special, and we missed the show. We went on a couple of the no-queue rides appropriate for nervous grannies just to do something, then left (after the world's worst hot dog). For our family of 5 this joy cost us $320. Please no one chip in and suggest we should have paid an extra $150 for express passes - this was not in our budget. We have been to theme parks before and don't mind queuing for some rides, but at USS it was totally impossible to get our money's worth. Bear in mind that for our first 3.5 hours in the park the only thing we had done was stand in hot queues. Don't go. Avoid making your kids aware of the existence of USS (mine completely agreed it was rubbish). Singapore has loads of other lovely things to do: save the theme parks for the US or Eurodisney.

review_452524036,“An anniversary well spent”,"Visited USS on our anniversary, and cant say it wasnt a wise decision. Took a cab n reached early by 9.30. But found out that we could have saved 33 sgd on each ticket and avoided the que, if we would have booked online. But regardless, Even for 74 sgd per person, it was worth every penny. N to top it all, we also caught a glimpse of the christmas special shows. Make sure to carry your own sipper or bottle, else you'll end up spending a lot on water n drinks. Also keep an extra pair of clothes, as your existing one's might get wet in the waterworld show and ride.

During busy periods, the fast track is definitely recommended to get the most out of the park.The water world show was impressive too!

review_452510733,“Easy to reach and travel inside. Good fun for kids. Rides are so-so. Plan your day ahead.”,"Very easy to reach either by taxi or public transport. Taxi/uber/grab preferred - there may be charges on car and cab entrance on some days. Do plan your day ahead as doing all rides in one day may not be possible. Can get very crowded, hence wait times at major rides may be 2 hours+. Rides are comparatively easy. I would suggest doing the whole Sentosa. Take tickets online (from sites such as klook) to save time - just scan the barcode for entry. Do not take the Jeep safari - complete let down.

Plenty to keep us busy all day. The single rider lanes were excellent as they save you lots of time queueing at some rides. Make sure you go to the popular rides first e.g. Jurassic park river ride, Egyptian mummy ride, battle star gala to a roller coasters. These were very good. If you can afford a fast pass then that is the way to go. Fun for teenagers and parents alike. Will cost you about $15-20 each for lunch. Drink and a fish sandwich, chicken wrap etc . You will get wet on some of the rides. If you have a rain poncho then bring it. Fun day for all.

review_452306805,“Great place and guaranteed fun”,"Universal Studios is an obvious attraction in Singapore. So, it is big on the agenda. Plus the added attraction of it being situated @ Sentosa Island, a complete entertainment and tourist zone of Singapore. On top of that, it's an island. So, the anticipation and expectation are more.And must say it lives up to its name. It has zones like Hollywood, New York, Sci-Fi city, Ancient Egypt, Lost World, Far Far Away and Madagascar. Most of the rides are very nice and some of them are overhyped. I will give a review of all the rides that we experienced followed by tips/observations. But, must say it is a relatively smaller amusement park compared to say Disneyland and Ocean's Park @ Hongkong. In terms of concept, it is quite similar to Disneyland. In a nutshell, it is somewhere between Disneyland and Ocean's Park. Comparable to Ocean's Park in terms of adrenalin led rides and to Disneyland in terms of the wow factor associated with movies and movie characters.Review of rides:1. Transformers The Ride (Sci-Fi City) - the best one in Universal Studios. Please go for this. It is a thrilling experience where around 8 people are put on a car and then you are taken through a battle between the Autobots and Decepticons. Even kids of 5-6 years of age can attend. My daughter (6 yrs.) thoroughly enjoyed. So, this should be your first ride. 2. Human vs. Cylon (Sci-Fi City) - the zig-zagging roller coaster. I think Human is the red one and Cylon is the grey one. I went for the latter which looked more dangerous and in which you are hanging from the top. In Human, you are sitting on top. That's the difference. I think Cylon has more dangerous flips, turns, etc. And I thoroughly enjoyed it. So, people who love roller coaster, please go for this.3. Revenge of the Mummy (Ancient Egypt) - a very interesting roller coaster which mostly operates in the dark with sudden drops, fire, sound, etc. I think small kids will be scared of this. Since it is mostly in the dark, there is a sense of anticipation and fear of the unknown. And in one particular moment, from a brief stationary situation, suddenly the ride car plunges down in the dark. Most thrilling. Please go for this if you like fear of the unknown!!4. Canopy Flyer (Lost World) - very nice ride on a reduced speed roller coaster. Great to go with kids.5. Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (Lost World) - very thrilling. And you might be warned of getting wet. Well, trust me, you do have chances of getting wet, but it is not so much. So, don't bother to put your bags in the locker (on rent) or buy ponchos while entering. Not necessary. You are made to sit on a rubber inflated dingy kind of a thing which goes through rapids amongst dinosaurs, etc. All of us enjoyed a lot including my 6-year-old daughter.6. Puss in Boots' Giant Journey (Far Far Away) - Again a roller coaster which both my daughters (6 yrs and 14 years) enjoyed. 7. Shrek 4D Adventure (Far Far Away) - over hyped for sure. It is one of those typical air being blown on your backs and water being sprayed while you watch in 3D Shrek and Donkey on an adventure. Before you go to the main hall, there is this boring lecture of the adventure you are about to take. We found it a complete waste of time.8. Madagascar: A Crate Adventure - the most boring boat ride on earth. Please avoidTips/observations/things to watch out for:1. How to reach using public transport - The best way is to reach Harbour Front MRT on the North East Line and the Circle Line. From there you walk through VivoCity Mall to reach the Sentosa Express station which is located right on top of VivoCity Mall. Just keep taking the escalator up to reach the station from where Sentosa Express starts which is a monorail. In 5 minutes, you cross the short stretch of sea between mainland Singapore and Sentosa Island to reach Waterfront station which is where Universal Studios and S.A. Aquarium are located. 2. The park opens at 10 am and we went on a weekday when there was not too much of rush. The first thing to do is to rush for Transformers ride so that you don't get a queue later. We didn't get any queue yet it took us almost 15 minutes to get onto the ride. So, you can imagine if there is a queue. If you have online tickets, straight move to the entry gate. Please keep your online ticket print out with you because if you move out of the park and want to come back they require the online ticket print out once again in addition to some invisible mark they put on your arms.3. Duration of stay - if you spend time from 10 am to 5 pm its more than enough. You can enjoy most of the worthwhile rides, see most of the shows held at designated times, have a relaxed lunch and explore the whole park without any rush. I feel even if you have half a day, it is enough. Please go on a weekday as there is not too much of a rush and you will not need the premium pass or band for the rides. Maximum waiting time for each ride will be 20 minutes. We started at 10 am and were there till 1.30 pm post which we walked down to S.A. Aquarium (which is right next door) and spent around 2 hours there. We then came back to Universal Studios at around 4 pm. Then we were there till around 6 pm. We then moved on to explore other parts of Sentosa Island like Merlion statue (at Imbiah station) and the Wings of Life show (at Beach Station) which was out of the world. So, if you are going for the full day to Sentosa, please remember to keep enough time for other stuff there and not spend too much time at Universal Studios.4. Where to eat - I would strongly recommend the grilled chicken at Goldilocks restaurant (indoor and outdoor) and also followed by their signature ice cream collection. I read about the grilled chicken in TA and I must thank that soul who recommended that. The grilled chicken is simply too good. Please don't miss it. Kids will enjoy too.5. Necessary to carry - water bottles are a must which you will need to keep refilling from time to time. People sensitive to heat and sunlight please carry umbrellas because the heat and sunlight can be quite strong. You get strollers for kids there so take one if you have a complaining kid who doesn't like to walk. Please pick up a park map before entering so that at least you can locate Transformers ride before anything else!!6. Where to book tickets - I would strongly recommend booking through klook. You get the maximum discount which is more than voyagin which is the other one which gives a good discount. And you will have no issues with klook at least which I used.7. The Minion store - please visit the Minion store @ Hollywood area (near the entrance). It is a good time pass and has lots of interesting Minion merchandise, which is very expensive, though.To summarise, its a nice place to go with kids. Everybody enjoys here. Though the number of rides and the area is limited compared to other parks. Transformers is the ride here which must be experienced. The fact that Universal Studios is located at Sentosa Island makes it even more unique. Don't forget to click that must have photograph in front of the Universal Studios globe model right at the entrance! One must plan a full day @ Sentosa Island from morning 10 am till night 10 pm. There are lots of things to see, do and experience. Sentosa Island is really awesome!!

review_451599969,“A good all day experience ”,"Definitely one of the best value attractions in Singapore! We went at about 11am and stayed for a good few hours, although it was a bit confusing getting into Sentosa and then getting tickets into the park. You need to buy a Sentosa monorail ticket to get into the island - the ticket que can be long but hardly anyone was using the automated ticket machines. We used the machines without issue. The ticket cost 4SGD. Universal is at the first stop of the monorail and a short walk from the station. When you get to the ticketing booth, spend that little bit extra and get the ""universal express"" pass. We skipped the que at all the rides and easily saved at least 30-60 minutes at each ride. Definitely worth the extra money. The best rides were the battlestar galactica roller coaster, return of the mummy coaster and the Jurassic park water rapids ride. You will get wet with the water rides. All in all it was a great experience and would definitely come again.

Subtle but noticeable for anyone whose been here numerous times.The update in the Transformers ride is great, especially with the smoke machine. The ambience is so much better!Maintenance in Madagascar made the ride so much better. The new audio clips too.The rapids, you guys, I could kiss you! The rapids used to be a little slow and than in the tunnel it picked up, but now! Wow wow wow. Crazy speeds in the rapids. Definitely, this is Universal Studios! The tides and waves with the new speed is awesome.Still disappointed that the canopy has no express queue. Bring it back! Why was it removed in the first place. Ugh.Shrek was not so great. Sat on the right on the 2nd row and we were hardly moving. No wind from the back, no spiders on our legs. Boo.The people mending the exit were so sour. So friendly to all the guests but us, maybe because we are annual holders so it didn't matter? Sad. The rapids made me so happy. And my favourite ride is still my little dragon coaster!

Ceylon was awesome too, blue being the best and most exciting among the two lines. The other rides were fun but our favourite was the underrated The Mummy ride. Not too sure if this is still there for its been a while and this review is way overdue but if its still there, you would know why we took this ride about 8 times since there weren't any queue due to the sudden thunderstorm. Overall a fun place to visit with your friends.

review_451277278,“Great day out”,"Small but a great day out. Would advise to purchase tickets in advance to avoid waiting but we got a good discount by purchasing our tickets at the booth with a master card. Very clean as you would expect in Singapore. First visit without any children to a theme park but had a great time. Biggest wait was for the rapids so do that one early ( you get extremely wet on this one ! ), strangely the most enjoyable ride was the Transformers ! but all really enjoyable. If you want to meet characters check the timings on the way in.

The roller coaster rides were very interesting but do expect a very long wait for your turn if you buy a normal ticket. We waited for almost 2 and a half hours!

review_451122168,“Wonderful... if you know a few tricks to skip the queues”,"Visited on a blistering hot day in December. with my 9-year -old niece. If you can shell out an extra S$60 per person for the express pass, that's great. Otherwise, be prepared to foot-numbing waiting times of up to 90 minutes for the popular rides. We used the single rider option to have a go on 3-4 rides. Felt good to get on a ride within 5 minutes when people had been waiting for one and a half hours! Most rides at USS seemed unsuitable for very young kids - HongKong Disneyland is probably a better bet for families with toddlers. My 9-year-old was disappointed because there was nothing Harry Potter here. But overall, not a bad way to spend the day if you enjoy theme parks in general. The 1.5 hour wait for a taxi back to the hotel was the most unpleasant part of our experience.

review_450929940,“A must visit”,"If this is your time time to Singapore, you need to visit the Universal Studio. The entire park can be covered within 3 to 5 hours. The transformer ride is one of the best. The jurassic park ride pales in comparison with Osaka's Universal Studio because it is a much smaller park. The set up for the mummies ride from the entrance and all the way to the ride itself is very well developed. A favourite tourist spot.

It's certainly a step-up from British theme parks in terms of overall atmosphere; it has several excellent rides but maybe not the depth I wanted.

review_450895567,“VIP Tour Experience a Must Do!”,"A first time visit to Universal Studios in Singapore and with only a day to do it. We decided to spend the extra and book the VIP Tour. We were a bit hesitant at first as we generally like to see attractions at our own pace.We are so glad we did. We booked directly online and not through the many travel agents advertising the same. We saved money doing so, but was still $268.00 per person. For this we got our ticket, express pass, which enabled you to skip the lines after the tour finished, access to the VIP lounge, and a dedicated tour guide for 6 hrs. You also get a lunch voucher for $25.00 each and 10% discount at food stores and clothing outlets. Jethro was our guide, he was excellent and really enjoyed taking us around. He planned out what we wanted to do for the day and made sure we saw everything we wanted. He gave us behind the scenes tours and explained all the rides and shows. There were VIP areas for the shows and we didn't have to wait for any rides. We could also ride as many times as we liked.It was a great day and experience and something we would do again. Well worth the investment for what you got.

review_450878717,“Worth doing in one day!”,"US can be done in only one day and we made it! But you need to be smart on how to approach the studio and you have to know things in advance to be effective. I will try to summarize how, in my personal opinion, one can enjoy and see as much as possible in one day. 1) I start with the ‘better not to’: - as soon as you get in, taking pictures and souvenirs (will have time at the end). Need to go to attractions first to avoid queuing - wear trainers and sneakers (can get wet in the Jurassic Park Rapids) 2) ‘Better to’ list: - Buy the tickets on-line!!!!! The print-at-home function will give you immediate access into the park without needing to stop at a ticket counter (a lot of time saved). - Bring your own bottles of water. You can refill them there. - Bring snacks/food if you can. This will help you to avoid the humongous queues during lunchtime (from 11.30 to 1.30) and you can go to do some of the attractions whilst the other people are eating. - Have ponchos at home? Bring them! This will avoid you to buy one for the Jurassic park Adventure or for the Waterworld show. If you haven’t them, go and buy them at the USS store BEFORE hand. Otherwise you will end up doing what most people do: buying them whilst queuing or not buying them at all because you don’t have cash or you left your back pack in one of the storage areas. - Wear flip flops! We also brought a change of clothing. Just to be on the safe side. - Hats and sunscreen will be helpful too - Check promotions and events on their website – unfortunately I cannot post the link here for your convenience, otherwise they reject my review....already happened once.......3) order of attractions (queue based). Some of the attractions can reach up to 2 hours of queue, so better beat the crowd and do them at the beginning! - Transformers the ride - Battlestar Galactica Human & Cylon (the queue here is not that bad, but I would do it now just because after lunch it could be a little bit too much for your stomach…..) - Jurassic park rapids adventure - Canopy flyer - Treasure hunters - Shrek 4D adventure - Madagascar : a crate adventure - Revenge of the mummy Once you have done these ones, go ahead and enjoy other shows/attractions that you like the most. Chances are you have saved a couple of hours of queuing ;-)

review_450792192,“AWESOME Theme park!!! MUST GO!”,"We absolutely loved this theme park! We are from NZ and we have nothing that can even compare to this theme park. The rides were fantastic, the park was clean, you felt safe there and there is so much to do and see. We purchased the express pass and this is defiantly great value for money. Lucky for us the queues were not big anyway but the express pass meant we pretty much did not wait for any rides at all. On a busy day you will defiantly want the express pass. Transformers ride was my favourite and I would suggest getting to this ride first! It absolutely bucketed with rain while we were there, this shut down all outdoor rides but there is still plenty to do inside. Rain stopped every now and again which meant we were still able to do the outside rides we wanted to. Definatly give yourself a FULL day as you will need this if the park is busy, I could see the potential for hour long queue delays!

review_450435450,“Must visit!”,"This must be on top of your list if you are a first time SG tourist. Put this in your weekday schedule and start at 10am if you want to avoid the crown and long queues. Weekend or holidays could take you hours to line up for just one ride. Thus, if weekend is inevitable, get the express pass available at any store inside the park. 50sgd per person is worth it! Also, as soon as you enter the park, get a list of show schedule available at the entrance so you can manage and optimize your time inside the park.

review_450386530,“Great Day Out”,"We're in Singapore for a 3 day holiday, and our visit to Universal Studios was the highlight of our trip. Although our son wasn't able to ride many rides since he's a small 4 year old, there was still much for him to enjoy. One of the rides that he was tall enough to ride, I wish he hadn't. The Puss in Boots' Giant Journey was a nice ride, but too fast and scary for our 4 year old. It's a good thing that it was a quick ride. He really enjoyed the Madagascar Crate Adventure, Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase and Treasure Hunters. We weren't able to catch many shows, due to their timings and our schedule, but we did catch The Rockafellas B-boy dancing show. It was awesome. Very entertaining with great dancing. The dancers interact really well with the audience and they deserve all the applause. We had lunch at Mel's Diner and it was just ok. They offer burgers and fries, hotdogs, chicken sandwiches, typical fast food fare that wasn't anything special. I wish we would have chosen a different restaurant , but it didn't ruin our wonderful experience. We'll surely come again once our son is old enough to enjoy more of what the park has to offer!

It is easy to be assessed just by taking the Sentosa Express at Harbourfront station by taking the circle/ north east line from your previous location.

review_450316025,“Great time had by all - Buy the unlimited express pass”,"This was our second visit to Universal and last time the dual rollercoasters were not operating and the puss in boots ride had not been completed. We stayed from opening to closing and invested in the unlimited express passes. This was the best decision we made with waits of up to 80 minutes on the roller coaster at one stage for the normal queue, and only 20 min for express pass holders. Throughout the day this was constant - we were walking past hundreds of people waiting in the regular queue waiting for ages only to jump right on the ride. This allowed us to pick and choose several rides to have numerous turns at. The only down side was the huge cost and poor value of food and beverage outlets. We paid S$6.50 for a water! given no outside food and drinks are allowed (and there are bag checks at the entrance), I find this too much to pay. Additionally, we bought an afternoon snack of fries for S$5 which had about a handful in it. Paying up to S$40 for a t-shirt also left us with a bad taste in our mouths. When comparing to Disneyland Hong Kong, the prices were extraordinarily high and seem to be much higher than the last time we visited 3 years ago.On a positive note, customer safety seems to be critical with staff very professional and welcoming and keeping everyone informed of any delays. Make sure you take enough time to spend there and plan your day around the parades and visits from the characters. Big kids will love the thrill rides of the roller coasters and the Mummy and Transformers ride and little kids have a good selection too.

review_450313928,“Felt like a kid again”,"Recommend getting the express passes, definitely a must to skip the 40 minute plus queues. Recommend getting there before open time and once the gates open go to either of your express pass rides either transformers or the mummy - both good and suitable for children. We managed to get into transformers and the mummy straight away without using our fast pass, so we were able to use these later on in the day to skip the queue. Definitely need a full day to get around all the rides. Had the time of my life! Felt like a kid again all hyped up on sugar and popcorn.

review_450166250,“ Buy the unlimited express pass”,"All in, Universal has a good variety of different rides, and whilst not as good as the parks in Japan and Orlando, it is far better than California. There are 2 fairly extreme roller coasters and an assortment of 4d and less extreme ridesWe visited on Christmas Day and fortunately had prepurchased the tickets (through discount site, Klook) and unlimited express pass ( through the universal site). Doing so was a saving grace. The kids were able to ride their favourites numerous times throughout the day and allowed us to skip queues that had a wait of up to 90 minutes in some cases. Furthermore, there was a pretty substantial electrical storm at 4.00pm which lasted a couple of hours ( a common occurrence In Singapore). Most of the outdoor rides were closed during that time. So if we had not had the passes, it is unlikely that we would have ridden each ride more than once, or even at all during our day there.

review_450080169,“Stupendous”,"Notwithstanding my travel engagements to several parts of the world, I have never visited an amusement park ever ! Universal Studios Singapore was rated #1 amongst all must-see attractions, and being an ardent TripAdvisor follower I decided to take the plunge and purchased 2 Adults and 2 children tickets. The Adult tickets also gave us a complimentary $25 dollar bottle(which was redeemed at the Discovery food centre)- the kids love this, and still continue to cherish their memories. We also purchased the Universal Express Unlimited pass which cost us $80 per head(as we got them online), and wouldn't hesitate to say it was worth every buck. When we arrived at USS, we saw a separate queue that said for VIPs only and wasn't sure if we could use it. However, to our hearts delight the pass was accepted and we zipped past the serpentine queues to get our 'wristbands', including for our kids. This process was followed for almost all the stupendous rides they had, and my spouse concurred upon that it was 'bang for the buck'. I loved the Battlestar Galactica, and felt I signed my own death warrant when I hopped on (took the machine one as the human had a technical fault)- tried to cajole my spouse to take it but of no avail. For some strange reason, the Revenge of the Mummy was also non-operational citing technical issues.We repeated all the rides again thanks to the Unlimited pass we had, and would love to visit this once again.

We had already bought the tickets and express pass and bypassed all the queues entering the park and the rides. Worth the extra money. We did all the thrill rides as soon as we got in. Near some rides they have free lockers for your bags and some rides you cannot have anything in your pockets. They scan you with a metal detector. The lockers are good as they are timed, so you can go on your ride then take your belongings out and then go to the next ride. If you want to have a locker all day you will need to pay for these. Some lockers like the rapids ride didn't have the free lockers so you just need to look around for the free ones near each attraction. The place was so clean and tidy and we had a great day. Expect rain in December so bring a poncho for when this occurs or you can buy them there at $5. On the rapid ride you will need a poncho, there are signs everywhere that you will get wet, but we didn't expect to get so soaked. Shoes, socks, clothing, it was like we went swimming. It was fun and we dried off pretty quickly in the Singapore humidity. It was great. Well worth the effort, but buy tickets in advance together with the express passes

review_449452690,“Superb but tiring - my key do and don't ”,"Went with out five year old and the rides and everything else are awsome and that's a given but some things are also essential to be able to have run and for that you need to know a few things.There is a entry ticket and a express pass which gives you priority in the queue. Comes at a price but if with kids whether you do one ride or two please buy it. With kids you cannot do everything in a day so gear up for a cash burn but pace the day and don't tire yourself out.Walkers and strollers are available at a price and take them. It can get hot go be hydrated as against focussing a lot on eating. Plan the day which is Kid centric or adult centric. If you doing the kiddy things make sure that you a map and are on top of what you want to go and where. There are rides, movies and many other things so planning is key. AGAIN DO NOT TRY TO DO TOO MANY THINGS IN A DAY WITH KIDS IN TOW. be kind to them and hence weather check before going there is essential. The restaurants inside universal studios get crowded so ensure that you go but early and eat. Understand the spread of the park to be able to do justice to it better. There is enough for everyone but given the cost it's best you have a plan and go by it.The express pass for a day is a absolute must.

Head to most popular rides first - the mummy, transformers, and the 2 roller coasters in Sci-fi world. We were travelling with 4 kids (3,5,8,10 yr old) and there's something for everyone - 8 yr old could do almost all rides and he is not tall.Bring own food as pricey.

review_449122507,“Fab Day ”,"Fab day with my partner. I'd forgotten how much I liked a rollercoaster. It doesn't quite have the magic of Florida but we still had a lovely day. I would recommend allowing yourself a day to get round without rushing. The express pass is well worth the money as we went on a Wednesday in low season and the bigger rollercoasters had 45 min queues most of the day. Only bit I found annoying is that you don't get an express band you have to hold onto your print out all day unless you get unlimited by the looks of it. We took the MRT and then the Sentosa shuttle. Highly recommend this as it's so easy and really quick! It drops you right into resort world and its seconds from the bank.

review_449113342,“Good but could be better”,"Got there early which is advised to maximise the day. Some great rides. Loved transformers 3D and some others. Big rollercoaster required you to put everything in a locker which was free for a short time but if you are delayed by the queue you get charged. There is no alternative as they won't let you queue even with a wallet in your back pocket. Cost us $10 to get locker open after being delayed on ride queuing. Got a fast pass after that. I highly recommend getting one as you enter otherwise it could cost more in locker fines over the day. All in all a good day out. Waterworks show was impressive. Water ride also well worth a visit.

review_449053671,“Rides and attractions Galore”,"I went with my wife on the day pass entry, which meant longer waits but less costlier. Very amazing layout. I enjoyed the park setting and atmosphere immensely. I was taken aback by the Jurassic park area and how it made me feel like i was in Isla Nublar. The Jurassic park ride was nice but not the best ride in the park and i'll be honest, only the T-Rex looked realistic. I wished that they had the original Jurassic park t-shirt in grey at the shop and it didn't cost S$35, a more reasonable price would have been S$20. My favourite rides would go to the mummy returns, the transformers 4D ride and battlestar galactica. I was in awe of how superb and realistic the transformer ride was, it was so immersive and as if i was part of the action. The Mummy returns was surprising and theatrical indoor rollercoaster with fire effects and smoke, a truly eerie and terrifying ride with unexpected dips and turns. Battlestar Galactica was a very fast ride, i'll be honest i have been on bigger roller-coasters yet none the less it was a good one.I only tried food in the Madagascar pavillion because it was certified Halal, if you are Muslim please eat from restaurants with the certification only. The Biryani with butter chicken and aaloo gobhi (potato cauliflower) curry was alright but not outstanding. I really wish that universal looks into including more halal restaurants.I would suggest taking raincoats along as the weather is unpredictable and rides close because of rain. The park opens at 10am and closes at 9pm so get there on time. Also don't rely on uber or grab getting you there or collecting you.

It was a really nice park, plenty to see and do. Nice big areas of the streets that are all undercover. We went on the day before New Year's Eve so most of the good rides had a 90minite wait and it was extremely hot, so my husband and 13 yo weren't even willing to wait for that...

review_448851594,“A great day out”,"We had a wonderful day! We decided to not go down the express pass route and were really happy we saved the money. Arrived at opening- went straight to the battlestar galactica ride (5 min queue). This was a good plan as all day this was chocker. The Transformers ride was about a 60 min wait but at the end of the day (after 5.30) there was almost not queue. The Mummy also had very little queue most of the afternoon. The Rapids ride was suspended briefly due to the weather, we decided to try to wait it out and it reopened after about 15 mins. The rides were all good in different ways, loved the shows too. A great day out, that was surprisingly good value for money. Be prepared for sudden downpours and heat, but that doesn't stop the fun. One word of caution.... we tried to book online the night before via the direct USS website (NOT a third party site). When I tried to pay my card would not process, tried again with husband's card, same issue. We were both contacted by the fraud teams at our different banks saying the credit cards have been blocked as ""issues have been raised with that merchant"" (No payment was taken because of this). No idea what that means but would suggest that this route is avoided if you don't want the hassle of your cards being blocked whilst overseas. We ended up paying cash instead.

We had one of our best ever family days out with so many amazing rides and shows. However, buying the Unlimited Express pass was the best decision we made. It meant that we typically waited only a few minutes for any ride and could go on them multiple times versus standard lines that typically had wait times of 60 minutes with some up to 90 minutes. It is an expensive option but worth it on very busy days - particularly with younger children.

Bring camera and plenty of money for snacks, drinks, and other purchases in the stores. Christmas time has special displays and meet Santa (good photo opportunities). One negative side, at busy times the VIP lines can get quite long and cause delays for regular patrons who did not ""pay extra to get let on the rides first"". There were times when there were so many VIP's getting let on that ony a handful of seats remained for those who were queued in the (much longer) non-VIP line. Every time more VIPs would arrive and get priority while the standard queue hardly advanced. Management should look into controlling this. Maybe reserve say a quarter of the seats to VIP and the rest to everybody else, each time the ride runs.

Toddlers; Sesame Street, Madagascar, dinosaurs in the Jurassic area. The first 2 can be scary the first time though. Young kids- the dragon rollercoaster (enchanted castle).

review_448012984,“Needs Harry Potter !! ”,"We have been here twice . Once this week and once before 3 yrs ago. In between we've been to Universal in Florida so have been spoilt a bit by Harry Potter ! Our kids are 13 and 11. One is a complete Rollercoaster addict the other is not ! Our youngest was so pleased he was now big enough to ride the Cylon and the Mummy rides and did so many times thanks to the unlimited fast passes we purchased. As a theme park it's not too expensive to get in but the queues were horrendous (most were 70 to 90mins wait) so we were pleased we made the decision to buy the unlimited fast passes but this bumped the price up by $100 pp so instead of a basic price of $238 it was $638 - quite a commitment but worth it in our opinion. Although it would of been better value with Harry Potter (as in Florida) or a few more medium.thrill rides. They also offer an $80 fast pass which allows one fast pass per ride - the extra $20 for unlimited was essential for us as my two just wanted to go on the same rides again and again.It lost a star for me because of the lack of medium rides ( like Transformers and Jurassic park - the only two) There is a lot for younger children.Practically , it's hot so take hats, sunscreen, be prepared to get wet ( the water world show is great) lots of toilets, lots of food outlets (but mostly chips / burgers mixed with asian fast food) and if you have young kids maybe go later so you can stay up later for the light show ( we started at 10am but were shattered by 5pm because of the heat so didn't make it)

Then we lined up to get on the train and then we lined up to get into universal studios. We decided to get an express pass even though it was (at that time an additional $60 per person), however by the time we got to the front of the line the express pass tickets had gone up to $80!!!! Apparently this happens when they are busy! Anyway even though it was crazy expensive we didn't regret it for a minute most rides had at least a 30mins wait but most had a 100min wait! With the express pass the most we waited was 15 mins. So we went from ride to ride. We had a great day and my 6 year old went on nearly everything. So most rides are aimed at the little ones.

Then i brought him back to our hotel at festive.Later in the evening they said that they had a fireworks attractions at the USS, so i decided to go back in to universal studio.We arrived at around 9.00pm then we shop around til around 9.20-9.25pm then my son saw a santa clause photoshoot at the end of the road, in front of the small universal logo decoration, then he said he wanted to take the picture with the santa,I said ok then. We queue , then after our turn , again the santa bodyguard said sorry its time's up. Santa need to rest or go somewhere else, then my son suddenly ran onto the santa while he (the santa) still sat there but ready to go. My son then hug the santa, i take out my phone and thought it would maybe take a second or two just to press the photo button, but unfortunately its really dissapointing that even the santa moved my son away and said ""sorry, time's up.. got to go"" my son cried like crazy, we were all stunned, what is wrong with them?a santa is supposed to cheer the kids, i know he's a fake santa but come on, at least you have to pretend to be like one.Not some kind of a jerk that make kids dreams go away just because maybe the paycheck in only up to 9.30pm SHARP! This trip to USS is really a nightmare for us. The next dat we brought our son to the shanton clinic at basement of RWS to check on the high fever (not sure its from the heat of the queue or from crying alot when we were at USS the day before)Thanks USS ""staffs"" for making us a really bad day during that trip.Spending so much inside the USS but wasnt happy at all. Stressed out.Hendri

review_447721257,“Get your express pass”,"As always, Universal Studios offers an exciting day out, order and print your tickets online before hand but DON'T FORGET THE EXPRESS PASS. It will save you ages waiting in queues but be realistic when you use them. If its a 10 minute wait just join the line, if you love the ride just go around again.The transformer ride makes me laugh each time, not because its funny but because a middle age bloke isn't supposed to have that much fun, or is he???As I don't like heights and roller coasters I get plenty of opportunities to hold the bags and photo the kids. The faster the ride the keener they are, the hit each coaster a few times each but I manager 3 times on the Transformers, told you its great.The Jurassic ride is fun, just watch what you wear, white or flashy is a risky choice.We find the best value meals are from Friers especially if you can get a seat in the dining hall.We get there at opening and leave when they kick us out.Excellent fun. Just get your express passes.

review_447688083,“Lifetime Experience!!!”,"Everyone was praising so much about this place when I was in Singapore. I thought it's all fake hype before visiting Universal Studios. When I visited this place it blew up our mind. We never had any such experience in our life earlier. Me and my wife had a great time for the whole day. It is a life time experience. We regretted that we did not buy two day pass. My advice is buy 2 day pass so that you can relax and enjoy all the rides without hurry.

I ended up buying a 6 month pass, as we were there for 2 weeks and it meant that we didn't have to try and cram it all in one day during Christmas. It turned out to be the best decision, as we would come in the early morning for a short visit before it got busy, and then return in the evening when it was quiet again! Great place for some fun, and a good selection of rides and attractions for all ages.

review_447656236,“Should definitely be on your to-do list in Singapore!”,"Lovely way to spend your day. You would need a full-day to cover most of the attractions. We went on a weekend and were unable to cover all the rides due to long queues at most of the rides. We covered Transformers- 4D ride (was my personal favorite), Shrek 3D, Rapids at Jurassic Park, Revenge of the Mummy and a few more. Strictly avoid Battlestar Galactica if you aren't too adventurous. If it's rainy, finish the indoor rides first. Don't forget to visit Hollywood and New York zone. The best part of our visit was that we witnessed fireworks, celebrations and artificial snowfall because it was Christmas eve. Overall, an awesome experience.

review_447621049,“Great family day out and totally recommend express unlimited passes”,"Visited the park yesterday with my family and the only disappointment was that having pre-booked our tickets and unlimited express passes we still had to stand in a line for over half an hour at guest services to collect our tickets, there were only 3 staff available and a very long line.That said, once we were in the park it was fantastic and the express passes were well worth the additional cost as the park was very busy and wait times in the normal lines were about 75 minutes, the longest we waited with the express pass was about 15 minutes which meant we could go on our favourite rides many times. The Waterworld show was also very enjoyable.The park itself is very well maintained and extremely clean with a large variety of food and drinks available and plenty of toilets which is always a bonus!! We stayed there for a ful 12 hours and were exhausted by the end of the day but would thoroughly recommend it as an awesome family day out!!

review_447345329,“Superb family day out!”,"We came to USS for Christmas Day and we were not disappointed! Our daughter is 7 so had no restrictions on any of the rides in the park (height restrictions do apply).The park itself is reasonably small, however there is plenty to do in order to keep you occupied for the whole day.There are rides which span all ages, however I would say they USS is less suitable for really small children. The cost to get in is quite expensive, but Singapore in general is quite expensive no matter what you do! With it being December and the rainy season we would advise you take ponchos with you, however these can be purchased for a fee ($4 each when we went).As expected food is quite expensive here (we paid $30 for 3x hotdogs and fries which were very nice, not your normal rubbish) you can't take your own food or drink into the park, and bag checks are carried out before entry.Overall this was an amazing day out and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. We would recommend it to anyone for an enjoyable family day.

Do enquire about it because I realised after entering the park that it would have been a better option.The park takes about 4-5 hours to complete. Refillable water bottles are a good idea. Otherwise food courts are good. It is a good idea to carry swimming costumes with you all over Singapore. Specially for kids.

review_447112615,“AmAzing family day out! ”,"I would honestly suggest you divide universal studios tour into two days to get to play all rides and watch all shows. Alternatively, If you have two age groups you can split into two groups; younger (age 2-5) starts from madgascare and ongoing, the other group starts from Hollywood and on going. I highly recommend buying the express tickets, it's time investment! A queue of 90 minutes will be a 15 minute long! Shows are really nice and you get take photos with characters. December was an amazing time to visit, it was amazingly decorated for Christmas, and Christmas Carlos were playing all the time!

There are many more which are good but these are thrilling. Every moment spent there was worth it.The only con of Universal Studio (which is why I gave a 4 star) is the time. It closes too early and they start asking people to leave. As soon as the clock strikes 6:00 PM, all the rides are shut down.

I expected there to be a few non-Q activities but there are none, so it's either just eat or Q for a ride which got boring after a while. Not recommended if you have kids below 8 as they couldn't stand the 30-60 min waits for the rides. Of course, its worse when we decided to come during a Singapore public holiday - my mistake - which is why I give the benefit of the doubt and give it a 3 star instead of 2.

Queued for about 1.5h for the transformers ride, 20mins for the Mummy ride, 1h++ for the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, 1h for the Puss In Boots and 1.5h for the Enchanted Airways. The Transformers ride was awesome! Definitely worth the queuing time. It was a good experience on the Mummy ride although we visited USS many times but didn't get to try the ride, but it's scary:( Jurassic Park ride was very good. For the Puss in Boots ride, the staffs are like giving so many people in the express lane to go for every 4 turns while the normal lane was like 1 time and then the express one,no wonder the staffs said queuing time is about 85mins for the normal lane. Enchanted Airways too, staffs said queuing time about 35mins but ended up queuing for 1h20mins because the staffs kept giving the express lane! Please, be fair to the people queuing in the normal lane too, like every 2 turns give to the normal lane while every 2 turns give to the express lane, not every 4 turns give to the express lane while every 1 turn give to the normal lane. Waterworks show was fantastic. And what? Queued 30mins for the 4D show? Definitely do not worth it. I don't know if the park is open everyday until 10.30pm or some days, yesterday the fireworks display was at 10.30pm. I went to a light room(I don't know what's the name, but it's inside the park) It was so beautiful! Took so many photos there. Feeling high in Christmas mood. The light room I think it is supposed to be only for Christmas. Overall a very good day.

As that show ended, I approached the personnel who were very willing to help but couldn't really do anything about it. I have also reported it to the guest service. It's just hard to believe that a theme park at the caliber of US would be so unsafe. I wrote this within 3 hours of losing my camera bag.

review_446184590,"“Enjoy Universal Studios or not, Staffs Customer Service Standard Important!”","Decided to try for annual pass application, but was confused by the explantation on the staffs outside RWS invite counter. One was news that just want to get the sale& membership sign up, one was unporfessional , even throw the calculator in front of us and show how the fees was pay. very bad experience from the start. Suppose to give 1 Star ranking (Terrible) for this review, fortunate RWS USS still got good staff like Edieusdi , who take time to explain to us , what the best deal about various annual pass , and why apply for express it is more worth it etc. So we give addition 1 more star for this Review. Theme park is as wonderful as usual, the Guinness World Record and various new Christmas Theme in the park worth our time visit. So well done to those who design these. however, do remember, even you got a outstanding theme park, but the customer service was lousy , the overall experience will still be below average.

review_446045497,“Battlestar Galactica is a MUST go!”,"First of all, the place was quite small compared to Universal Studios in another country. There was not much ride for adults, the only fun rides for me are the Battlestar Galactica, Cyclone, Transformers, and Mummy. There are long queues in every ride, we had to wait for a good few hours to ride the Battlestar Galactica! Advice: go for that ride first when you reach there or wait till night time when most of the ""tour"" crowds are gone. I did not get to visit some of the areas (Madagascar, Far Far Away & New York) due to time wasted when queuing for the rides in Sci-Fi City, Ancient Egypt and Lost World. I also didnt get to watch any of the shows because I was queuing for the ridesStay till the night to watch the fireworks! Its worth it! Recommed to go earlier before the fireworks starts to get a good view.

review_446038701,"“Good attractions and ambience, but beware of long waiting time”","The attractions and rides are fine, and the ambience of the park good (except for loud music in places). However, it was impossible to enjoy the park without purchasing the additional express ticket (at 60 SGD) per ticket, as all the more popular rides had waiting times of around 50 minutes. We would have spent most of the day queuing for hours for two minute rides. This made for a very expensive day at the park. More rides or limit the number of guests.

review_446033705,“Single rider privilege”,"We frequently visit Universal studio in Singapore because it is my son favorite theme park. The theme park is very attractive and numerous people line up for different games. I do not like to waste my time to line up so I get up early in the morning.   My son prefers to use money for souvenirs rather than buying the fast pass. Therefore, he saves money but sometimes he will miss some fun~fair. This do not matter because we will come back in future. In the past, we used most of the time to play transformer again and again . This time we use the privilege of singe rider to play transformer 3 times within 1 hour. Therefore we have plenty of time for shopping. I highly recommend that family members should take the ride using single rider privilege. It is better than the fast pass.

review_446009797,“Pleasantly surprised--AND USE THE SINGLE RIDER OPTION”,"Based on my prior research, I was prepared to be underwhelmed. This place is small for a high end amusement park; it has fewer attractions than other universal parks; and it can be quite crowded. With that said, I had a GREAT day here. It was just right for a one-day excursion into the fantasy of the movies. I even think the park has more ambiance than the Universal in Orlando. We went on a weekday and got there before the gates opened. This allowed us to do some big ticket attractions before they got too busy. My advice is to do the two Battlestar Galactica roller coasters first (the Cylon is a bit more intense) as they get long lines that last all day, and there is no single rider option. After those, try the Transformers ride. This was my favorite attraction. Here is an IMPORTANT tip for the rest of the day-- USE THE SINGLE RIDER LINE at the attractions if you are there on a busy day. Don't waste your money on the overpriced special pass that gets you ahead in line. By using the single rider line, we never waited more than 10 minutes to get on a ride, and most of our waits were less. You'll have the same thrill, even if you are sitting next to a stranger, and you might even make a friend! We went to the Transformers ride when it had an 80-minute wait for the normal line, and the single rider option got us on in less than 10. Several attractions like the Jurassic Park raft ride don't advertise a single rider option. Just ask the attendant at the ride entrance, and they will tell you if single riders are allowed as well as the estimated wait. Regarding food, there is a food court not far outside the entrance to the park. Fast food prices are a bit lower out there.

review_445811919,“Great family fun”,"We went as a family on Sunday and also during school holidays. We purchase the Universal Express as we expected a large crowd.We booked online and had our tickets printed before hand. Arrived at Harbourfront MRT and walked to USS via the boardwalk. It was good that the walkway was covered as it rained that day.Few notes on Universal Express:1. Not all rides have express lane - one in particular is the Canopy Flyer.2. We bought the Universal Express online and pre-printed ours - we realise that the pass is not tagged to the individual. As such, we can share the pass. 3. If you are not constraint for time, most of the rides including transformers, human, cyclon has waiting time of 10mins to 20 mins after 8pm.Overall, it was great fun and a fairy tale experience for the young ones.

review_445739616,"“Great Day on Great Rides! Great Time, even though it cost a bit more!”","I have been to Universal Studios Singapore (USS) twice before. 1st time for a corporate event, 2nd time, just a normal visitor. The 2nd visit, I was disheartened by the long queues at each ride and really didn't enjoy myself as the long queues meant I only managed to catch very few rides. After a few years, yesterday, a friend and I decided to make it a day at USS. This time, we spurged on the Universal Express Unlimited Pass. This is in addition to the Single Admission Ticket and what the Universal Express does is that it allows the holder to enter each ride through an Express queue line which is usually empty. And the Unlimited part of it allows you to take the ride as often as you like. Believe me when I say, this Universal Express is a great expenditure if you really want to enjoy the theme park.On the theme park itself, there are 7 zones. These are New York, Sci-Fi City, Ancient Egypt, The Lost World, Far Far Away, Madagascar and Hollywood. The Battlestar Galactica rides were awesome, so were the 3D rides all over the other zones, though I felt some of the 3D images were 'getting fuzzy'.Being an enclosed theme park, the food and drinks sold inside are rather pricey, when you can compared with alternatives available in Singapore. As the theme park does not allow you to bring food from elsewhere, do bring your own drinking water and you can top up drinking water at drinking fountains inside the park.USS is situation in the equatorial region. Hence it is hot and humid inside the park. Wear comfortable dry fit tee, shorts and running shoes. It is the only way to beat the heat in there.And to maximise your time in the park, plan your time to catch the shows in between the rides. With the Universal Express pass, my friend and I were able to do 90% of the rides (we skipped the very kiddy rides) and some of the shows.Don't miss the Waterworld show, though aged, still thrills with their stunts and pyrotechnics! The other stage shows were just a fun to watch.As it turn dark, the lightup of USS is pretty nice and I found out that on Saturday nights, were will be a short firework show which I missed.Overall, USS is a pricey experience but a nicely appropirated theme park in Singapore.For those you are living in Singapore, I learned that there are half yearly membership, which cost only a small fraction above the price of a single admission ticket.For family with kids, the membership make sense as you can bring the family back to USS as often as you want and cover one or two zones extensively during each visit.Last Note. There are free lockers for Battlestar Galatica rides. Please put everything in the lockers before you take the ride as they will turn you back if you have your wallet or handphone with you. For the Wet Rides, there are lockers that cost S$4 per hour to rent and ponchos for S$4 each. Go bring your own zip lock bags and ponchos before these rides. And even if you get wet, the hot weather will dry you up pretty quickly if you are wearing a dry fit tee.

This will be a tour that ensure you will not miss a single thing in the park and leave with no regrets.

Such an amazing day to be had by all, just remember that during holidays this place is so busy the waits in cues are long so I would recommend purchasing the VIP express tickets which get you in everywhere so much quicker which makes the experience such a wonderful one, and if your a solo traveller or a couple. Using the Solo traveller line is the best way to also get onto the rides without having to wait as long, we found we got onto the transformers ride without any wait while groups were waiting 30 minutes or more.

Carry water and refill, as buying water in the park is quite expensive.5) Dress for comfort, and not style. Have a great visit to the park.

review_445577379,“Best experience in Singapore - do not miss!”,"Was in Singapore for a week, and saw pretty much every major attraction. US Singapore is the #1 experience in Singapore hands down. Loads of activities for all ages, for adults, I would suggest going for the Mummy, galactica and Transformers rides. Also, the $67 tickets are quite reasonable. The express pass is too expensive however ($50), it would be more affordable if it cost $25-30.Tips: Avoid weekends/holidays (It took me 1.5 hours in queue to ride Battlestar Galactica!) and reach the place early - it gets really crowded in the afternoon and you will face long lines. Complete the best attractions (rides) as early as possible and spend the rest of the time on the shows etc which have shorter lines.

Also from a kids perspective it is not too sprawling and is therefore easy to cover in a day.The usual 'time to ride' indicators were useful as ever to guide you on how long you would be queuing.

My daughter once lost her cap after riding Shrek's dragon-coaster and we were still able to contact USS admin. via e-mail inquiries and retrieved the cap (thanks in part to my friend who got it from the park and mailed it back) - these little things are what make us come back for more.

Don't waste time with the Human version. Because there is usually a long waiting time for these rides, be prepared to queue at least an hour or so. If you have some extra cash to spare, just go for the express pass.A good tip is to buy the tickets online to avoid the queue. Also, if you happen to be in Singapore during October, they have the Halloween Horror Nights which is my favourite event there.

Weekends is just crowded especially during the region school holidays.** For Muslims, not all the restaurants serve halal food. You have to ask to find out which one. We always dine at Mel's Diners - with Halal certification.** BUY the EXPRESS PASS to cut queue especially on the famous rides. You wont regret it.** If your child loves to go on an interesting rides over and over again, then BUY the UNLIMITED EXPRESS pass....the child can go on the rides using the express lane as many times as he/she wants.** If not, on Battlestar Galactica CYCLON ride for example, the time difference is 15 mins waiting time for Express and 60 mins waiting time for the normal queue. I took note of this during our weekend trip.We have an Annual Pass with Unlimited Express Pass. The breakeven number of visits to Universal Studio Singapore is 2 times. The 3rd and onwards visit can be considered as a free visit.

review_444974143,“Amazing Place”,"This is a fantastic place, all the rides we rode were awesome. It's a nice big place, very nicely orchestrated. Toilets are everywhere which is very helpful. Food inside the studio were also reasonable priced. It is very highly recommended to buy the universal express pass, that basically saved us hours waiting in line. Even though the price for the universe express pass is a bit steep, but the money spent is really well worth for the time saved. Nice place with couple or family. It's a must if visiting Singapore.Will surely visit again.

review_444970707,“Small but fun!”,"Was here on a Sunday. The crowd seem ok and no need to queue very long for rides without express pass. Overall quite happy with it and you don't really need a day at the park. But will be hard if you wanted to wait for the evening parade. So maybe you can spend sometime in cafe or eatery.

review_444950951,“An enjoyable day at USS”,"It was a Friday and queues of about 30 people each were already formed up at the four turnstiles. When the park was promptly opened at 10 am, people were seen running in, presumably targeting the Human and Cyclon roller coasters and Transformer rides. My family however chose to head in the other direction, towards Madagascar and Far Far Away zones. There were hardly anyone in these 2 zones, and we could take the rides without any wait time. We came back in the evening at about 7 pm and we were able to take Human (15 minute wait) and Transformer (5 minute wait) rides fairly quickly.Here're the rides we took and our rating:Madagascar Zone: Madagascar: A Crate Adventure (1 out of 5) - Young ones would enjoy this, but pace too slow for adults.Far Far Away Zone:Enchanted Airways (4 out of 5) - A thrilling but short roller coaster. Kids will love this.Shrek 4-D Adventure (4 out of 5) - This is our 3rd experience and it is still a good show!Puss In Boots’ Giant Journey (4 out of 5) - Interesting ride that starts with soaring up a tower.Ancient Egypt:Revenge of the Mummy (4 out of 5) - Thrilling and scary ride that is not for the faint-hearted Good spooks!The Lost World (Opens at 11 am):Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (3.5 out of 5) - You have a 50% chance of getting your feet soaked. The ending is a sudden plunge!Waterworld (4 out of 5) - Great stunt performance with lots of laughs at the beginning. Go 15 minutes earlier before showtime to get a good spot.New York:Lights, Camera, Action!™ Hosted by Steven Spielberg (4 out of 5) - Great storm effectsSesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase (2 out of 5) - More for young kids.Sci-Fi City:Human (5 out of 5) - One of the best roller coasters I ever rode in, Fast with hardly any chance to catch a breath.Transformers (5 out of 5) - The effects are so real that you feel as if you are really in the thick of the action.Santa's All Stars Christmas (1 December 2016 to 2 January 2017)Live show “Bah Humbug! A Christmas Spectacular” (5 out of 5) - An entertaining musical show hosted by Little Match Girl and Scrooge featuring Sesame Street characters, Minions, and others. The singing and dancing were of good quality.Illuminate the Season with Christmas Cheer! (3 out of 5) - Great for taking pictures.Santa's Village (3 out of 5) - Visit if you have young ones below 10.

review_444824355,“Smallest Universal but still a good place to have fun.”,"The Universal Studios in Singapore is the smallest theme park i've ever visited. I rated this theme park terrible because, Elmo is for Toddlers and i find it very absurd that a two year old cannot ride elmo due to its height restriction! We visited Disneyland and ride on the Peter Pan and they didn't apply height restriction as ride wise it is exactly the same as Elmo's Spaghetti SpaceChase. I guess for a group that think of themselves as smart is not at all smart as they haven't thought of this matter!

review_444600265,“Go late afternoon to avoid crowds and heat! ”,"If I can give any advise for Universal Studios - Singapore it would be to wait until late afternoon to go! We went on a Monday to avoid the busy crowds that come with weekends, however we got there 10:30am and it was still packed!! We decided as entry was $74 that we weren't going to buy the express but after we waited ONE AND A HALF HOURS to get onto a water ride we decided to get it. The express pass is pricy! $50 will get you express access to every ride once, and $70 gives you unlimited express to every ride. We decided to go the $70 and really regretted it at the end of the day. Reason is because come 3-4 o'clock the place was dead! And we didn't need to even use the express pass as we could just walk onto the rides. So my advice would be to come late afternoon, wonder around, take your day pictures, go to the shows and then later at night go on the rides! It's much cooler (weather wise) as well as riding the rides at night adds a different element. We had an absolute ball and highly recommending coming to Universal.

review_444557685,“Fun for kids”,"We went with our 3 & 5yrs old on a Monday from 12.30pm to 8.30pm. Operating hours had been extended to 9pm in December for the Christmas activities. It was quite crowded with queues up to an hour, probably due to local school holidays & USS Christmas activities.We went on the following rides suitable for our kids:-Treasure Hunters jeep ride (50mins Q)-Dino-soarin(40mins Q)-Shrek 4D (15mins Q)-Magic Potion Spin (No Q)-Madagascar Boat ride (15mins Q)-King Julian Beach Party Go -Round carousel (5mins Q)-Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase (20mins Q)The queue areas are mostly sheltered and there are water coolers inside for those who are thirsty or need to top up their water bottles. We went to the Santa Village & Light up for photo taking too. It's nicely done up but doesn't justify the ""after 5pm admission bundle ticket"" price for it, unless you are planning to go to SEA Aquarium or Cove Waterpark before that. Best to buy a full day ticket because most rides close by 830pm. Food & drinks aren't very expensive. Tastes ok too. A big slice of pizza costs $11, kid's meal $10, small sundae $4.50, pasta with chicken $14. Collectable water bottle with soft drink range from $10~$28, refills at $2. With 2 meal/rest breaks in between, we had no time for other rides. Didn't catch any performances as well. Neither did we go for any Meet & Greet sessions because we were at the rides. There's a lot of walking, mostly without shelter. Strollers available for rent at $15 single seat, $20 double seat. Stroller parking available outside every ride. Not many sheltered rest areas. Most are part of the eateries. On the whole we had fun and wished we had time & energy for more. If you think you have time to come back again in the next 6~12mths, do upgrade to a season pass (valid 6mths) or annual pass from $24~. The queue to upgrade the pass is quite long. We waited for 40mins even though there were less than 10pax in the queue at 8pm. Do allocate enough time for it.

review_444393968,“Fun Filled Day!!”,"Universal Studios, Singapore is a theme adventure park located on Sentosa island.To begin with, Sentosa Island is theme park having multiple attractions like Universal Studios/ Seaquarium/ Kidzania etc. However, Universal Studios itself requires one complete day and further you will not be able to do all rides/ attractions in a single day.I went to the USS (Universal Studios Singapore) with my husband. The ticket/ day pass costs around 75-84 SDG/person (rates vary on different promotional schemes) and premium pass costs around 25 SDG more. Once you have an entry to USS, any ride can be availed any no. of times without any additional cost. There are separate entry gates for basic pass holders and premium pass holders, so that less waiting time for premium pass holders; however it is wastage, because normally waiting time for rides is approx 5-20 min only.Tips:1. Reach in time i.e. by 10 AM. It opens at 10.00 and closes by 07:00 PM.2. If ticket has been booked in advance through some travel agency/ hotel, then pls ensure that you carry the right ticket. Actually, in singapore, small size tickets are given, all having a unique barcode and picture advertisement of some attraction, which leads to confusion that which ticket is applicable for which attraction.3. Carry a water bottle. Water points are available at all attractions. Else, buying water everytime not only cost money but time as well.4. The USS has circular in shape. Major parts are : a) Far Far Away Land : Has attractions/ rides /shops/Meet & greet with characters mainly for children such as Shrek/ Fiona , Sesame Street, Minion, Puss in Boots etcb) Mummy Area: Attractions and rides such as Revenge of Mummy, some merry go-round etcc) Lost world: Jurassic park rides/ dinosaur ridesd) Hollywood: Movies, light camera action, shows etce) New York:f) Sci fi city: Terminators/ robots/ rides etc.5. Following rides are must for any adventure loving person. Pls ensure that you do not miss following rides/ attractions:a. Terminator- 4D rideb. Revenge of mummy: wonderful/thrilling ridec. Puss in the boots: Anti-gravity rided. Dinosaur: Lost world ridee. Hollywood: Lights Camera & Actionf. Far Far Away Land:4-D movieIf you want adrenaline rush, then rides such as cyclone/galactica are also advised. We did not do these, rather did some wonderful rides twice.6. When you enter, put hand on a map, so that you can decide which rides to do and how to plan them. Because there are some attractions which are like show/movie and have fixed time slot. Ensure that you are available at that time. Also, if you want to have your photos clicked with characters then they also have fixed Meet n Greet slots.7. When you enter USS, it feels like wow. And we start clicking photos. I would suggest, then when enter have your photos clicked with each attraction so that you look fresh in the photos. else by the end of the day, weariness appears on the face. But still do not waste your time in photos, rather enjoy rides. Also, it is noticed that mostly people do not take rides in second half as they get busy in lunch/ take rest. In second half the waiting time reduces tremendously. Use this golden time to do your favourite rides again.8. Wear very comfortable shoes/sneakers/sandals as you have to walk a lot.9. Lastly, choose a working day/ non-holiday to visit to avoid rush.Hope, I have covered all points, but still you can leave a Message for any confusion. Have a great time.

You can choose 3 ways to come here from vivo city mall, by skytrain, cable car, or walk. I chose walk, cheaper and you can enjoy the sea. Visit the most interesting attraction first. I chose transformer. If you come during the weekend, they have fireworks party in the night.

After this they went up to 60-80 minutes, so I recommend going a little earlier for a couple hours of short ride queues. We did several character meet and greets, all the attractions, and some shows. Definitely worth watching the water world show its very good! But be warned they don't joke when it says ""soak zone"" I literally walked out dripping wet but it was good fun. Food is a little expensive, we bought a snack through the day but took our own lunch and water bottles and filled them up via the water fountains onsite. Rides are good fun, on a small scale for Universal but still a good full day of attractions we spent 6 hours here!

review_444243989,“Good place to visit”,"I visited today (Wednesday) with my friend, and I was so afraid that we will need the express unlimited pass, but actually, we didn't need it, we'll only once we had to wait 40 mins in the queue and while waiting I was thinking ""why I didn't get the pass"" but only in that particular time we had to wait that long, in the busiest one we spend in average 20 mins, in the non busy one, sometimes less than 5, so if you go during the week, don't bother about the pass. Without the pass we managed to do all the ""grown up"" attractions plus the waterfront show, plus the theatre show, plus transformers (2 extra times), human (2 extra times), the mummies (1 extra time) and cyclon (4 extra times) and we only arrived there at midday. Another tip, food is expensive inside, and in our case (and according to some friends too) they don't check your bags. We brought biscuits and crisps, if I knew they wouldn't check I would have taken my Tupperware full of food. However, don't stress! A good tip is to leave the park and visit the Malaysian street market (which is opposite the entrance) food in there is cheaper and nicer. You can leave the park and get and stamp to get back in. The park closed at 21.00, and I promise you, we visited more attractions from 19.00 to the end than from the moment we arrived. The reason is that families take theirs kids home early, so less people towards the end of the day. We finished with the human ride, and we had the entire car for ourselves (we got into the ride at about 20.57)Ah, another tip, pay with MasterCard and you get 10% discount plus a free bottle gift. You can buy online and get your tickets at the counter in there if you don't have a printer. Cheerios!

The breakfast with Sesame Street was a blast for our 4 year old daughter. It was amazing experience to see Elmo and Friends were become ""real"" and accompany her bfast at Louis Pizza. The day was fun but since it was Saturday long queue everywhere, but you can pay extra SGD 50 to purchase express lane if you want to skip the long queue and have more time to enjoy all the rides. Photo booth traps in many spots, they took the photo of you and if you're interested to take the photos they will charge you from SGD 25 to 30 for each photo. So expensive, I feel robbed! But it was optional though you can also say thanks and walk away not to take your photos that were taken. Overall it was a fun day but extremely tired to walk around the whole area. Just prepare your legs and your pocket for more exciting experiences and buy more gifts.

This is very surprise to us, because to get express tickets are not cheap. and for the First family, we got free photo with puss in boots from dark room photographand it looks like the day it became one of the most enjoyable day for our family.USS One of the best entertainment we have ever visited. the place is spacious and clean. uss also provide stroller for rent so that we no longer need to carry the stroller from the hotel.There are seven areas in uss: Hollywood, New York, Sci Fi City, Ancient Egypt, Jurrasic park, Far Far away and madagascar.In Hollywood we could see the atmosphere of old hollywood, form the house and shop, even we can meet with Marilyn Monroe if lucky.In NY we could see the town where there is figure sesame street and children very glad to meet elmo an friends and sesame street at Spaghetti space.Then we get to the Sci Fi City, there is a roller coaster that seemed incredible exciting, because I did not dare to ride both of them so we only play under the galactica while father riding Battlestar Galactica. there is also adventure transformers 3d, to me Transformer is one of the best rides in the uss. 3d remarkable performances so makes the children were stunned and felt that we were actually going to be in combat robot.We passed Ancient egypt because children are less familiar with The Mumy.Afterwards there Jurrasic park, in Jurassic dino children can only ride Dino Soarin, Pteranodon that can fly. it was quite entertaining themThen there Far Far away, adventure Puss in Boots is quite interesting to make a roller coaster so enjoyable. as well as shrek 4d event, children enjoyed the event because it can feel the water splashing, attack from spider, etc.magadaskar is the last, there are King Julien's beach party go round, children like this. and lastly there crate adventure, we will board the boat and into the adventure in madagascar.there are some rides that can not be ridden by children under 5 years old because they were not high enough, but it does not make children sad, because there are many interesting gameseach area provided so much food and drink that can be bought so children do not feel hunger and thirst.so yes i can say, uss is one of the best theme park in Asia

review_442981761,“Best Theme Park in South East Asia”,"In my opinion, most of the rides are suitable for kids above 7 yo and, I should say, for the whole family. The rides are great & the performances are world class. Try to purchase your tickets earlier and plan your visit during off-peak.The park has many section and it's not too expose to sunlight. However, sunscreen still needed. Also, you can just bring along a small water bottle as sufficient amount of water dispensers are provided throughout the park. Bring along a disposable rain coat as you will need one when you take the Jurassic Park water ride. No worry if you can't find one as the park does sell it at SGD4 per piece. The park closes at 6pm and if you want to avoid long queue to get out of the island, try to leave before 6pm.

review_442897920,“Superbly done!”,"I visited this place with my wife (she was not very keen, but she is now happy she took my word)As any other place in Singapore, this place is well organised and very convenient.Please carry your own bottle of (and for) water, as water for sale, like any other eatable drinkable item is very expensive. There are water outlets for visitors everywhere. So you can take a sip for free and also refill your bottle.The best rides - Transformers 4d and Return of the mummies.

Our average ride wait time was 10-15 minutes ( but we didn't go on the roller coaster rides).The Waterworld Show was very entertaining and worth seeing.My favourite ride was the water ride in the Jurassic Park area. We got very wet but it was worth it. If you are wearing runners, you should take a spare set of dry socks to wear afterwards. Our clothes dried quickly but our runners and socks felt damp for hours afterwards.The Steven Spielberg sound Show is worth seeing as well.Overall, a great visit.

review_442541065,“Great rides! ”,"This theme park is not exactly huge, but have plenty of rides to enjoy. Especially if you are a roller-coaster and water splashing ride enthusiast. My favorite is the Transformer ride located in the sci-fi zone. It is not a roller coaster, but it feels like one. It uses 3D movie, wind, water spray, and your air to give amazing immersion. Besides who doesn't like robots that talks and blow things up!! Best best!! I also extremely enjoyed the Shrek (did I spell that green ogre's name correctly?) 4D show.. Watch your neck but things really came towards you :-) The excellent live stunt of water world also not to be missed. And of course the Jurassic Park adventure.. For which you might want to wear a poncho if you really don't like being wet.. But they provide a body dryer after the ride where the whole family can cuddle and get blasted a hot air... Or like me, take the short ride of canopy flyer and you will be dry by the time you are back on solid ground again. A full one day is needed for i-dont-have-time traveller, and two days visit for i-want-to-properly-enjoy-this travellers. I did the first one and now I'm sitting at Changi trying to loose the sore feet and thigh.

review_442489390,“Fun day out”,"Got to go on all the rides with the express pass so highly recommend it if it's too busy which you can find out after you enter the park and purchase within the park. There are 2 options, the standard express which allows you to use the express queue once for each ride which was the one I got for $50SGD and the upgraded express one which allows you to use the queue unlimited times which is like about $70SGD. I booked the tickets beforehand but there is no need as you can purchase at the gate.Highlight for me was the transformers ride it was an epic 4D visual experience combined with the rollercoaster type feel to it as well. The twin coasters was also a thrilling highlight as well as the egyptian rollercoaster which is in pitch black.

review_441634713,“Santa's All-Star Christmas - extended opening hours”,"USS is celebrating their Christmas event and it would be a good time to visit due to their extended opening hours (10am - 9pm on weeknights, till 10pm on weekends). The park is also beautifully lit and decorated with some special experiences.Don't miss:- “Bah Humbug! A Christmas Spectacular” @ The PantagesLive show with dance and music and even a very cool acrobat performance. Watch out for the inflatable balls they release at the end of the show! - Santa's Village Easy to mistaken as just another park decoration as it looks like a big lit up Christmas tree. The tunnel leads to Santa's Village, it's a bit wild in there. Kids will love it, and if you love taking photos, don't miss it.- Minions capsules 12 for $10Probably the best buy at the park if you are looking for a cheap-ish souvenir to bring back. The capsules contain a variety of bric-bracs like keychains and snap bracelets.In terms of festive food, noticeably lesser than last year (they weren't very good anyways). We purchased a collectible Santa cup that was filled with enough froyo for a small family from Star Dots. Cup is of nice quality. The one at Mel's Diner comes with banana flavoured soft serve and I think a different one is sold at the cart outside Casa Del Wild.With the extended opening hours, you should be able to manage without an Express Pass. Birthday Month OfferingsAs it was my son's birthday month, we went ahead to claim his birthday entitlements. He received a Minion capsule, a popcorn voucher (small cup) and a 15% discount voucher at KT's Grill or merchandise.

We bought the single use express pass but also arrived early to beat the queues (i.e. Lined up regularly in the morning when there was no wait for the roller coasters and then used the express pass later when the lines were longer - were talking over an hour wait for the roller coasters).For both adults we paid $250 for express pass on top. Pay a bit more you can have unlimited express pass. After riding each ride once or twice the novelty wears off so I'd recommend just the single use express pass.Highly recommend seeing the waterworks show.Food/drink are very overinflated inside for poor quality food. We got a pass out for lunch and ate at the very cheap and delicious Malaysian street food hall (completely stuffed full for $6 each).

review_441272595,“Fun for a day”,"Visited the Universal Studios park yesterday and had a great time. A good time to visit this attraction is definitely on a weekday as it's a lot less crowded than on weekends. When visiting the park do note that certain rides will have longer waiting times than others. For example, the Battlestar ride's waiting time was between 40-70 minutes whereas the Mummy ride's waiting time was 5 minutes. This is mainly because the Battlestar ride is a two seater whereas the Mummy is a four seater so make sure to plan which rides you want to go to first. With the introduction of the new Puss-In-Boots ride we were pleasantly surprised to find a good new ride that's suitable for families and yet still provides the thrill of a rollercoaster. The food and drinks at the park are overpriced but this is to be expected so do bring your own water bottle which you can fill up using the water coolers available all over the park. When going to the park make sure to wear comfortable and light clothes (I'd advise against dresses and skirts) and when choosing shoes to wear do note that if you wear slippers you may be required to put them in cubbyholes for certain rides (Also do note that if you want to go on the Jurrasic park rapids adventure ride you are probably going to get wet so do buy/bring a raincoat or have a change of clothes with you as there are drying stations outside the ride but you might have to pay. If you're wearing sneakers/covered shoes these might get wet during the ride so be careful!)

review_441268724,“Small theme park that has seen better days.”,"Universal Studios Singapore (USS) was launched in March 2010, and it is 6+ years old. You can see the aging theme park, and the upkeep of some of the attractions were not done well. For example, the Treasure Hunters motor car ride was dismal. The fake crocodiles in the ponds were so covered with algae and also discolored, it showed how much upkeep was put into it. The mummy ride also had technical errors.I went during a school holiday but the park was not crowded at all, a far cry from a few years back. The good thing was that you get to the rides faster, but I think it reflects the state of USS now. Quite a number of the USS crew looked bored and disinterested in what they were doing. USS has seen better days.This is a small theme park, and one day is ample time to spend at the park. You can exit and re-enter the park if you wish to go outside the park to get something else to eat.

review_440775025,“How to get the cheapest ticket and when to go”,"The cheapest way to buy the ticket is Klook. You will find most sites selling expensive trips with 1 way transport etc. However the cheapest way is to buy online and go by taxi. The trip advisor is full of advise for avoiding the weekend. It is the best advise. We went on Monday after waiting many days in Singapore although the gut is to do this first but we followed advise of others. There is little crowd and very little at 10AM when it opens.There are just 1 big show (Waterworld) and a few big rides. Here is my suggestion to do everything in quick time with minimal walking - 1. Reach at 930AM and be in line. Start with Transformers ride (go right), 2. Then go to Mummy ride (at Egypt), 3. Then the Galactica (at Sci fi zone) if you can do the big rides.4. Wait outside Jussasic park (after Sci fi zone) as it opens at 11 and do the water ride on the right (at 4PM there was 1.5hr wait and at my schedule you will be in the first few tugs). 5. Do Waterword at 11456. Do Airways in Far Far world and Pussy in BootsWith this you are basically done. Rest all are small shows for kids - Donkey, When I grow Up PLUS Steven Spielburg.Follow the above tip and you are done for the day with many hours to spare for repeats.

The longest we had to line up for a ride was about 50 mins. I don't think the priority pass is worth it unless you are there on a weekend. Good vibe and lockers available for your gear near the big rides. Best rides were the Mummy and Battlestar Galactica.

In Singapore make sure you have an umbrella, it rains pretty much every day. Make sure you have your own rain suits or ponchos prior entry, you can get cheaper ones at Daiso in Vivo city mall before boarding Sentosa express.My Son was 8 and he did enjoy the rides.To avoid the rush choose a weekday and a school working day.Do not miss the Shrek, Transformers ride, Steven Spielberg show (Light,sound and action) and for the daredevils the amazing coasters.Kids do enjoy the road shows and dance along routines.Check the schedule and don't miss the Water World show , amazing presentation.Wide choice of food inside, for cheaper options check out the Malay street foods.

review_440539952,“A great place and an amazing theme park”,"This is definitely a must visit place in Singapore. The Universal Studios is a beautifully designed theme park with plenty of thrilling rides. You would definitely need a complete day to enjoy the whole of Universal Studios. The Universal Studios is divided into 5 different zones like Jurassic Park, Hollywood, etc and each of the zones have there own set of thrilling rides. Some of the most amazing rides in the Universal Studios are the Jurassic Park adventure ride, the roller coaster, the Transformers, the Shreik, etc. There are also many restaurants in the Universal Studios to enjoy the variety of Foods that Singapore has to offer. The park is very crowded and there are long queues in each ride and so if possible one can buy the express pass which will let you bypass the queue and enjoy the rides without waiting.

There were so many people with express tickets (they go straight to front) and so many ""single riders"" who also queue jump that it wasn't funny! Would have hated to have young kids with me. There were so many additional charges for Madame Tussaud's etc that was off putting as it was costly enough for a universal studio/aquarium/cable car ticket. The rides and the place were good but when we got off the cable car we found ourselves confused as to where we were going. Lack of signposts as you get off the cable car.Would not rush back. Costly and frustrating day.

And there are so many places at reasonable prices to eat at.Must go on the Wild River Boat Ride, it's so much fun & you will get wet.Transformers to truly fantastic!!. Loved it first time there so knew this time to expect to be screaming now & then. Seems so real. Great settings so much to do & enjoy...get there early as it doesn't take long to have to expect maybe 20 minutes in a queue waiting to enjoy a ride.It's possible to buy a ""beat the queue"" at the entry when purchasing admission tickets, bit expensive BUT to walk pass all the people lined up & waiting can make the cost well worthwhile.A visit to Universal Studios when visiting Singapore is a MUST

Will it stop me from coming here again? NO! Even if limited, the park offers a glimpse and fun of a Universal Studios. They have The Mummy and Jurassic park ride which is a must. Plus a Transformers ride/attraction. How to get there: From Vivo city, take the tram to the first station. TIp: you may use your EZ Card but not the Tourist pass one. Over-all, I will still visit. In fact I hit myself a season pass. I just wish they would have Harry Potter village/attractions.

If you are visiting during the weekend, then I would advise to get there early and do both Battlestar Galactica rides first before anything else, as you will save a lot of time queueing. Revenge of the Mummy: the Ride and the Transformer ride are also very much worth doing and the queues seemed to be a lot shorter for those two rides. You can buy your USS ticket along with the monorail ticket at the Waterfront station, if you choose to get there by using the Sentosa Express. USS is well worth a visit!

review_440286289,“Fun and Exciting”,"This is my first time in singapore and I went to USS with two of my friends. We came in the morning and play from 10 am to 6 pm.There are many exciting attractions and stage show. I recommend the universal express ticket so you can skip the regular queue or just go for the single rider queue line. You might be separated from your party during the ride, but you can save a lot of time by avoiding the regular queue.For lunch, we went to Mel's Drive-In. Its a fast food joint, and if you are lucky, you can eat while watching the waiters sing and dance (Mel's Dinettes)!My recommendations:1. I love Transformers The Ride the most! Its a 3D ride in a 16-people boat and we have to use a 3D googles to join the battles with Optimus Prime and Bumblebee! I love how there are background stories in every attractions in USS.2. The next one I'd like to recommend is Revenge of the Mummy. Its a roller coaster, so you have to store your belongings in a complimentary locker (all loose articles are prohibited during the ride). The ride is dark and exciting with a lot of sudden dropping and accelerations. But you won't know what will hit you because its dark down there.3. If you love roller coaster so much then go for the Battlestar Galactica! Unfortunately, I only get to ride the Human one because of bad weather, but the ride is still exciting nonetheless. The Cylon version is more extreme and I'm sure it will be much more exciting!I recommend you to ride all the top attractions in USS. If you ever watch the water world, please do seat in the front row for more exciting experience. Beware though you will definitely be soaking wet! You can also go for the Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure. You do not have to store your belongings in a locker (we have to pay $4 for this locker), but please note that your belongings will be wet during the ride. Another note: if you ever watch the Lights, Camera, Action! Do not go for the front row if you don't want to be wet~

We did not see all the shows because they didn't sound very exciting; but did see some of the kiddo shows like ""When I grow up"". The rides were all good. Popular rides/ shows for children: A crate adventure, Madagascar Boogie, Meet and greet with Minions, Treasure hunters, water world, When I grow up, King Julien’s Beach party go-round, Dino soarin.Popular rides for everyone: Enchanted airways, Jurrasic Park Rapids adventure, Revenge of the mummy, Transformers, Battlestar Galactica.Battlestar Galactica is not for the weak hearts. Otherwise most of them can be done unless one has medical issues. USS does not allow any food/ drinks to be carried from outside. Water dispensers are available inside so carry am empty/ half full bottle. Indian food is not available inside and one will have to do with whatever is available at Discovery food court. Veg noodles was available but was full of mushroom.Overall, USS is a good place to spend your day in Singapore. Plan your day well though so you can have most fun.

The rides were fantastic, no lines at all during the whole day! The food was average in price and taste. However, on boarding the Jurassic Park Water Rapids ride, a male staff member was clapping his hands then pointing to the boat to grab guests' attention. I can understand using gestures to avoid a sore throat developing , however it is unacceptable to clap and point at guests like they are dogs.

review_439647430,“Absolutely amazing and great fun”,"I went alone on a quiet weekday and it was fantastic. The general overall appearance of the theme park are amazing and very highly detailed...it was very visual.The rides were all so much fun and when I went I had two bonuses...one was it was very quiet on a weekday (still lots of people) but most rides were only a couple of min wait. Two was that they cater for single people...it was surreal as the single line often snakes through the buildings completely separate from others in groups...as in they didn't just go parallel.If you are an adult wanting to go on all the major rides once and see the wonderful Waterworld stunt show then it will take about half a day. I can well imagine families with kids taking the whole day and there are always rides one can go on a few times.The park really caters for all ages extremely well and with live shows everywhere and character appearances it was really a great day.The cost is what one expects from the theme park as are the food prices, merchandising and photo opportunities on the rides.I thoroughly recommend this amazing park.Oh and last of all is the good design...the entire park loops around a central lake so when you walk from themed area to the next they all come back to the start. Much better than similar theme parks I have been to where one has to constantly backtrack and waste time and energy.

review_439421389,“Single Rider Line!”,"I visited the Universal Studios Singapore (USS) on November 21, 2016. It is a Monday, and it was not as crowded.As I visited the park alone, I was able to take advantage of the Single Riders Line, which was offered by most of the rides, except for the Galactica roller coasters.I was able to complete most of the rides in a 3 hour time frame. I was also able to cut the 60 minute waiting time for the Jurassic Park water ride to 5 minutes.While it is not as big as the Universal Studios in Orlando, it retained the same flavour as the one that I visited in Orlando. The Mel's diner was exactly the same as the one in Orlando, which was amusing for me. The only difference is that the USS is in a country that is a lot hotter and very humid, which makes waiting in line for long periods unpleasant.One big plus for me was that the USS has free locker rentals for guests who are taking the rides. I actually thought that was a really nice touch. And the lockers are automated, utilizing fingerprint technology to lock and unlock the lockers. I do not recall seeing such lockers in Orlando, so this is definitely very appreciated. Overall, a great day spent at the USS, and I would recommend it to my friends and family. I would also recommend going on a weekday, so you do not have to jostle with the weekend crowds.

If you just want to enjoy the atmosphere of Studios, you can go to 4DTheater, and I watched a movie call Shrek, it is very funny.This Studio is good places to take photo because of there have many styles; you must find a street that you like.

Having been to many theme parks and I rate this as very poor. Firstly overpriced for the size. Also many maintenance issues for example as you begin the Madagascar ride if you look up and to the right there a plug with nothing but electric tape hanging from it and at the end of the ride the sandpaper grip on the stairs is completely worn down. This is just one example but its so simple to fix. Mummy ride floor covered in black marks like candy or chewing gum also so dusty is some areas...looks so crap. Transformers switches on the way in most are broken. Food options are terrible, prices of everything ridiculous. I am happy to spend money on quality but there was just junk. We saw one character all day at opening of the park. Everything was money money money. If it wasnt for the waterworld(a lame movie from the 90s) show I would have given it a 1 star rating. Sorry never again for me, was boring and overrated so we cut our losses and left early to do something more fun.

There are 2 roller coasters and I would say go in the red one, as that is more dangerous. The transformers 4D ride is amazing and my little brother went 2 times. The queues are long, so better take an express ticket. The water ride in Jurassic Park is not worth the wait. WE had to stand for 2-3 hours in the queue and got very frustrated. The mummy ride is pretty good and you can visit it. When you enter Disney World, you had better do the Puss In Boots ride as that is very enjoyable and cute. The Madagascar world is not that great and suitable for small kids. The New York City is very good and there are also some American bands performing.

Its best to buy the tickets online in advance (saves valuable que time when you get there.. Best online option I found was Klook, which gave a 20% discount & issued single visit tickets with a 6 month entry date validity. Also, you will get ""influenced"" to buy the express add on tickets to avoid the long ques inside the park... Don't really have to fall for it.. It can get expensive at an additional SG$ 50 / head!! And you can only use the express option once for each ride. Essentially there are 5 - 6 rides that have the longest ques. If you can reach there by 10 am, & finish most of these rides before 11:30 am when there's lesser crowd, you save up-to SG $ 200 for a family of 4 like I did :-).So go ahead & have a blast..

review_438708428,“Wonderful Trip”,"This is Universal Studios Singapore!!! I visited to this place on May with my faculty exchange group. As we know the earth is the symbol of each Universal Studios.You must take some photos with the Earth when you go to Universal Studios. If you don’t, it seem you may not have been there. I mostly like this place is the Thrill rides. It have seven park layout in the theme park. I want to recommend the Ancient Egypt, The Lost World and Far Far away. It also suitable tee agate to play and try. There are many Ride you can have a challenge to try. Besides, the 3D transformer is so realistic screen in the movie of Transformers , we are sitting in a car and help Autobot Transformers conflict Megatron. I remember the car was falling down in the building, the 3D effect made us it is real, we are falling down now. It is too exciting and frighting. In addition, the Madagascar is suit for kids, because Madagascar is a animals movie so popular with kids,Moreover, it has a 4D movie is Shrek the Two so family can bring your kids to go to universal studios Singapore and also have many amusement rides is suitable for kids too.

If you are a huge fan of high adrenaline attractions only - you might not like this place as much but otherwise it's worth every penny for an entire day of fun with family or friends. Some of the key attractions I loved - Transformers (you really feel you're in the movie - amazing effects), Revenge of the Mummy (completely dark in door roller coaster), Shrek 4D adventure (decent for a normal 4D theatre sitting experience)

review_438192613,“Awesome day at the USS!!”,"My partner and I came here a couple of days ago and had the most amazing day! The battlestar galactica roller coasters were awesome (cylon is the better of the two but start with human as it is less intense), the mummy rollercoaster was exciting (it is completely in the dark so it keeps you guessing and it is totally air conditioned) and the transformers ride will blow your mind. The puss in boots ride is a little bizarre but everything there is a lot of fun. Little tips, buy the express wristband so you don't have to wait in line, we never had to wait more than 5 minutes for any ride) also don't go when it's raining as they shut down the battlestar galactica roller coasters.

Every crew member from the ticket counter to the ushers at the door were so enthusiastic and and happy to be there. It's looking like now most of them are bored with being there. I've met some really grumpy looking people today, mainly the assistants to the characters and the rides ushers. They don't even talk to you or ask you how many persons for the ride. They show you some number with their fingers. The park itself is very very well maintained after all these years and very clean still.

The rides appeared as they had been created on the 'cheap' with crappy movements (with the exception of the Madagascar ride).Lockers in the Revenge of the Mummy and the Rollercoaster were free for the 1st 45 minutes, but when we went to put bags in lockers for the Jurassic Park water ride, the price was $4 for an hour (no shorter times available or free minutes).

The entrance price is reasonable (paid SGD49) but express pass (top up SGD80) is expensive. It is very useful to skip the queues that can last up to 2 hours for one ride. So the express pass is a much helpful ticket (little to no wait).

You can certainly do this park in a day - we were there 4-5 hours including a lunch break. It's easy to get there from the Harbourfront MRT station, either walking the boardwalk or using the Sentosa express (S$4) - you can use your MRT card too, so no need to purchase a different ticket.We also purchased our tickets online which meant we didn't have to queue to enter.

The park was as expected, awesome. I have been to Disneyland, Knotts Berry Farm, and Universal Studios Los Angeles, and other parks around the world , so I love these kind of parks, and Universal Studios Singapore was in keeping with all of these. It is a bit smaller than the others l, but just as enjoyable. Too many highlights, Transformers ride, Battlestar Galactica, Jurassic Park, Shrek, and especially the Waterworld show. All of these on top of the awesomely themed areas and ambiance of the park made for an outstanding day. The only downfall is the cost of the souvenir photos they take of you. The prices are outrageous, I'm sure that if the pricing was more attractive, they would sell a lot more. This was an issue for us at all the major attractions in Singapore GET THE EXPRESS PASS!!!!

Don't come in expecting something like the original Hollywood park in the US or you will be disappointed - the iconic studio tour is missing for example. Taken on its own terms there are some fun experiences to be had.Standouts (you and your kids' mileage may vary depending upon how much you already love certain movies / characters):The Lost World / Jurassic Park Rapids ride - approaching the iconic gates with the Jurassic Park theme playing in the background made me feel like a kid again. The two giant T-Rex and Spinosaur statues in front of the food court that's made to look like the JB visitors centre (yeah there's even a T-Rex faux fossil skeleton as you enter!) pushed all my nostalgia buttons. My 5 year old loved the Jurassic Park Rapids ride.The Mummy roller coaster: Atmospheric and fun, not too intense (much like Disney's space mountain)Battlestar Galactica roller coaster: The one squarely aimed at adrenaline junkies; the Cylon track is the more intense of the two options Transformers the Ride: Surprisingly effective and fun mix of 3D and virtual motion based on the movie versions of these characters.Decent experiences:Madagascar carousel: Its a merry go round. With Madagascar themed characters and music - kids liked it Shrek 4D cinema: the seats moving with the action is a nice touch (still think HK Disney do it better with their philharmagic show but that's probably nostalgia bias)If you / your kids are big Shrek fans you may get a kick out of the full scale recreation of Shrek's hut (just external).Nothing to write home about: Just about everything else [note: the 'Lights, Camera, Action' attraction was closed on the day we went and we skipped the following as they just didn't excite us or our 5 year old: Puss in boots ride, Sesame Street stage show, JP canopy and dactyl ride, the mummy car ride].Tip: If you're willing to spend a bit more for the express tickets or use the single rider option to avoid the queues you can more or less be done by late afternoon / early evening.I really wish they would have more movie related references / replicas / props / characters in costume around the park. Their sound system is often playing iconic movie sound tracks which raises your expectations but with no pay-off. Oh wow there's the Back to the Future theme...is there a Delorean replica or the clock tower around the corner? Will I see someone in a Marty McFly costume? Uhhh no. Cool that's Danny Elfman's Batman theme from the '89 film...now where's the Batmobile!?!....(and so on, you get the idea).But they've randomly got a guy going around dressed as Beetlejuice and a lady dressed as Betty Boop (who? wha?...)

But there were A LOT of people.The attractions were really nice, but waiting in the queue was just a horrible experience under the sun. I'd rather pay 30 more SGD for my visit in the future and go for the express way. It would totally worth the price than waiting for 2-3 hours.Except for the weather, it was really nice and well decorated.Transformer and mummy rides were one of the best things in USS. Din Tai Fung in front of the entrance is worth visiting. It is one of the famous dim sum franchise restaurants in Asia.

Definitely put aside a full day to visit Universal if possible and purchase your tickets in advance of arrival to cut down queuing times.The shows and street performances were great, but pick up a show time table on arrival so that you can plan your day.We visited with our 4 year old and there were enough rides, shows and attractions suitable for this age group to make it well worth while. For slightly older kids it would be all the better.The themed 'lands' were so well done. The park is easy to navigate. Plenty of eating options, refreshment stands and shops.

review_434955640,“Great day out”,"what a fun day. I think it was a great time of year to go. It was still quite humid, but day isn't in Singapore? We were lucky to not have any storms on the day there. It was crowded at all. We have hardly any lines for any of the rides. We were considering to get the express line passes. $70 for the unlimited pass, or $50 for the one time on all the rides pass. That's on top of the entry cost. We ended up not getting it as it was not needed at all. I would recommend it though if you have limited time and it's peak season.The major rides has lockers to lock up you bags and it was free for 45min. It worked well, we were able to go on the same roller coaster 3-4 times in the 45 mins. It was great.The park it set up around an artifical lake so it's easy to manouver around the park as you just walk around from area to area.The battlestar galactica ride was great. The cyclon side of the coaster is the best. If there was bit of a wait for a ride my husband and I just went in the single rider line as we were happy to be split up if needed. The lines for that was so much shorter and it didn't bother us to rider separately.The transformer ride is a must as well. Great 3D simulator ride. The Sesame Street ride is so cute. And it was fun having the characters to get photos with. The food selections in the place was good. We had turkey legs which were great.We spent about 6 hours there. That was plenty of time. That's with also going on the roller coasters many times over and over. It great for all ages as there are plenty of younger rides and stages shows to check out.When you have time in Singapore this is a great place to visit. Especially if you are going to Sentosa Island.

review_434729071,“First Sentosa Trip”,"Universal Studios Singapore on Sentosa is definitely the No. 1 fun attraction in Singapore. There are a variety of rides for kids and adults, one can spend an entire day here. As we were staying on Sentosa, we took the opportunity not to miss visiting Universal Studios. If you're staying on Sentosa, it's really easy to get to Universal as all the hotels offer shuttle rides from the resorts to Universal every half hourly.It's costs approx. SGD$ 70.00 per adult to get into Universal Studio. A child's entrance is half that. The park opens at 9am and closes at 7pm, so go as early if you intend to try all the rides.We went at 4pm as we did not intend to go on all the rides as our 3 year old boy could not get onto most the rides. We only ended up going on the Madagascar and Sesame Street rides. The remaining hours were used touring around Universal and buying souvenirs at the Universal Store. We passed the many rides and they all looked awesome. There was a Shrek ride, Jurassic Park, Ancient Egypt ride, Galactic Rocket ride etc. Its a pity the rides were mainly for teenagers and adults; not suitable for young children. As per other amusement parks, the lines are pretty long, even on the week day that we went. So bring lots of bottled water to hydrate yourselves as Singapore is very hot and humid just about all year through.Don't miss visiting Universal Studio if you're ever in Sentosa, Singapore. It's great fun!

My daughter loved the Puss in Boots ride so this was done more times than I can remember!The meet and greets were great with plenty of photo opportunities.The whole park is clean, well maintained and safe.If you visit midweek, out of season, you can easily get around the park in 1 day including seeing all the shows etc but if you're planning to visit at busier times i.e.. weekend (especially during summer hols) I would definitely recommend buying the Express pass.All in all, a memorable day out for all ages.

It is difficult to complete majority of the haunted houses and rides on a single night. The advice is to purchase the express pass. However, do take note the express pass is like stock price, the price will go up due to demand. The advertised price online was S $40 for express pass without rides. S $50 for express pass with rides. When I visited on Saturday 29 Oct 16, the price was S $120 for express pass without rides and S $140 for express pass with rides. See how much the price went up due to demand? The opening hours is from 0730pm till 0130am on Saturday. Normal day is till 1230am. So it is extremely difficult to cover many places since the long queue is about 2 hours each for the more popular haunted houses. So I suggest book the tickets early and buy express pass early so as to avoid disappointment. And bring rain coat during Halloween period as it usually rain at night.

We have visited nearly all the places and found out it was all about roller coasters :pBut at the end, the whole place is for kids. There is nothing special for the adults.

review_433432039,“fun and great time”,"1. stayed in tune hotel JB, they provide cheap accomodation and shuttle to USS at RM30/person. The shuttle leave at 730 am and back at 730 pm2. prepare your rain coat unless you are prepared to have the whole day in wet outfit in case of rain or wet attractions.3. Food sold here are a bit expensive, bring your own simple food for back up. Theres a row of Malaysian Street food just outside the entrance to savor Malaysian flavor.4. The prayer room is separated from place you can take your wudhu, nearby toilet is at Hollywood Chinese restaurant. bring your own bottle of water to ease the process.5. Attractions are quite low in people at around 3 pm and above, so its a better time to go rather than wait for almost an hour just to get into an attraction.

review_433310955,“Family Holiday to Singapore - Brilliant day at Universal Studios Park.”,"I would like to set the scene by saying I have visited universal studios in Florida. Admittedly it was over 25 years ago and, I do remember that holiday with rose tinted glasses. So what ever was happening Singapore's park had some living up to do....We visited the park midweek and during the rainy season, which I am guessing meant there was a reduced footfall. The 4 of us got a day pass for 260 SD. (about 155 quid). That was 2 adults and 2 juniors. Which sounds like lots of money but at the current exchange rate it really wasn't that bad. We used the MRT to get around Singapore for the 10 days we were there, but to get to Santosa Island we took the Santosa Express, this is an additional 4 dollar charge. Alternatively you can also walk for free or take a taxi.As you approach the spinning universal globe outside its nothing short of amazing. A huge photo opportunity! The park was everything you would expect to see at these these places. The kids were literally bouncing. The themed areas worked nicely. We all loved Donkey and his experience at the theatre. There aren't absolutely loads of coasters but there is a healthy mix meaning we could all go on almost everything together. Our youngest is 5. We waited very little time at all for any of the rides dispite the park feeling fairly busy. As with most attractions in Singapore if there is a lightening storm the rides etc get shut down. This happened to us and there was some quite heavy rain. We just scheduled our lunch into the storm, and by the time it finished so did we.We managed to ride pretty much every ride. The longest wait we had on the day was less than 20 mins. The rides were all pretty good. Kids both loved the Transformers ride. I also got to meet a Marilyn Monroe look alike. #chuffed.What a great day out. As a grown up I enjoyed the park as much as young me did the Florida park way back then... This means that yes Universal Singapore, i thoroughly recommend you!

review_433164341,“Halloween Horror Nights 6”,"Although the starting DJ segment is a bit overlong (not really my cup of tea) the rest of the experience was great, the haunted houses was well designed and the attention to detail in the props and decoration used was great. I went during off peak days (it was thursday night), so I have more chance to enjoy the ambience and overall 'feel' of the park, still, other guests keep bumping into me from behind and forcing me to move ahead, I can only imagine it gets worse at busy nights.Minor complaints, the smoke machine produced some awful smelling smokes (at least for me), and there are many empty and unused area (which is understandable), maybe next year more area will be used

review_433157775,"“Don't wait in line, get an Unlimited Express pass”","From VivoCity it is just a few minutes on the special monorail to the park, a return ride cost 4S$.It was Halloween so tickets were a bit more expensive although we did not attend the horror nights after 7:30pm. We bought a standard ticket S$70 and express pass S$50 online. At the park we decided to upgrade for 20S$ extra and get the unlimited pass as the other pass only allows you to skip the queue 1 time per selected attractions. The feeling of skipping every line was amazing, although it was not crazy busy, waiting in line with screaming kids, people sweating as it's 30 degrees is not fun. We usually waited around 3-5 minutes. In 6 hours we did all the attractions and shows and most rides we did 2 or 3 times. As you cannot bring your bags or anything loose on the ride, you need to put them away in the free lockers near the rides. This included both dueling roller coasters and The Mummy Ride. It's okay to wear hats/glasses which you can leave behind before you step into the ride. For Jurassic Park you can take them with you but a big chance you get wet. You can buy a poncho in the vending machine. Must visit is also the show Waterworld, very entertaining, just don't sit in the splash zone or you might get soaking wet.The park is absolutely beautiful, all English, clean and well maintained, will recommend it to everyone looking for adventure and adrenaline! After you leave the park there are plenty of other things to do and see on the island.

review_433157736,“Michael kelly”,"We were charged what I believe was an excessive entry fee. Once entering we were confronted with up to 90 minutes waiting time for the rides - included in this was a 20 minute wait for a basic hot dog. Heaven forbid if we had thought to frequent one of the restaurants. We waited for over an hour for the Transformers ride which at times gave myself and my wife claustrophobia as we were herded like cattle through queues. Finally there was nothing that even resembled a healthy food option. In conclusion the worst place we have visited on any of our many overseas trips. We opted to leave and spend an extra 4 hours at the airport, rather than continue our time there.

review_433149479,“Halloween Horror Nights 6 was lots of spooky fun! :)”,"I visited USS with friends for the Halloween Horror Nights 6 events and had a great time. I strongly suggest joining the queue at the entrance by 6.30pm even though the doors open at 7pm as a huge crowd will form by then. The night kicks off with a very crowded (and very warm!) DJ party at 7.10pm and opening ceremony at 7.30pm, so wear sensible walking shoes, keep your belongings close to you at all times and bring some water with you to keep hydrated and cool (drinks are available to purchase on site but very expensive at 6.50SGD for a bottle of water!).I highly recommend purchasing the express queue add-on as my friends and I thought it was definitely worth it to be able to complete ALL 5 haunted houess (Hawker Centre Massacre, Salem Witch House, Hu Li's Inn, Old Changi Hospital and Bodies Of Work) in one night in addition to the Suicide Forest, Scared Shrekless (a Halloween exclusive showing) and some other rides. The express queue gets you into the haunted houses within 5 minutes, whereas for the normal queue you could be queueing for up to 2 hours to get into the more popular haunted houses such as Old Changi Hospital.Out of the 5 haunted houses, I enjoyed Hu Li's Inn the most personally as I thought the sets and costumes were very pretty with a twisted macabre feel to them (loved the mirror maze!). I didn't find any of the haunted houses scary (my friends did though and screamed a lot), but that's mainly because I'm quite desensitised to horror movies (one of the boys jokingly complained I was too brave for a girl haha). However, I did appreciate the huge amount of effort and detail they must have put into the designs of the haunted houses, especially for Old Changi Hospital where even the graffiti on the walls is said to be an exact replica of the real thing. Have a action plan just in case it rains (the outdoor rollercoasters all close when this happens) as we were caught up in heavy rain towards the latter end of the evening and quickly rushed indoors to see the Nightmare Circus act. On the whole, Halloween Horror Nights at USS was lots of spooky fun! :)

This theme park was so crowded even on weekdays, so I'll suggest you to come as early as possible. You probably want to take some pictures in front of the 'popular' USS globe and after the gate open, go straight to Battlestar and Mummy rides because they are the most popular rides (i think). The most popular water ride is Jurrasic Park Rapids Adventure. Around 3 pm the queue was sooo long, it would take around 1.5 hours to get to the end so I decided not to take it.Some of the rides don't allow you to bring your bags and other items (even phone!) so they prepare lockers you can rent.

review_432286377,"“Great rides, all level of thrills - get a Fast Pass though”","We had a thoroughly enjoyable day at Universal Studios on Sentosa Island, Singapore. The park opened at 10am and we were there ready for the gates to open. There were queues already, so by the time we made inside, we headed to the first ride which was Sesame Street Spaghetti Space race. Very cute ride and fun for all ages. The next ride was Transformers 3D so we jumped in the queue. After a short while in the queue, there was an announcement that the wait time was one hour 15 minutes but we decided to hang in there, assuming that the queue would only get longer. It did indeed get longer and it took us nearly 2 hours in the queue to get to the ride. Transformers is an awesome ride but we figured that we would never get around the whole park if we had to wait 2 hours for each of the big thrill rides. So we purchased an Express pass to get us through the queues more quickly - but one time per ride only. You can get an unlimited fastpass but we decided not to do that option. This meant that we started at the gates again and went the opposite direction and managed to get onto all the rides with a waiting time of less than 20 minutes for each ride. Some we were able to walk straight on and others we still had to queue such as Transformers (yes, we did go back) the Battlestar Galactica duelling coasters, Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, Revenge of the Mummy. Food options at Universal were the usual park fare, but toilets were clean and there were plenty of water bubblers scattered around. Best rides were Transformers, Revenge of the Mummy and the Cylon version of the Battlestar Galactica rollercoasters (which was weird because it had the shorter lines).I would recommend you stay as long as possible because after we used our fastpasses up, close to closing time you could go on any ride without any wait as most people have left.Quick tip - if you are looking for a cheap and easy feed that is NOT in the park (either on your way back to your hotel or come out during the day) I totally recommend Malaysian Food Street with authentic hawker dishes that taste delicious and are inexpensive.

review_432062877,“Great day out ”,"Made my first visit to a universal studios and was not completely disappointed. It was great to go on a Tuesday when there was not too many crowds but this still made the wait for some rides from 10-55 minutes.... I was surprised the rides were so short, in most cases the rides ranged from 30 seconds to 60 seconds, so after a wait for 1 hour the 60 second ride seem to have lost its shine.... The most amazing ride with the shortest wait was the Transformers ride, it was so unexpectedly great my friends and I lined up and did it twice.... Definitely recommend that one.... As you can expect the food variety is not great and expensive and considering you can't take food into the park, you better be prepared for fried foods......Did not manage to see any of the street shows, was too busy queuing up for rides, so was a little disappointed there was not that much happening outside the rides..... The friends I was traveling with, who are seasoned movie studios regulars, said it was more of themed park than anything to do with studios or shows like you see in the states. Was it worth the $75 yes I would say, but Only because it was not a busy day, had it been busy you would struggle to get on 3or 4 rides in a day.

Highly recommend you buy the Express Pass up front (you will need to purchase this on top of the entrance ticket) as the more people that arrive on the day, the more expensive the express pass becomes .. the prices goes up on any given day depending on the crowds, so do yourself a favour and buy it before you get there to save time and money. The Transformer Ride is probably the best ride there and recommend you go there first. Food and Beverages are reasonably priced. There is also a Starbucks there. There is no backlot studio, so it is really an amusement park with lots of rides. Take plenty of sunscreen and water as it gets very hot. Allow a whole day to enjoy all rides.

review_430532462,“Must visit place and here is the plan / itinerary / strategy”,"First the review, it was very fun and enjoyable day in USS. From the rides to the show and performances to the photos with live characters, we enjoyed every bit of it.USS is not that big, but covering all the things is bit difficult without a plan in a day.Here are the tips to make most out of a day visit and to help you prepare a plan.Some preparations...1. Book your tickets online, from official website or from klook.com to get cheaper rates.2. Try to go on week days and not on weekend or holidays.3. Have good breakfast and have some food/supplies packed in a bag, if you don't want to waste time in proper lunch and dinning (at least 1:30 hour). No need to pack water bottles, you just need one bottle which can be re-filled at water fountains at various places in USS (Free). 4. Wear comfortable attire. It may be hot outside so come prepared.5. Get map online and study a bit. It is bit tedious but type the attractions in YouTube and watch the video to get idea about attraction. By watching you get to know if that's your cup of tea or not. ;)Now tips to enjoy as many attractions as possible and our experience...6. Reach there by 9.15. You can take pictures of the Universal globe before entry and after exit in the evening.7. Queue around 9:30-9:40 (or early): I know it's too early, but trust me when you will see the crowd (even on week days) you will thank me. 8. Enter at 10: If you have bought tickets online you can show it on your phone, the bar code will be scanned for entry, no need to get any paper or tickets separately.9. Get the map : Just when you cross the entry point where you showed your ticket (bar-code), take maps from the stand on your right side. Don't forget to take small single paper which has all the shows timings.10. Don't take pictures, I repeat, Don't take pictures : No matter what, control yourself from taking out your cameras. I know this is hard but your first priority is to finish with attractions. You will get more than enough time for pictures in second half. Again trust me if you wait a little for pictures you will face 30 to 60 minutes of queue in every attractions. The rides are not even 1 min long but the queue might be 30 mins.Now the execution with some declaimers... - USS is not big as I said, we are around 27 old and we are lazy couple but still it was not hard to walk around. So if you can, you don't have to follow linear direction. - We don't have kids so we gave importance to adults rides. Following is the order in which if you follow you will be free by around 2 with important attractions.11. Transformers: The Ride (Sci-fi City) - This is the best and popular ride. So run for it after step 9. This may be crowded but don't be disappointed it's worth the queue. (We did not follow step 7 so we faced 30 min queue.) Here you need to leave your belongings in locker. The lockers are charged based on time. Lucky part is for early time you will get free locker for some time.12. Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride (Ancient Egypt) : This is interesting and not that scary. This ride is in dark, not scary but it has element of surprise. Again here as well you will need to leave your belongings in locker and you will need to pay. Buy only 1 hour for 4 SGD and keep all the belongings in locker here including cameras and electronics. This is for next ride.13. Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (The Lost World): This is slow ride but at the end you may get wet (not too much). So the step 12 above where you have kept all the things in locker will save some dollars for ponchos. You don't need to buy ponchos, you will dry out in the sun outside in few minutes.14. Canopy Flyer (The Lost World): The lost world is not straight forward also not much tricky. Find this attarction and have fun. Tip is to get front rows (Entry point 1 & 3). If you don't get, just get in the queue and let others go.Now this is the point where you have beat the queue and finished major attractions. Rest attractions will have queues but will move faster. Now check the show timings of shows and look for must see show - Water worldNow after this show it was time when we thought we have finished important attractions and it was worth the ticket price we paid. All the other rides and shows we enjoyed was sort of add-on. You will have now enough time for other things and photos. But still check the timings of shows and follow the plan.Here is our experience. Tip is to have pics at the end of the show with the characters. Queue starts where the attendants are ;)1:15 PM - Waterworld2:00 PM - Madagascar Boogie!2:45 PM - The Minions3:30 PM - AUTOBOTS, Roll Out!4:30 PM - Meet Diane, Jurassic Park's Newest Addition!4:40 PM - The Dance For The Magic Beans5:00 PM - Look out!

review_430311472,“Time well spent with the kids!!”,"We did not do everything possible in the park, but chose based on the kids' interests and our health (we dropped many of the rides/roller coasters). Whatever we did we had a great time!We loved the madagascar crate adventure ride! Then the shrek 4-d movie! followed by the puss in boots ride, the awesome steven spielberg set 'lights camera action', egyptian explorer jeep ride. The lines at the rides were not long - not too many tourists were around. I am sure it would be very crowded during peak seasons. Do not miss!

review_430263095,“Must Visit Place when you go to Sentosa Island!”,"The Place is a must visit. People generally avoid the place due to expensive entry ticket but you should understand that the ticket includes all the rides unlimited times. The rides are awesome and lot of photo opportunity. You can purchase the pass from local people at a discounted rate. Make sure you start early and be there by 9am or 10 am so you can cover everything. They close early.

review_430222041,“Staff attitude at a new low!”,"Took my kid on a 3-day trip in Singapore. Naturally, Universal Studio was among the top of the list. Mid-October heat was almost too unbearable even for a person living in SE Asia. The queue was not long for the popular roller coaster rides or 4D theaters. I didn't mind the fact that the place is not on par with Universal Studio in the US. That, I could understand. But what I couldn't hack was the fact that staff attitude must have been at an all-time ""low"". Most if not all have appeared as if they were forced to come to work. Words uttered from their mouth were not welcoming. Their body language suggested they were reprimanding naughty students rather than their paying customers. People came here to have a good time with their loved ones. There shouldn't be things to spoil their good spirit.....particularly, from the crew staff.Tried the food at the outlet behind the giant T-Rex. The food was edible but the Manager should be there to supervise their cleaner not to make screeching sound by dragging or pushing the chairs and tables while they are cleaning. This has made an unpleasant dining experience.

review_430185147,“HHN6 & RIP Tour”,"It was an excellent choice to have the RIP Tour where you can get to all haunted houses and skip all the long lines. The best part about the tour is also the amazing guide, Rashid. He went beyond expectations and extra mile to entertain not only us but other guests while an attraction broke down. He did bring in some entertainment to the crowd while we were waiting for Jack's show at Pantages to start as well. This is why everyone (his colleagues especially) adores him! Haunted houses were unique but tiny and low ceilings for certain areas. There were way too much smoke going on making it difficult to breathe and see. There should be more going on in the scare zone. Kinda miss the scare zone during HHN2! The opening act was amazing! Something like that could have been set up at Ancient Egypt, opposite Revenge of the Mummy. It was too quiet in that area. Overall, great job, my friends and I enjoyed ourselves!

review_429698848,“Amazing theme park”,"We were a bit skeptical to go to Universal Studios during our time in Singapore as we were weary of the common pitfalls of theme parks in genera (crowded, disorderly, dirty, overpriced, unbearably long waiting times), however to our surprise we encountered none of these setbacks during our trip. The park is very well set out and a decent amount of rides and attractions are there to enjoy throughout a full day. The rides are all very enjoyable (particular favourites were The Mummy and Battlestar Galactica) and the amount of effort taken to ensure each ride and its respective waiting area was decorated to suit each respective theme was outstanding. Moreover, there are a few very reasonable food options available - we went to a chinese restaurant near the entrance of the park which came to a fair price given we were in a theme park. Moreover, the staff is very attentive and helpful. All in all, an extremely enjoyable day at Universal Studios. Would definitely recommend.

review_429674557,“Amazing time in Universal studios with family”,"It was great to visit this place specially for my kids. If you want to enjoy all attractions reach early to this place because it closes at 6 pm and there is usually long queues at popular attractions. If you already can estimate the rush then I would recommend to purchase express tickets otherwise you will end up waiting in long queues. Another option is to use single rider line. This is normally fast compared to regular one. Kids below certain height/age are not allowed in many rides. So people going with kids should already check the rides where everybody can enjoy. I could experience the transformer, lost world and medagaskar sections. The transformer ride was really amazing.

There are a lot of good picture spots, food stalls and great performances in different areas. The time we visited, there were no long waiting lines so we got to maximize our time. Unfortunately, they needed to close the park earlier for them to prepare for their Halloween attraction which guests need to pay extra. But the overall experience was really unforgettable.

review_429518241,“Fun and Memorable”,"Went here in July 2016, one of the Sunday, peak season. Packed with people. If you have extra budget, please do buy the Express Ticket, it will save you lots of time and give you unlimited rides. Expensive but totally worth it in my opinion, especially if you do multiple times in certain rides, for example the famous Jurrasic Park.We loved this place and we will revisit the place again once we have the chance.

The best ride would have to be the Transformer ride. If you want to beat the lines and don't mind going on the rides without your friends I suggest you take the single rider line. You get to have so many more rides that way. The 4D cinema was amazing. It was so real I found myself screaming.

Overall the kiddos enjoyed most of the park especially Jurassic Park, Transformer, Madagascar and Sesame Street. Importantly wear comfortable shoes (standby a flip flop) and bring extra clothing to change before heading back to JB. You need fresh clothing after all the activities and to feel comfortable throughout the massive jem along the causeway. Pack food to munch in the transport cause you will reach JB quite late.

However, in some games they should give the warning to the players (like in Ancient Egypt or the roller coaster, they doesn't suit little kids or elder or someone who has problem with their hearts).One day is not enough to enjoy all games.

First of all it was Monday we went, thinking there will be less crowd. but the crowd was so much that the wait time for every ride was 1 hour in queue. Imagine to finish all the sequence will take almost 13 hours. We went to buy the express ticket, they mark up the price from 30 Sing Dollar to 50 Sing Dollar + 103 USD already paid total 153 USD, after buying the pass we still could complete all the sequence. it was sheer waste of money. Universal studio guy should limit the same of ticket per day. It feel cheated after paying 103 Sing Dollar and have to wait in queue. Infact the timing are too short from 10 am to 6 pm. it should open till mid night in order to enjoy the same.

review_428783884,“Three days @singapore with 7months baby.. ”,"Hi.. looking for a trip to singapore,here are some quick tips.  We were 3 adults and 1 infant and we were travelling from Kualalumpur,Malaysia.As we planned our trip 2 days prior to our date of journey,flight price was high.so we travelled by bus which is RM 54/pax.we started at 5pm and it took around 5 hours (including immigration time).We have to get down twice (KL border and Singapore border).so by the time we reached our hotel (Little India) it's been 11.30pm.If you have kids or infants,carry all their stuff (water,food,snacks,diapers,extra clothes,baby fan).Food is not allowed inside but if you have infants and small kids,they will permit.DAY 1:Morning we reached UNIVERSAL STUDIOS at 9.30am by local bus.We purchased entry ticket and there was not much queue.They give some free shopping and food coupons which can be used inside. please carry umbrella/hats as the sun is so horrible and try to wear cotton clothes.We get water bottles and food there but a bit expensive.And after all stuff. .coming to our favourite rides,there are many rides and each ride has its speciality.TIP:If you are single to go for a ride,your queue will be very less.And if you are couple and more,have to queue. (Go as single one after other and mostly u get seated side by side)1.Roller coaster: there are 2 types of roller coasters..Blue and Red..but there was very big Queue.we were almost in queue for 2 hrs 15min,its better to avoid those who are weak hearted .2.Transformers Ride: I say this is the best ride.You will b atmost thrilled. Transformers lovers,don't miss this ride.3.Mummy ride: Little scary ride.4. zoorasic park: kids enjoy this. There are many more rides for kids . There is also a bollywood film making show (sitting in first 1 to 5 rows get wet) There are open cage birds,Tiger,train rides etc.There is dolby atmos 4d movie.And in the evening, we went to Casino.Day 2:We had our breakfast and went to dolphin show at 10.30.Actually it should be named seol show ;),It was $35 for entry fee and you can visit Aquaria after that.If you have visited aquarias at Kualalumpur or other place..better skip this and use your time and money for other place.Afternoon we had our lunch near santosa as for dolphin show there are free buses to/from santosa. After that we explored some new places near white sand beach.And went to marine bay..from there,they take on boats across Singapore night life/light's . Laser show is good but I expected much as it's a tourist attraction.DAY 3:We went to Little India for some shopping.Gold designs are awesome over there.Am a bit gold lover (collection).Then some malls.went to flower garden and created snowfall cool place and Gardens By the Bay.It is good place with various colours of light. We returned Kualalumpur by flight.Hope this helped you out to plan your trip.All the Best and safe journey.

But yeah, I was all wrong. The USS delivered a different vibe compared to it's counterpart in Hollywood in many ways. Their features were almost different except for some major attractions like The Mummy and Waterworld. I really enjoyed my visit in the USS. I just hoped that I have more time as 10am-4pm was never enough because of very long lines. And I wish that next time, I will be travelling with someone who actually enjoys daring rides like me otherwise I will end up riding them alone or not riding them at all. The USS souvenirs were fantastic, alot some budget for it.

review_428666961,"“Universal Studios, Singapore”","Universal Studios in Singapore is AMAZING because of the rides and how it's set up and the food. You can get amazing Singaporean food and much more. There are many thrilling rides like the Battlestar Galactica Human VS Cyclon. The Cyclon is quite more scarier than the human because it goes upside down. The Revenge of the Mummy is not for the young because of the frightening seeing. The Jurassic Park Ride was really cool but you do get soaked. The puss'n'boots ride is good for the young with small turns and speed. The canopy flyer is a lamer ride but really good for the young. The Madagascar ride has a really good story too it but not rough. The Waterworld is an array of water stunts that are amazing. Meeting the Minions is good for young ones.

review_428454076,“DON'T EXPECT the same as in Orlando”,"The ""Transformers ride"" broke after we were there (wife and two children) for more than one hour on the queue. A recorded voice told on the speakers "" we have technical issues ....we don't know when is going to be back again....you may stay to wait but we invite you to go to other attractions..."". As I had similar experience in Orlando and back there they gave us a ""fast pass"" to compensate that I asked the supervisor Mr ""X"" (I have the name, just don't want to expose him) the same thing but he replied this was not ""our politics "". I asked ""how come?"" And got ""we would brake if we do something like that!""""So I must believe this happens everyday?"" I said, and he shook his head positively, with a smile.By the end of the day I went to costumer care to fill a complaint and was informed I would have an answer in 3 days...Sadly nothing came to my mailbox after more than ONE month.

review_428396813,“Wonderful ”,"This is a place for children and adult. We love this place. This is beyond our expectation. The transportation from Chinatown to Sentosa is super easy. Only a little bit walk from Sentosa monorail station. Of course we got entrance ticket from Seawheel at People's park at China Station which cheaper than the gate. We arrived in the morning and line up for entrance. We begin with the Most busiest and plan our schedule. We spend 6 hours there with 90% of them. Recommended to all but weekday is better!

review_428335468,“Fun day for the kids!”,"We went there on a weekday so it was not too crowded. We followed their recommendation and rented a stroller for our 4 year old so that we could push her around rather than tire her out walking around half a day. We purchased the Universal Express tickets which allowed us to the fast lane for the rides which saved us a lot of time! Some rides were very popular and waiting times for the popular rides ran up to 60 minutes. Food inside the theme park was average but i guess no one goes there looking for great food. Overall, it is possible to finish off the park in a day at a leisurely pace. There's something for all ages in the park.

Best activity is Transformers but Jurassic park is fun, too. You do not actually get soaking wet as they warn you. This Universal is not as big as in the USA but perfect to have a nice day without getting too tired of waiting for all the activities. Arrived at 11, left at 4.30.

Most rides had a queue of some sort, but getting the ""Jump the Queue/Express"" ticket helped to reduce waiting time. NOTE: It is better to purchase your Express ticket before you go - on the website the Express tickets were $SG30 and at the gate they were $SG70! We found this out the hard way.Take a water bottle, and fill it up at the various drink stations around the park.

review_428066891,“Not a great amusement park”,"My family and I all had high hopes for this amusement park as everyone in KL was saying that it was great. We decided to stay a weekend in Singapore and this was one of the first places we came. The line for the tickets was so long, which is quite normal at an amusement park, but when it was our turn and we had to pay I was shocked by how much it costed for 4 tickets. However we bought them, went in and were surprised by how few good rides there actually were. I was expecting more and hope that Universal Studios Singapore does something to make it better. The minion place was great and so was Elmo street: there were nice places but again, no rides. Also Singapore is unpredictable with rain and most rides become closed when it rains.

review_428046354,"“Amazing, full day activity- Must visit in Singapore.”","Family looking for thrill, fun , relaxing outing for whole day, please head to Universal studio. Must visit in Singapore.Reaching Universal studio by MRT is easier and at an average takes around 45 minutes. Head to Harbor front station and from Vivo city mall level 3, take Sentosa Express. (One stop from Vivo city).When we went on Monday (Avoid weekends and Holidays as que for rides would be longer!) there was not much q in ticket counter. Please be there around 9.30 am as studio opens at 10 am. Half an early helps you take ticket and snaps near the entrance.There are different types of rides- Thrill rides like Transformer, Egyptian Mummy ride, Sci-fi ride, and not so thrill, dizzying , yet enjoyable ride like Jurassic park, Enchanting airways and for various rides and shows for kids . Most of the thrill rides will have long q and waiting time over one hour. Waiting time is displayed near the entrance of each ride and it matches with the actual waiting time.Brave hearts ,once you enter, head to sci fi, rides, where the waiting time is quite longer.(Avg waiting time at any given time is 110 minutes) . Transformer ride is quite popular and have a waiting time of 100 to 110 minutes. we did this ride at lunch time as that, time waiting time was 45 minutes. Weak hearts, you may skip some rides in Sci fi , but don't miss any thrill rides like transformer, Mummy, Enchanting airways and some rides in Jurassic park.KIds below 10- 12 years have many options in studio with slow rides, shows , walk, and parade of cartoon character etc. Parents, please see the schedules and plan your activities.Don't miss show at water front station and 4 D show at castle. Food is expensive so as souvenirs. We had food near Ancient Egypt. Food was ok and ambiance was good. We had late lunch as we focused on popular ride at lunch time, when q is shorter.While return we took free bus ride to Vivo city mall as Sentosa express was crowded and long q to board the train and spent an hour or two in Vivo city mall, before heading to Hotel for much needed rest.Master card holder and holder of boarding pass of certain airlines will get 10 % discount on entry ticket.

review_427674066,“Great entertainment for kids and their childish parents :)”,"Sentosa Island is all about entertainment and Universal Studios Singapore is a pinnacle of that entertainment.It is a relatively small place, you can visit all of the attractions in just one day if you plan carefully and are determined. The main obstacles are the crowds, especially on weekends (Fridays included). At the most popular attractions you can expect lines up to 2h long.The ways of beating up the crowds are:1. Come on a weekday in low season (google up the seasons and crowd estimations)2. Come early - 15 minutes before opening and run, start with the most popular attractions. Google up the popularity of the attractions.3. Buy Universal Express or Universal Express Unlimited passes. They ARE expensive, they may easily double the entrance price, but if you have little time (as we had) they make all the difference. They allow entry to the attractions with no or almost no waiting (in our case: max 15 min).If you are a Pokemon Go player, there are some rare Pokemon spawning in USS in the morning, just after opening. If you need Pikachu, this is the way to go. Also, there are lots of Pokemon spawning everywhere across the park all the day long, many of them rare.

And quickly go to the queue. And if you can run to the transformer ride. Because it is the longest queue in the universal studio. And it is the best 4d ride in universal studio. Then go to the rollercoaster if you wish. Go to the cylon. Because it is the most thrilling one. After the head to the mummy ride. Then the rush items are over. At about 12pm and 3pm there is a water show @water world.Go for it. Superb real show. But Brace your self to get wet. It is very hard to do all the activities in one day.

Got there just before park open. Went there on a weekday. Did not get express pass as it was not crowded. Managed to do some rides multiple times. Park did get crowded towards lunch time. Transformer Ride was excellent and a hit with my kids. Other rides were good too. Would give this park a 5 rating, however it is let down by poor dining options- food court is terribly expensive and food taste like CRAP! You cannot bring in any kind of food into the park except water.(yes, staff will check your bags at entrance) If you want, get a re-entry stamp and eat outside, cheaper and more options. Also not many characters mascot walking around like Minions, Transformer, etc. They all have timetable. So if you miss timing, you have to wait around until they return. So annoying! Also don't bother buying a poncho for Jurassic Park river raft ride, you won't get totally drenched, just a splash or two. Did not bother about renting their lockers either as I had a waterproof back pack.Overall, a nice and enjoyable theme park, especially for kids and those young at heart!

review_427192723,“Enjoyable but bring your patience”,"The rollercoasters were the highlight for us. Went on a Wednesday and longest we waited for anything was 30min (average of 5-15min), so glad we didn't pay for an express pass, as it wouldn't have been worth it for our visit. Waits definitely got worse as the day went on, so arrive early if you can.Bought our tickets in advance online to save $ and time. Was disappointed to find that the queue to redeem our purchase was longer than the actual ticketing counters on arrival.The real spoiler for us though were the large groups of travellers with absolutely no manners or etiquette. These groups were seriously 80% of visitors and all day we were subjected to 8-12ppl pushing in front of us at each ride. Their tactic is to have someone wait in line and at the last minute a horde of ppl run up the express lane and jump the barrier into the normal queue, increasing your wait time. Staff should curb this behaviour through better crowd control.Another unpleasant and frequent occurrence were the selfie sticks being shoved in front of my face on the more tame rides blocking my view. The culprits were of course the very same visitor ""groups"" who defy staff instruction and seem to have a personal mission to ruin everyone else's experience. For these reasons, we will never return.We found staff friendly and helpful, but food crap/overpriced. Suggest exiting for lunch and then reentering to continue your day. Lockers should also be free, though this didn't affect us on a weekday given fairly short wait times. Travel light if coming at peak times or be prepared to fork out to store your belongings!

review_427098163,“Absolute heaven for big and little kids”,"Big and little kids alike had an amazing time at Universal studios. Arrive early so you can purchase tickets and get in line for 10am opening. When purchasing We visited just after Singapore school holidays and a public holiday, and 5 days before the formula one event, so luckily wasn't as busy as we thought it was going to be. We ended up not purchasing the fast track tickets as we tried to do visit most rides and shows before it got busy around midday. Not all rides open early, so make sure you get in line when they do, such as the Lost world rides. Heres a good tip if your happy to risk not riding together with family and friends - use the single lane tickets. When it got busy this is what we did to fast track rides, otherwise the wait was more than half an hour. Loved the transformer, mummy rides if your a bit more adventurous and Shrek rides with the younger kids. The Waterworld show was spectacular and the initial pre entertainment before the show started was hilarious - make sure you sit out of the wet zone if you want to not get wet !!!!!The Egypt and Lost World areas were our favourite of all shows snd rides. Recommend buying the slurpie refill if you want to top up drinks.We also got to Unviersal studios via vivi city via the walking travellator, which the kids thoroughly enjoyed.Also we had many opportunities to take photos with the Transformers, Frankenstein, Minions...would have been nice to see more characters roaming around

We did get the fast pass but probably didn't need it even though it was Aussie school holidays. We were expecting long lines but that was only for a couple of the more popular rides and I'm really talking about waiting maybe 10-15 mins tops. Perhaps do your homework first and see if the locals have a designated holiday or not, it might determine whether you need one. If you're after a proper 'meal' there are a number of venues just outside in the open air mall which I'd recommend.

Different verity of food available, slight expensive than outside. Transformer , Mummy, Roller coaster (Human) have so long waiting time. So if u don't have express pass try to be early in USS. As i waited more than an hour and 15 minutes for transformer and Roller coaster the mummy took around 40 minutes.

review_426363424,“Awesome experience!”,"I visited this place twice - with friends the first time and with kids the second time. Drinking fountains are everywhere so if you want to save some bucks, carry a bottle with you. It would be nice to purchase an express ticket so you don't have to queue for hours. If it's peak season however, the express tickets won't do any good. One day will not be enough to experience all the rides. If you are travelling with kids, make sure to ride the Transformer Ride, Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, Madagascar: A Crate Adventure, and Shrek 4-D Adventure. Those are my kid's favorite!

review_426259875,“Probably the best attraction in Singapore”,"If you are travelling with kids and young adults, this is a must see. Well organized, clean and safe place.Tickets are costly, we got a deal from klook and booked online in advance. It was a weekday and didn't opt for express pass. The maximum wait time for us was may be 40 minutes, but on an average 15-20 minutes if you are not opting for an express pass on a weekday. As we had 4 of us, it would have been another $120 to shell out, we thought we will not buy and shop with that instead!!The rides are excellent,please wear clothes and shoes which are water friendly as in many places you will get really wet and sometimes soaked. You may carry empty water bottles as there are many water dispensers to fill them up. For the elderly crowd, this may be a really tiring one as Singapore is a hot and humid place and some of the rides go really fast. There are plenty of food places around, if you are not a vegetarian then you wont find any issues with food. USS is a full day attraction and if you can spend a whole day here, I am sure you can cover all the rides and still have plenty of time to walk around for photo opportunities.

review_425964538,“A bit disappointed ”,"Landed in Singapore in the morning and headed straight here after dropping our luggage off. Entrance was fairly swift and the place was certainly buzzing. But once inside the park, we very quickly found that the choice of white knuckle rides was fairly limited. Having been to Universal in Florida, was somewhat disappointed with the choice. The cyclone roller coaster had to be the highlight although quite a short ride. And the transformers 3d ride was up there as well. The lockers system was chaos and though free at some of the rides, they were an exorbitant $4 on other rides. Definitely left a sour taste as you are almost forced by the staff to use them, even when it isn't deemed necessary. Food wise we opted for Goldilocks for the Halal option. Standard fare fried chicken and fries. $50 and we were on our way again. At the end, a 40 min wait for a taxi from a very humid basement parking area. Cheap fare and the queue moved along swiftly but it was long. Still feel it's a must do attraction but don't expect it to be on par with the US or even Alton Towers etc

It was good from that perspective and am glad that we didn't spend the extra cost of the express passes as the wait time for most rides was only about 20mins (some as short as 5mins with the longest being 1hr for the big roller coaster). Food and drinks are stupidly expensive so would suggest getting a day stamp and heading out to the Malaysian Hawker Food Street just outside the main gate to eat an the going back in.

review_425708140,“Well worth a visit.”,"Having previously visited and not enjoyed Universal Studios in Osaka Japan we were rather reluctant to try Universal Singapore. Well how wrong we were…..Learning many lessons from Japan we pre-booked our Universal Express passes and luckily for us they made a massive difference to our enjoyment.Unfortunately our daughter was unwell the day we booked (the Universal Express pass is valid for 1 day only) however we called and asked for the day to be transferred and they happily obliged. Being centrally located we took an uber there from our apartment. There are many rides and attractions to immerse your self into and we did. Our ratbag is 10 and she went on all the rides, including the brilliant Battlestar Galactica Human vs Cylon, which comprises of two different roller coasters that are an absolute must do – we did them both multiple times.Another must is Transformers The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle – it is the ultimate, in fun.And the Lights, Camera, Action, Hosted by Steven Spielberg is waaaay more exciting than the Japan version, so much better…..be prepared, if you’re in the front row on the right hand side, you will get wet…Other rides that provide a thrill a minute are:Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure – you will get wet, but only slightly…Canopy Flyer – short but sweet.Revenge of the Mummy – best ride in the whole entire park, we went 4 times and would go again…Go to all the shows and events as they do not disappoint, at all.There are many differing varieties of food for all tastes and palates that are actually tasty and not the pre-cooked and packaged slop one would expect, for once.We would highly recommend Universal Singapore but only with the Express pass, you will save sooo much time queuing.

Weekdays would definitely be recommended as queues are much shorter on such days. They added new rides from my last visit which was really cute. New rides we're themed from sesame street and puss in boots! Like the idea that lockers near the more exciting rides are available for free for certain periods of time. It also changes as according to the queue time. For example, the iconic red and blue roller coasters. Lockers we're initially free for the first 45mins. But later in the day, they we're free for the first 95 mins. This was pretty awesome for people who go in small groups. Less hassle and you don't need to exclude anyone to simply take care of the bags.

The staff at each of the rides were enthusiastic and very helpful. Given how hot the temperature can get, I think the park would benefit from having some misting stations scattered around to let you cool down.

review_425283487,“The One and Only in South East Asia”,"Universal Studio provides endless entertainment not only to the Children but the parents as well. To have the best experience, one needs to stay at one of the hotels within Sentosa island and choose one owned and operated by the Resorts World Sentosa (Festive Hotel, Hard Rock Hotel Singapore, Hotel Michael, and Equarius Hotel, Crockfords Tower, Beach Villas, Ocean Suite, TreeTop Loft, and ESPA at Resort Worlds Sentosa). When you are tired at the end of the day, you just need to crawl back to the hotel (of which if you stay outside of Sentosa, the tiredness will be double) and relieve yourself.Please do purchase your tickets online to enjoy a special discount and as a precaution to avoid long queue or to check for the operating date (sometimes public holidays do spoil your dream). And don't forget to purchase an express ticket to enjoy the non-queueing facility that Universal Studio provides. It could be miserably tiring for a long wait just to enjoy a ride. Universal Studio hosts numerous games and entertainment based on its latest movie release. And to the thrill seekers, this centre provides enough roller coasters challenge both indoor and outdoor. I particularly like the digital lockers to leave your belongings during the roller coaster rides.The souvenir shops sell variety of merchandise but please be aware that each of them sells different pattern/products/merchandise depending on the store concept and the entertainment stage next to it. For customisation (such as engraving), you can only do it at the stores located inside of the Universal Studio and none at the store outside of the Studio gate.Sentosa itself hosts lot of other attractions beside Universal Studio. You can enjoy the fish aquarium, dolphin shows, massive waterparks, cable car, beaches, golf course, and not forgetting the CASINO.

The park is issuing too many express pass and the waiting time at cyclone and Galgatta was more than 40 minutes. They did not allow to use the express pass for the canopy flyer when we visited on 03/10/2016.There should be some sort of limitations in selling express pass as they do in Universal studios Osaka.The waiting time is too much for express pass holders which is frustrating and makes the experience at the park worse.

review_425033508,“Full on - Great Day Out!! ”,"An excellent attraction on Sentosa.Plenty to see and do at Universal Studios.Needed the full 8-9 hours to see all the attractions and at least one ride on each of the rides. They offer an express pas at extra cost. We elected to not pay the extra. Friends who had visited recommended it if you're limited for time and want to ride.For waits of up to 2 hours for a 1min and 30 second ride, then it's worth the universal express pass where waiting times could be say anywhere from a couple of minutes to say 10-15minutes.After a while you do get a little frustrated to see pass holder walking via the dedicated lines past the majority to get on a ride.There are various attractions based on the:Battle star GalacticaTransformersJurassic ParkPuss n BootsSesame StreetMadagascar Dragon ExpressShrek So there is plenty on offer!Bring your wallet though. Like all good theme parks, cold drinks and food are relatively expensive.Lockers are available for patrons where gear can be left for those rides where gear cannot be taken. Lockers have some free time before a small rental is charged.Recommended for families with young children say 6 upwards. A little older and they can sort of look after themselves in terms of being able to ride independently.A lot of rides etc photos, etc cannot be taken or at least signposted as such.Full on day out, so charge those battery cells the night before!! Have fun!

As well as Shrek 4D experience & Elmo's space adventure.The Battlestar ride was epic! You can choose between two lines, & I chose the Cylon one as it was the scarier of the two. Well worth the experience! There were twists, turns & 360s even! Not for the faint of heart.Mummy returns was pretty thrilling, as the ride is mostly in the dark which adds an element of surprise to a traditional coaster-type experience. Transformers was great too, as its a POV ride where you are a character in the movie. A must for any fan!If your travelling in September - October, would advise to go in the second half of the day to catch the spooky Halloween specials.Overall great options for adults & children alike!

GOOD RANGE OF RIDES FOR SCARDEY CATS & THRILL SEEKERS”,"We had a great day out arriving just before 10am to avoid the entry queues and leaving at closing time (6pm). We booked on line to get the discounted price and to avoid the ticket office queue, and we did go with the Unlimited Express pass.It was Tuesday when we visited, so it wasn't overly busy and yes there were rides that you could walk straight onto or wait just a couple of minutes in the morning. However it was handy to have the Unlimited Express pass towards the end of the day when the kids wanted to have multiple turns on rides such as Cylon, Human, Transformers, Mummy and Jurassic Park (which for me was the best ride ... there's nothing better than a ride where you get a bit wet!!)We went with our 5yo ""scardey cat"", 9yo ""not too scarey rider"" and 11yo ""thrill seeker"" and friends who had 4 children of similar ages. We found that there was a good range of rides/attractions for all members of both families. However if you are an adrenaline junkie without kids and don't like the tame, entertainment rides (such as Its a Small World at Disneyland)you may find that you'll be hard pressed to make it a full day out unless you ride 4-5 rides over and over.The only food option we visited was Mel's Diner which is your classic burger place and prices were comparable to your regular burger place.Re the photo opportunity with your favourite characters, if there's one you really want s pic with make sure you check the schedule as the ""minders"" are very strict with adhering to the set times and you will be turned away ... sadly we missed the cute little minions!!My only minor disappointment that there wasn't the usual parade (only available weekends and public holidays) and fireworks to end the day ... just didn't quite feel right to me just finishing in a ride and walking out!

review_424143140,“Back to childhood”,"We spend there 4 hours only. I wish I could have more time, cause this place is really amazing!If you are luck of time, advice you to buy additional Express unlimited ticket (do not remember exact price, but should be around 50 S$). It is really helpful, cause lets you skip all the queres and long standing in the line.

review_424114870,“Such Fun !!”,"We went on a Tuesday so wasn't crowded much at all, as a result we were able to go on all the rides, some even multiple times. Cylon and Human were the best in the Sci-Fi city. Though Revenge of the Mummy's was the best overall - we rode this three times ! Far Far Away was great too though more for younger kids; and the lost world (jurassic park) was fun as well.

review_423820953,“Pick your day before you go ”,"We picked Friday to visit Universal Studios Singapore. We had checked the prices on Wednesday and made up our minds Friday would suit us. Prices Wednesday $74 per adult plus $30 extra if you want front of the row once, or $50 for unlimited front of the row. On Friday the prices has gone up by $20 for front of the row, so beware of the day you go. The longest wait for a ride was 30mins most of the rides you didn't have to wait at all. Save your money because you might not need to queue, you can always buy the front of the line from the shops in side. Besides the price of tickets it's still a good day out for all

review_423473749,“Adults Survival Guide to Universal Studios”,"Like me, if you're wondering whether paying for a visit to Universal Studios is worth it when you DON'T have young children, keep reading. If you're interested to get some useful tips then keen reading as well. To give you an idea, my mum and I (two adults, 30s and late 50s visited in September of 2016)1. Is it worth the $65SGD. A resounding yes. More on this discounted price later. 2. Getting there: Make sure you're at the front gate by 10am to enter. We did this and found that the first 2 hours were relatively quiet. 3. Prioritising the rides: Research the rides before you get there. As I mentioned earlier, the first 2 hours are relatively quiet but in saying that you'll still have to queue. The best rides in order are: Transformers, Battestar Gallatica CYLON, The Mummy, Battlestar Jurrasic Park Rapids (you will get wet), Battlestar Gallatica Human. This is just my opinion as an adult. There were others there but they are more geared at children so we didn't go. 4. Do most of the rides BEFORE the afternoon: At 1:30pm there is an unmissable Waterworld Show at Lost Worlds that goes for 30 minutes. This show including its stunt actors were amazing and you should definitely try to get there. 5. FREE lockers: There were free lockers for both Battlestar rides. You MUST have all your stuff in these lockers before the ride otherwise there are lockers just before you get on. These lockers are free for the first hour and so when you place your valuables into these lockers, my advice would be to queue up for the Battlestar CYLON and then Battlestar Human. They are next to one another. 6. NOT FREE lockers: There was another locker bay for your valuables near the Jurrasic Park Rapids. These were NOT free and we found out after that it wasn't compulsory to store you valuables in there before the ride. If you're not afraid that your stuff might get a little damp then just take it on the boat ride with you. There were plenty of bags and backpacks on the boats when we went. The price of the lockers was $4SGD. Not a lot but they should have told us that it wasn't compulsory. 7. Breakfast: Have a big breakfast early but give yourself a couple of hours to digest before going on the rides mentioned above; some people may feel nauseous. 8. Express Pass: Reading previous reviews I know people are divided on these passes. We decided NOT to get them and see how we went. As we attended Universal Studio on a weekday (Thursday) we thought it would be okay and in the end it was. The longest that we had to wait was for the first and definitely most popular Transformers ride (30min wait) but the others varied from 2mins - 25mins. I know this sounds like a lot of waiting around but nearly all these queues were undercover/inside with strong airconditioning so it's definitely doable. Yes, it was a little envious to watch others with Express Passes stroll through without lining up but I enjoyed conversation with my mum while in the queue. Also, it's part of the theme park experience I believe. 9. Food: As previously mentioned, have a big breakfast. This should get you through to 1:00pm at least. Food prices were expensive, but not outrageous compared to other theme parks; $12SGD for a hotdog and $4 for a bottle of Coke just to give you an idea. We didn't buy any food, only drinks but if you do get hungry, bring some snacks. They do check bags before entry but I didn't see anyone take away people's snacks. 10. Photos: Around the park there will be strategically placed life size figurines of characters such as Sesame Street characters, Madagascar characters, Optimus Prime, Minions etc. with photographers placed in front of them. They want you to stand in front so they can take a photo. Depending on how you feel about this, stand in front of the figurines and let the photographer take your photo, however also ask them to take a few shots with your own camera (they will all agree to do this for you). Then go and view the photos that the photographers have take and if you really love the images and would like to buy then go ahead however if not, then you've got some images on your own camera that they have taken for you. The cost for these photos to be purchased is $25SGD, which is the most priciest non value for money item in the park. 11. Photos at the front: When you first arrive at Universal Studios, there will be a VERY STRONG URGE to take a photo in front of the iconic revolving Universal Studios globe. Fight this urge as best as you can and just go into the park to enjoy the day. Before the park opens, there are hordes of people trying to do the exact same thing. What this means is that its almost impossible to get a good picture without someone being in the shot. Wait until after you have left the park to take the photo. When we left at 3:30pm, it was A LOT easier to take a good shot. 12. Hats & sunscreen: Bring a hat, comfortable shoes (preferably sandals and not thongs/flip flops because for the rollercoasters they'll make you take them off as it can fall off) and sunscreen if you're fair skinned. You'll be walking around a lot during the day. I had my Fitbit on during our visit and we walked approximately 12,000 steps. 13. Discount tickets: As mentioned earlier, we didn't pay the $74SGD cost of the park. We stayed at the Wangz Hotel (another review that I'll write) later and they had a Handy phone which allowed guests to purchased discounted rate tickets so we paid $65 plus there was another $2 discount so all up it was $63 per person and based on what we experienced, it was definitely worth it. 14. Have a good attitude: You're at a theme park in SE Asia. It will be hot, there will be foreign people speaking different languages, there will be kids and queues. I think if you go in with these expectations then you'll have a realistic and good time. On the upside, the staff are efficient and polite, there were clean restrooms within a few steps of each other, the park was stroller friendly and the atmosphere was upbeat and lively. 15. Water: If you're really on a budget and don't want to spend any money on food or drinks then make sure that you at least have an empty water bottle. It gets really hot so you'll need water to stay hydrated and there are plenty of water refill stations around as well. Overall, if you've read up to now; it should be clear that my opinion is to definitely go. We entered to park at 10:00am and left by 3:30pm having thoroughly enjoyed ourselves as two adults. I think that even if you've got children, spending close to 6hrs here is enough as it ensures that even children don't become overly tired. Hopefully the tips above have been useful. So, take that trip back to your childhood and enjoy the experience!

review_423444642,“Absolutely top class!”,"We visited the universal studios singapore at the end of the last month & had a great day. There are seven movie-themed zones, and each is uniquely designed. Since we were visiting the park along with my 4 yr old son we ensured that we did all the child friendly attractions. This theme park is suitable for all ages. Only make sure that if you are travelling with toddlers get a stroller along for the child to sit in as there is a lot of walking to do. You need to leave the strollers outside the rides at designated stroller areas. All rides have height restrictions for children & make sure to check them before standing in the queue.My son enjoyed the Madagascar ride, Jurassic Park rapids, spaghetti Chase & Shrek castle the most.The transformers ride & Jurassic Rapids have the longest waiting times (45- 75mins). It is advisable to purchase the express tickets as this will save a lot time. The entry to park starts at 10 am & most visitors head straight to the transformers ride which is located close to the entrance, so it is a good idea to do the other rides first & visit this later as it is less crowded during the late afternoon.Make sure to schedule an entire day at Universal studios.

All of the staff on the rides were great and the people escorting the characters were only too happy to take our photos.A tip if you want character photos is to watch the little shows they put on in the streets as they allow you to have your photo taken with the characters at the end of the show. This worked well as we were after specific characters eg the Cookie Monster.We got our tickets from a travel agent in China Town for $60 which was a huge saving. We went without kids and it was fantastic.

review_423368668,“Must visit!”,"USS is a must visit if you are in Singapore even on a short trip only, allocate an entire day since you could spend ages waiting in line for your turn in the rides. And I should mention that USS is all about rides. Rides and rides and sorts of it. If you are a person who isnt fond or hate those kind of stuff (like my companion) then I suggest to better spend your bucks somewhere else.You might want to take advantage of promos you can avail online, as well as discounts from hotels and other travel agencies.Bring a water bottle so that you can just have it refilled at the drinking fountains.

review_423097216,“Singapore is really incomplete without Universal Studios”,"It is one of the best place to spend your money. I got my ticket from an agent in the China Town @S$60 and after that express unlimeted pass @S$50. The express pass it's really worth it. I hardly had to stand for 3 mins for a ride. But felt very bad for the normal riders because the crew members are giving priority to the express pass holders much like if they are allowing 4 express holders then against that they are leaving only for 1 normal pass holders. It looked a bit weird to me. And the persons who had not availed their express pass had to stand atleast 30 mins. The sci-fic city has really got a bunch of stuffs like the transformers, cyclone and all. The water park, mummy are also good. But I will suggest to everyone who is opting for express pass to start with Madagascar and far fairy land because the rides in sci-fic city will give u a lot of enjoyment cum it will rip all of your energy. I felt like vomiting when I got off from the cyclone. and I actually ruined my next rides pretty much. Hope to visit again if I come to Singapore next year.

You can only use it once on each ride but between 4-6pm there is hardly much time to wait.Otherwise it was a bit boring with all the gimmick shops. I liked the sound effects show to.

review_422589680,“Better than expected!”,"Although I'd already purchased a Senior's pass, I didn't know then, that my TA had sorted a stopover pass in Singapore that included free admission! That meant that I went twice.Of course it isn't as large as Florida or LA, but way, way cheaper and good value. On our first visit, 6 years ago, we walked out before riding anything due to torrential rain - but Singapore's weather can change in an instant, so be prepared.This time, it was a solo visit and often, being a single rider has advantages. On the transformer ride, I waited over an hour in the single rider's queue, as they only use singles to fill in a vacant seat in the 12 seater 'pods'. The staff running this ride need to be aware and realise that maybe putting 12 singles on a pod every now and again would have a huge impact on the queue, which I suspect was much longer time-wise than the general queue.The entertainment guys doing the break dancing in the covered street had the volume up so high that it hurt the ears and was totally unnecessary.Unlike most theme park food outlets, I found the curry on sale opposite the Mummy ride to be fantastic value and extremely tasty, so much so that I ate there both days!There are one or two rides here that you won't find in LA so the parks are different. The Shrek 4D movie is always a pleasant experience and a chance to sit down.What did surprise me however was that immediately outside the park gate is a 'food street' where an authentic main dish was under $10.Well worth a visit and a senior pass at $36, brilliant value. Although many seniors may be with grandchildren, some do ride! Pity Disney and Universal in LA don't offer a discount.

You have to purchase an express pass to skip straight to the queue - don't hesitate, just budget it in if you really want to enjoy the day.

review_422469408,“You are sure to return one day”,"Recommend an early breakfast in your Singapore downtown hotel and getting to Universal studios on opening at 10am. Getting there is optional by the Mount Faber cable car, Sentosa express or bus/car. Plan on a good 7-8 hour day. A whole day at Universal is needed to get maximum benefit. We like the 2 day fun pass Sentosa Island attractions on Day 1 and Universal Studios on Day 2. There is plenty to enjoy and we tried most things. Queuing time was short and averaged 5 to 15 mins for the main attractions like the roller coaster rides. Everything is well done and suitable for all the family.

You might struggle with younger children due to the heat and just the pure excitement of it all for them. It's expensive, but the same any where in the world for such a tourist trap right!!!!!

Entrance ticket is 74 SGD which allows all rides for free, however there are 2 lines for general and others for priority which will take less time for a ride especially when you see the long lines in general. There is an additional ticket if you pay another SGD 75 you will be allowed for priority with unlimited access per individual. Best time to go there is first thing in the morning, inside food is expensive but affordable. You will plenty of shops to buy some stuff for kids and the price range starts from 15 SGD and reasonably it may go above 35 SGD for general bags and toys etc. For this attraction you may spent more than 6 hours so it is a day tour to plan. if you are traveller then suggest going on working days to avoid weekend visitors.

review_422375472,“Good fun - and a manageable size”,"Spent a day here with the kids at the end of our Summer holidays. We decided to visit on a Monday after reading about the queues, and hoped that it wouldn't be too bad. In fact, we arrived before opening and it was quiet for the first hour or so, which enabled us to get a few of the 'bigger' rides in. However, bear in mind that the Jurassic Park area doesn't open until later...Good rides and the queues did build up during the morning to the point that we bought an express pass. This we quite expensive (more than the price of admission, but for a one-off visit we bit the bullet. On balance, we probably did the right thing, although the queues did vary a lot from ride to ride, and the time estimates were sometimes wildly inaccurate - stating 50 mins wait outside when only a 10-minute wait in reality.Otherwise, a very good day out and we managed to go on all of the rides - most of them 2 or 3 times, especially as it got much quieter during the late afternoon.Food selections were good - and prices as you would expect for a theme park. We missed most of the shows, as our teenage kids preferred the rides, but there did seem to be a lot going on - so a full day needed probably for most people.

Unfortunately (or fortunately) for us, we had been to the one in LA prior to this trip. We couldn't help drawing comparisons between the two. The US version is much larger, with a lot more attractions. Having said that, we enjoyed ourselves. The only real downside is waiting to get in. It's ""organized chaos"" - at best! In summary, if you haven't been to the USA, I think you'll have a great time. Make sure you go on the Transformer Ride...it's Fantastic!

review_422260370,“Great fun for everyone!!”,"We visited on a Friday expecting maximum crowds and with the view to buy the express pass. $70 each seemed a lot to us so when we were advised that you can purchase them at any time in the park we decided to wait. We are glad we did. Maximum wait time we saw was 50 mins at peak midday time. Rides that we loved:Mummy rideMadagascar cart rideJurassic Park RapidsJurassic park canopyTransformers rideShrek 4D Lights camera actionGreat fun for everyone, happy we did not have to buy the express pass with only 5-15 minute wait on the day. Our tip - stay till the end, lines end up at 5 mins and you get to go back on all your favourites!

review_422064028,“So much fun”,"Great family outing. Not cheap, but worth it. And the express pass is definitely worth the extra cost, as it saved us hours of queuing. Beware for larger folks, some of the rides are built for smaller people. But many are usuable by all sizes, and so much fun. Our favorite was Transformers, despite not being a fan of the movies.

review_422043127,“Great VIP tour”,"Just had a wonderful VIP tour at USS. Our guide, Halik, was incredibly engaging, efficient and appropriately generous with his advice on what we would enjoy and why. He was always spot on. Our 3 young kids loved him and loved the park. Even though the park was fairly quiet our ability to go straight to the front of the line allowed us to cover all attractions over a 6 hour period. I don't think we would have got everything in even with an express pass. The one on one photo ops with the characters made the kids day. I know this is an expensive option but as a rare event for us we thought it was fair value. Alex from Madagascar photo bombed one of our shots!

review_422020438,“Great place to spend the whole days with the kids”,"We decided to celebrate Janelle's birthday with a full day in USS. It helped with 10% discount promotion through MasterCard. If you intend to do many rides, worth getting the Universal Unlimited Pass @$70 instead of $50 for one per ride. Janelle did Madagascar 3X, Puss in Boots 2X, Jurassic River ride 5X (!), Mummy 3X, Transformer 3X. Food is not that great in the premise but you don't have much choice.

The staff are wonderful and want you to have a great time.It appears as though the busiest ride is the rapids ride in jurrassic park. It opens later at 11. I would be there at 11 unless you have an express pass.The meals werent as expensive as i thought. $10 for a plain hotdog chips and drink ( kids meal) Both battlestar galactica rides are popular so do them early too. Transformers ride was not that busy today. It is the best ride. The mummy ride was good. We had an awesome day. Need to do air conditioned things in the middle of the day . It gets hot at the waterworld show, you get most wet in the middle section and to the left. This is a good time to visit .

Reaching the studio is easy but a little crowded and queues might take your time, better to take a shuttle to reach Sentosa island instead of metro/train.The must experience rides other than the big roller coaster is - Transformers, The Mummy (A must must must go ride) and Jurassic park. The Jurassic park ride has a very long queue so you need to plan accordingly. There are lot of other things which both kids and adults can enjoy. Shrek 4D show is also entertaining and keeps your mood light and happy. If you are planning to visit Singapore, do keep universal studios on top of your Things to do list

We went on almost every ride being in our 20's we enjoyed nearly all of them. Obviously some are more child friendly which is gread for family's. The park is so clean and tidy much like Singapore itself. We went on the transformer ride 3 times which was a thriller. The mummy rollercoaster was also a must for the thrillseekers.

review_420690994,“For kids of all ages”,"We pre-purchased our tickets from the Chintatown Visitors Centre as it was cheaper. We paid S$68 each adult for admission. On arrival you have options to upgrade - you can pay an extra $50 per adult for an Express Pass - which allows you to jump to the front of the queue ONCE for each ride or pay $70 per adult for an Unlimited Express Pass - which allows you to jump to the front of the queue ALL the time. We opted for the Express Pass which was perfect for our needs.We arrived early (10am opening) and headed in the opposite direction to the crowds. We didn't use our Express Pass on the first few rides as the queues were not bad at all! As the day wore on, the lines got longer, although we must have been in a quiet time as they were never more than 30 minutes. So we used our pass in the afternoon.It is rather compact but they amazingly fit so many themed areas and rides. We stayed until closing (6pm in the quiet time). I don't do the big scary rides but my husband did and was more than thrilled. I loved all the theme rides and had a great time too. Many options for food and drink.Of course it is not as huge as the American Universal Studios but well worth the visit, in a great location and combined with so many other things to do in the area.

Park is so well organised. It was a pleasure to visit. Good amount of shade, water fountains, clean toilets. Staff were so friendly, and helpful.We had an amazing lunch at Kt Grill. My son has food allergies, and staff fully understood what I was requesting for him. My sons steak was the best meal we have had on our trip so far. He wants to go back just for another lunch!The Transformer is a MUST!!! The most amazing ride I've ever been on. All the roller boasters though are not to be missed.A lot of lockers are free for 45mins, which was fantastic. As our family of 4 went on all rides together, and the lockers were a huge help in allowing us to do this.Street shows were also very cool. The American dance group were great to watch,Fiends had advised us to buy the jump the queue pass - fortunately today it just wasn't needed.Great day, and strongly recommend for all ages.Universal Studios weren't here on our last visit to Singapore - so glad it's here now, a great addition to the beautiful Sentosa Island.

Also, whoever does the voice of Donkey in the live comedy show is spot-on and awesome! The thing I least liked? I really didn't like lining up for those rides that required the use of fingerprint based storage lockers; hope they changed that in the future.We came into Universal Studio at noon on Friday with an unlimited Express Pass and was able to get on most of the attractions available before 6 PM. Unfortunately, there were glitches on few of the attractions, so that caused us to miss out on a few. Express Pass definitely seemed worth it, as we only waited at most 5 to 10 minutes per attraction, where the standard line could range from 20 to 100+ minutes.

The (only) two rides that allow 3-5 year old children are not part of the fast pass.We queued for another two rides and were allowed to go and stand in the line and 30 mins later, 30 degrees that felt like 40, the staff at the end of the line told me i cant get on the ride unless i leave my waist bag. I could have easily left it and got on with it but the way i was told about this just made me regret this as i wasted a day in that place and literally did nothing for the cost of 340 SGD.I learned the hard way i guess...

We immediately joined the 45 min queue for Cylon roller coaster, and not long afterwards the waiting time leapt to 90 min for people behind us. The roller coaster ride was epic! The park got so busy it was unpleasant. We really recommend the Express tickets to reduce waiting time by half. We also found the displayed waiting times were hugely inaccurate and underestimated the wait time significantly - not something we expected in Singapore. The heat and humidity were absolute killers and with all the crowds I advise you think carefully before taking little kids. I am sure it would be better on off-off-peak times.

There is a Starbucks Cafe to sit a while as kids made use of priority pass.Was a 45 min wait for train back to Vivo City and MRT. Opt for the broadwalk which takes you direct to Vivocity.

review_419773039,“Bestfriend date to remember”,"As much as I love exploring and taking challenges, I am not that strong enough to conquer such extreme rides like Galactica's Human and Cylon and to add the extreme darkness of The Mummy. Its definitely a shoutout or should I say an endless screaaaaaaaaaam! (Though I don't really scream, haha because I close my eyes and kept quiet in these kind of rides.)Its fun in here! If you're not a fan of rides, there are other things to do in USS like watch the shows with their timetable which you can found on the rack of map and if not, you can roam around and just be like a kid who always like to go to such amusement to be amaze. If you get hungry? No worries, there are food stall in there, foodcourt and a bistro. There are souvenir shops too in each ride which you can just enter anytime without queue. But... little reminder for everyone, its a bit costly inside.

review_419759058,"“Limited attractions, very long queues...”","Having been to the Universal Studios in Florida, my family went to the one in Singapore in August 2016 with reservations.We booked our visit through one of the agents in Singapore. We were fetch from our hotel but since we were not just their customer, the bus went around a few hotels to fetch other customers. And then we were dropped at the Gardens by the Bay and were made to endure another 30minute wait for another coach to get us to Universal Studios.Universal Studios in Singapore is small and was quite busy throughout the day. We bought express pass (which doubled what we have paid) to avoid the queue but the pass is not for all attractions. So in some of the attractions, we still have to bear the very long queue in searing tropical heat.Being a small place, as expected, there are fewer attractions. And fewer attractions meant longer queues. To be fair, big fans were provided at the queue to cool you off. Still you need lots of water not to get dehydrated.At the end of the day, we have to look for our own transport as it's not part of the packaged tour. So we took a private van to take us back to the hotel for a flat rate of $50. Of course there is another option, a public bus or cab with very long queue.In summary, our experience was not that great I must say, compared to the one in Florida. You need to spend the whole day to try all the attractions. However, it's still not a guarantee that you would be able to get into all of them... because of long queues. I would recommend that you book your tickets online rather than going through an agent. Get a cab or a private van to the resort and back to avoid wasting your time. And most of all, bring lots of money to spend especially if you have got children.

review_419746445,“Tina”,"This review may be helpful for older couples (50~65ish). My recollection of Universal Studios in LA was of movie sets and special effects and an appreciation for movie making. Singapore Universal Studios is mainly a theme park with rides. The lay out of various areas is creative, but mainly focussed on expensive eateries and mechandising. We enjoyed the shows, but it was limited. Waterworld is fun, but it has been around for a few decades.

Was a very pleasant visit, seeing (and taking photos with) the Penguins of Madagascar, the minions and others. Good for kids of many ages, although some of the attractions have minimum height requirements of 80 to 100 cm. Entrance price for a normal ticket was about 76 SGD for adults and about 58 for kids (don't have the exact number in mind anymore). Family liked it very much.

review_419391821,“Small but perfectly formed”,"Alot smaller that we were expecting but it was a good way to spend a few hours. We pre-purchased Express Unlimited tickets and got there at opening time. Was really quiet and had no wait getting in or on any of the rides. First stop was Transformers 3D which was totally fab. We ended up going on 4 times throughout the day. Totally spoilt the rest of the rides though which couldn't compete. Jurassic Park rapids was OK but a bit dated - and wet !. The Mummy was the same - a bit dated and not particularly exciting. Battlestar Gallatica is a non-starter if you are even a slightly larger person. Luckily didn't wait in line due to having express pass but when the overhead seat lock didn't fit it was embarrassing - more than 1 person had to leave the ride. Why they don't mention this before climbing up to the ride I do not know. Would be gutting if you had to queue for ages then couldn't get on. I imagine the ones in the USA are built for the bigger person. The Waterworld show was good fun and alot of energy by the performers. Only on twice on the Saturday we went so be sure to check the show timings. Lights, Camera, Action was interesting to see how the films create a hurricane on a stage set. Can't comment on the kids rides. Overall USS is worth a visit and worth buying an express ticket as it got much busier as the day went on.

If you can splash for an express i'd recommend it, Q for the pass were about 10-25 minutes on all rides. Transformers, The Mummy and Jurassic park rappids are a must. Don't understand the locker system think its ridiculous, some rides you can take your bag some you cant, then you have to pay for a locker, but you don't know how long you need for one ride! It seems a bit of a money making scheme when its pricey to enter already. And more Qs. If you have small children i would definitely make sure you measure them before you Q, evey ride there was a family that got turned away for children being to small, you can measure them at the entrance, this will save you time and a lot of disappointment!

review_418679686,“Much nicer for younger kids than the California one”,"We have been to the one in LA a few times but this one is so much nicer for younger kids, we have a 6 yr old and he had a blast. Still lots of coasters for the teens and adults, just nice to have so much more for the younger kids. Lots More. Super clean, super nice staff, the wait times posted were absolutely accurate and amazed at all the cover available for any intense sun or unexpected rain. Its rare I would still say something could be enjoyed if it rained but this is the exception IF you are taking younger to elementary age kids, the coasters would probably shut down, but that would still leave Transformers and Mummy if it was just a passing shower. We had flawless weather but I still enjoyed all the shade covering, and it was not as Loud as ours here in California. I truly wish we could copy theirs. The Water World show is outstanding. Just a great day and even better- a great price. Easily reached at the end of the Sentosa walkway or take the SWR8 bus (only $1) from in front of the Vivo mall and take the escalator up near the McDonalds and you will be close. If you are there when it opens, lines are almost non-existent, most head to the biggest events- like Transformers, we barely waited 10 minutes.

review_418669172,“Worth visit but need proper planning”,"Worth visit. Many many rides and shows are there. If you want to do all in a single day, it is nearly impossible because of long queue everywhere. Please collect the map first and choose what to do and what not. For families with kids and aged person, please do not head for big roller coasters like me. The staffs are very helpful and polite in behavior. From my experience, excluding two big roller coaster the rating from the best is as follows: body of works show (3.30 pm) > madagascar > lost world (rafting), canopy nothing special > Hollywood (special effects show). A lot more are there, but these are the best. Advice 1: Small baby (below 92 cm or in some cases below 122 cm) are not allowed in any ride. Family person should not visit Universal studio until your baby reaches a certain height. I have gone through their website. But this is not mentioned anywhere. Or if mentioned then also NOT very easily noticeable. Many families I have seen just sitting inside with either of parents. My friend had two kids, one could go for rides and the other was small who could not. So either my friend or his wife had to sacrifice some rides. The website should clearly mention this thing.Advice 2: Bring foods/drinks/mineral water with you. Everything is very very expansive inside the park.Advice 3: Be prepared for long long queue at most of the good rides.

And till now I love to come here with my friends, family or even alone. Coming from one attraction to another: Madagaskar, Shreck, Mummy, Jurassic Park, Transformers, movies of Steven Spielberg, Sesam Street - gives you a feeling of being a part of a fairy tale! A lot of cafes and souvenir shops bring you very festive feelings! Depending on your preferences, you can choose different rides, from the most mild ones as Madagaskar, Sesame Street and Jurassic Park to the most scary ones as Mummy Ride and Battlestar Galactica - the highest dueling roller coaster in the world. It's very crowded during the weekend and public holidays, so better to come during the weekday or later in the day when the most crowd is gone. During weekend and special dates the Park usually have a Hollywood Parade - it's a very nice carnival of the park characters, try to catch it! And in the evening before the closure is the Firework, similar to the one you see in Disney Cartoons. Check the schedule of the shows on RWS website! Nice place, definitely must go on Singapore!

review_418278917,“Did the job....”,"Took the kids, again.... Usual thing. Expensive, tacky etc but the kids love it. It is not as busy as the US theme parks and a lot smaller. I always think the US parks 'work' somehow because of the vibe, the regular parades, music and dance shows etc which are always of high quality. To be fair a couple of singing groups came out to entertain the crowds. I guess the demographic is just different. I felt quite sorry for the groups which sang their hearts out to a small crowd of confused looking tourists! Rides are good of course. Realistically battle star galactica and the mummy ride (possibly transformers) are the only ones which are really high octane. My personal strategy is to buy the express ticket which which allows one queue jump per ride. This gets you to the front of the queue at the main gate. Get there around 9:30-9:45. Go straight to battle star galactica, mummy and transformers. Note the blue battle star galactica run is much more aggressive than the red one but they we counted as separate rides. Do as many as these as you can without using your express ticket. Wonder off and do some lighter weight things - maybe take in the waterworld show etc. come back when the queues are around an hour and go straight to the front of the queue. You can then legitimately tell the kids that they can't do the ride again...

review_418253463,“Fun day out though crowded”,"Brought two kids of 3 and 7 to Universal Studios Singapore on the first day of the week long school holidays. Park was pretty crowded with the peak probably at about noon to two. From rope-up time at 10AM, the more junior rides on the left hand side past Hollywood Boulevard did not require too much waiting. Close to noon most rides required 30 minutes of waiting or more. The Waterworld Show was fabulous with lots of crowd engagement (performers pranked audience volunteers even!) before the show started, though younger kids might be a little startled or scared from the pyrotechnics. The New York: Sesame Street: When I Grow Up show is also worth attending if your kids love the characters from it. In all, plan for at least 5 hours to walk through the park and also cover maybe half of the rides without long queues. You'd need a much longer visit if you want to try the popular roller-coaster rides too. Funnily, friends who went to the same park the following day of that week (a Tuesday) observed much shorter queues.

Buying a Fast Track ticket is the best option for all of the family but makes the cost of the day double than a standard entry. Once inside, you also find that fast track is not relevant for all rides and even on some of the more popular rides waiting time can be in excess of 40 minutes on a weekday. It is a great experience and for the kids there are a number of very good rides that they will want to go on repeatedly e.g. Sesame Space Ride where my kids went on 10 times in a row through fast track.There are plenty of places to eat and drink as well as the numerous outlets to buy merchandise which can make this a costly day out if you have kids who want to buy whatever they see.

review_417801210,“Interesting outing especially for children”,"At the very outset, let me say that if you have seen the Universal Studios in Los Angeles (LA), the Singapore one may be a bit of a disappointment in terms of the shows and exhibits.We were a group of eight senior citizens and had planned only for about 6 hours.Unfortunately, at the first show (The Transformers), we had to wait in a snail paced queue for an hour and and a half for a ten minute show which in itself was exceedingly interesting with plenty of simulated action which felt extremely real. A negative feedback is that there is no sitting arrangements whatsoever for senior citizens during this entire 90 minute long queue in which we must have moved about 600-700 metres.Another interesting ride (this time real) was at the Jurassic Park where we floated down a narrow water body complete with rapids, etc., and concluding with a sudden unexpected heart stopping vertical drop. At some of the bends of the water body, there were life sized replicas of the various inhabitants of the Jurassic Park with real sounding roars. Yes, all, especially children will love it. (similar to the one in LA which I felt was better).The Water World was yet another interesting show which will be loved by children - complete with speed boats, shooting, action in the water, etc. Again, a copy of the show in LA.You need two days if you want to experience all the shows including the roller coasters.Go for it.

review_417764367,“Only a few rides worth going for!”,"This theme park is quite small as compared to others around the world considering how small Singapore is. There are rides for Madagascar, Shrek, Jurassic Park, The Mummy, Battlestar Galatica and Transformers. The best rides would be Cylon on Battlestar, followed by Human on Battlestar then Mummy. Mummy is thrilling cause you hit a wall at one point and you move backwards but the ride itself is very very short and in pitch darkness so you dont see anything. The Universal Express pass cannot be used for Jurassic Park's Canopy Flyover and I find this extremely annoying. Guests buy the Express Pass to cut down on waiting time but it seems like you can't do it for Canopdy Flyover when the waiting time is usually more than 45mins. Also, we noticed that Express Passes and Unlimited Express Passes were sold everywhere around the park. That explains why we had to wait 3 rounds for Battlestar despite being on the Express Pass. In the end, those without the Express Pass made it earlier than we did. What a bummer! Waterworld is just an act which has two shows per day so catch them (last one is 330pm) before it closes. Given that we can't use Express pass on one ride and that people without Express passes could be even faster than we were, I highly doubt the purpose of buying them. Even if you do need it, you could get them easily around the park without having to buy online. That way you can assess the situation and decide if you want to spend that extra bit.

review_417754042,“For ride thrill seekers”,"It's good for young thrill seekers though there are some other rides for children but most of it are all speed-rides. You need a full day to experience every rides and attractions inside USS. Express tickets are advisable if there are a lot of people because it would take 50 mins to 1 hr for the waiting time of a single ride. Imagine waiting there for few hours just to get 1 ride.

We didn't worry about the express pass and the only one wait of around 30 minutes was the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure all the rest were around 10-15 at most. Our favourite was the Transformers ride which was great and I thought better than the Battlestar rides. We also enjoyed the Shrek 4d. Food was average at the lost world. It doesn't come keep for entry but there is a lot to do to make it worthwhile and value for money.

It was so obvious that people were having fun, especially the kids.But quite frankly, I would much more enjoy a walk through a park or along the beach front than suffer all the razzmatazz here.

review_417080318,"“Overated, over-priced way to seek thrills”","Concept for some rides have not changed from 30 years ago- you sit in a boat/vehicle which brings you along a canal/track to see mechanised tired rubberized/plasticized and stiff replicas of movie/animal characters with soundtracks and spotlights that turn on and off as programmed.A camera takes pictures of your group and you are encouraged to fork out exorbitant amounts of money for that momento. Ok to visit if you have never been to theme parks elsewhere, and you seek the thrill of roller coasters. For those with young children and middle age to elderly folks- better off giving this park a miss.

review_416053044,“A full day of fun for everyone”,"This is the second time I visited Universal Studios Singapore (USS). The last time was last year and both times with my family including our toddlers. Before entering the park, it's a must to take a photograph at the iconic globe just outside the entrance. Do note that it can be quite crowded at times so do find a good spot so as to minimise photo bombs. Entering the park is a breeze as there is an entrance for families with young children. For those that did not bring their prams, you can rent one from the customer service inside the park at a fee and it can accommodate 2 kids easily. Raincovers can also be rented. Those visiting in their birthday month with the RWS membership card can also redeem a birthday gift.The park itself is of reasonable size, probably comparable to that of HK Disney land. Do take a map to study the meet the characters timing if your intention is to take photos with your favourite characters. Note that some rides have minimum height. So those below 90cm (if I remember correctly) may have limited choices. Food outlets can be found at every theme corner and they serve different cuisines. It's good to look around as the souvenirs also varies from restaurant to restaurant. Every set meal is about $15 including a drink.Overall it's a good place for a full day of family fun so it's good to go early so as to allocate sufficient time to queue up for the rides. Weekdays are recommended to avoid the crowd which may dampen the experience.

review_415544787,“Express Ticket Scam erodes Visitor Experience!”,"I really like amusement parks, particularly Roller Coasters and Theme rides. What I don't appreciate is the priority Express passes that give wealthier patrons a way to bypass lines delaying indefinitely those who wait in the ""slow lane!""The extra cost for a limited Express pass is $30. The extra cost for an unlimited Express pass is $50. This is on top of the General Admission cost of $74. I witnessed the staff seating patrons exclusively from the Express line whenever there was somebody in that line. That meant that the regular line didn't seat anyone for about an hour leading up to a severe weather delay. We only got on the Roller Coaster because there was no one in the Express line when the weather cleared. This tiered approach is nothing more than price gouging. The park is well designed and has something for all ages. For our group we enjoyed Revenge of the Mummies (Best ride with no computer 3D graphics), Jurrassic Park Rapids boat ride, and Transformers. Transformers relied on too much 3D projection and not enough on hard design assets and unfortunately represents a lower quality investment by Universal that cheapens the ride into just a rocking theatre experience as opposed to a real amusement ride.Disney does all of this way better than Universal Studios!For Singapore this is a worthy excursion and a real treat in Asia.

review_414397053,“Good for Everyone but not Cheap Entertainment”,"Visited USS again on 3 Sep 16. Entrance ticket is ar SGD74/- each. As its hot and humid, it does help that the eateries in USS are air-conditioned. However, the prices of the food are on the high side even though the taste was average. For instance a coke cost SGD3.50/-. There are also plenty of shaded areas for visitors to take a break.Noted that it was not as crowded as the previous time we went more than 1-2 years back. Nonetheless, min. waiting time for the more popular rides (Transformers, Minion, Puss, etc) still takes at least 45-60 mins. So, if you want to try all the rides and enjoy the shows, its better to go express lane and plan well.I've visited Universal Studios Osako in 2006 and Orlando in 2013, the one in Orlando is the best as its big and has more rides.Nevertheless, USS is the best there is in Asean and is a good theme to keep the whole family (young and old) entertained.Lastly, for those who are into Pokemon, there are also lots to catch in USS.

We were with our 2 year old kid who cannot go to most of the rides. One of us had to be with him all the time. This proved to be a blessing in disguise for us as there is a ""Single rider"" row is all of these rides. Universal is a very very crowded attraction and sometimes it could take 60-80 minutes for you to enjoy one ride. With single rider row we finished almost all major rides in no-time. The only rides which took the maximum time were Roller Coasters in Scifi. We liked the Transformers and Mummy ride to be the best. Transformers ride is a truly genius and its an amazing experience. Because of Halloween preparations the studious were getting closed an hour earlier than the normal time which we felt is unfair to the visitors. We had planned our day as per 8 PM closure and no-where they have informed that it will be a 7PM closure. So it should be taken care.

review_414117237,“Very Crowded and Expensive”,"Was there in middle of Aug with Family. We decided to go on Monday hoping to see this place less crowded but that was not the case. The minimum wait on any of the ride was min 60min. There were two/three rides which became non operational during the day increasing the time to get on those. We had reached there at 11:00 and could not cover all of it.. make sure you enter early to cover everything.The Transformers Ride was the best I would say, so in no case miss it. You would have lot of souvenirs shops to take some good stuff back.

review_413945891,“Lovely Getaway”,"Buy the One-Day Pass at Universal Studio online. Ours was included in our package.Go for Single Rider, fast and convenient express Lane without extra cost.Bags can be carried on most of the rides except the roller coasters. You can leave your belongings in lockers, conveniently located near the roller coaster attractions and that will be free of charge for the first 30 mins. You can open the locker and then again immediately take another locker for another half an hour which is okay. The rides, especially Transformers, Battlestar and Revenge of the Mummy are quite close by, so you can leave your things there without worrying about the time limit and hop from ride to ride if there are no queues. Toilets are wonderfully clean and always filled with soap and tissue paper to wipe your hands.There are also plenty of drinking water fountains located throughout the park, especially in the waiting areas of each attraction, so it's not necessary to bring your own water or spend a lot of money to stay hydrated. Very thoughtful. • Immerse Yourself in Seven Zoneso Hollywoodo New Yorko Sci-Fi City™o Ancient Egypto The Lost World™o Far Far Awayo Madagascar2-New YorkLights, Camera, Action! Hosted by Steven Spielberg - It’s only 10mins, so do hop on by.3-Sci-fi CityBattlestar Galactica: Cylon - the most awesome ride in the whole theme park, sit in the front, on the sides. (Each row sits 4.). This ride launches you straight into the fast speeds and turbulent turns. Although you may want to keep your glasses in the locker because they may fall off during some of the fast swoops and turns. Cylon is more traumatic, human is somewhat smoother than Cylon. Try once in both. Cylon is blue track, the red one is human.Transformers The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle – You can bring your stuff with you; just put it on the floor of the car beside you on the seat. Each car thingy has three rows, 4-Ancient EgyptRevenge of the Mummy - sit in front. Once again you aren’t allowed to bring your bags with you, because it can get quite jerky oh it suddenly just goes down on the roller coaster. 5-Lost WorldWaterWorld - I would recommend sitting in the middle sections because you’d have an unblocked view. If you don’t want to get wet, sit in the seats above the railings in the middle of the rows. Beware of seating too close to the front section, you are very likely to be wet. There are three well marked zones in the seating area. The blue ones closest to the stage are the soak zone, the green ones away from the stage are the spray zone, and the red ones further away are the dry zone. So if you are sitting in the blue seats, be prepared to be soaked mercilessly.Jurrasic Park - Do be warned that if you sit at the sides you’ll get drenched. Other than that, sit back and relax.Canopy Flyer - It gives you a bird’s eye view of The Lost World and can be a little scary especially if you’re afraid of heights and you sit in the seat that faces backwards . There are some dips and turns, but still smooth and enjoyable overall.6-Far Far AwayShrek 4-D Adventure – Must try. I noticed that you get sprayed a lot. And the seats jerk pretty roughly at some point of time. The intro-movie that they do is pretty long, so stay patient! But the ride itself is exciting.7-MadagascarMadagascar: A Crate Adventure – It’s a slow boat ride through well-made sets Monster Rock – Could not tryEnchanted Airways - Could not try==============================================================Here are some tips for making your visit more enjoyable to Universal Studios, Singapore.• Choose the weekdays without public holiday, if possible, as the weekend would be more crowded.• Wear comfortable attire i.e. shorts and t-shirt. Wear sandals or flip-flop. Avoid jeans, jacket, and shoes.• Reach there as early as possible. It opens at 10 am. Ask for free shuttle service from your hotel.• The first thing you should do is take the USS map and card with various entertainment timings with you.• You can always plan your day according to your preferences and queue timings. You should ask the queue time before entering to attraction, so you can utilize your time more efficiently.HOPE THIS INFO WILL HELP YOU TO PLAN YOUR NEXT VISIT.

review_413885618,“Great Park but long queues.”,"Universal Studios Sentosa was great fun. We had a good day out and there are quite a few rides for adults.We went with our 10 month old, although there's not much to do for little kids but you can still walk around and see the different sections of the park. Luckily we were 4 adults so we took turns to go on the rides.The park is divide into different areasStarting with Hollywood, then New York, then Scifi City, Ancient Egypt, Jurassic Park, Far Far Away and the last part was Madagascar. The park gets very busy so I would recommend a Universal express pass as its a lot quicker, we wouldn't have been able to go on all the rides if we went through the normal queues as they were more than 2 hours long. The park is great and characters have shows and meet ups at different times so it's best to check that from info centre near the entrance. The parade only happens on weekends so we could t see that but otherwise there were a lot of characters and photo opportunities. We had a great day out and our son really enjoyed the park too. The only downside is that the souvenir and Universal shop is quite expensive and also the food inside is not very cheap.

review_413875479,“Fun day!!”,"Travelled to Singapore with 7 family members aged 25-61. Only 3 of us fancied Universal so I went with my partner (we're both 25) and my brother (28). We all had such a fun day!I've been to Universal Orlando and Universal LA and yes this park is a lot smaller but actually I liked the fact it was compact. We arrived before the gates opened and therefore managed to get on 5 rides without queuing in the first hour. We did have to queue for about an hour for the rapids but it was a fun ride and we then went on again single rider. Be prepared to get very wet though! I chickened out of the Battlestar Galactica rollercoasters so wondered round on my own whilst the boys went on them, they spent just under 2 hours queuing and going on both which wasn't bad when just one of the rides was saying wait time 90 minutes. Some of the rides felt very short but they were still fun. There isn't loads to do compared to some theme parks but certainly enough to fill a day. We were there from before 10am to after closing at 6pm and we still hadn't done everything (although we gave some kiddy rides a miss on purpose and went on some rides multiple times).We contemplated getting fast passes but didn't. SO happy we decided against it as apart from the rides I mentioned we practically walked straight onto the others. We went midweek, Wednesday, so yes it might be worth it at the weekend. Overall we had a fantastic day and I would definitely visit again if I get the chance to return to Singapore!

Kids really go mad at various rides and attractions at the Universal. This time we tried the Mummy Ride, was really thrilling. The best fun is the transformer 3D ride, the ultimate and worth waiting in line for 1 hour.

review_413730549,“Fun day in sentosa”,"We got our tickets off KLOOK (they only deal with etickets) for S60 dollars. We took the boardwalk into sentosa - they had movators and it was covered. You are allowed to bring your own water in and our bags weren't searched upon entry. We got in early (10:30) and had got onto four rides by 12:00. We really enjoyed the transformer ride (amazing), and the Indoor mummy ride (except for the lady that screamed at everyone for queuing up - there were no signs around telling us what to do, nor was it busy (only around 10 people waiting in line) - some training needs to be done on customer service and clearer signs put on the ride. This is an amusement park and they should be selling joy/fun and negativity should not be part of the experience. Of course, this was an isolated incident and the rest of the ride was great! We also did Shrek 4D and the Puss in Boots journey (it was just okay). Getting here before 12:00 really helps! Found that as the day went, the wait times got longer. Mostly just 15-20 minutes. We had a great day here and enjoyed all the shows!

Great day out.No huge thrill rides but what they do, they do well.Negatives are the queue times (but that is in every theme park). Biggest gripe, having to pay for lockers after 45 mins. Compulsory as you can't leave bags at the rides but you get 45min free time then get charged for time after. Average queue time 60+ mins. The waterworld stunt show was amazing and worth a visit.Food is also great and not badly priced. Staff in the restaurant are grumpy and unfriendly though.Worth doing but be prepared to wait and pay extras.

review_413362496,“Needs some TLC”,"First of all - nothing about this is Singaporean.....but I digress - the park doesn't pretend to be. Moving on. I was surprised about the state of park and how unclean it was. Not untidy with garbage - just not clean. Everywhere I looked there was something that could use some attention. Steps coming off the Madagascar ride looked like they hadn't seen a wash in....ever? On the treasure hunters ride the fake hippos and crocs were covered in algae and moss. There's accent lights broken off their bases all over the place. Just not spending money on upkeep I guess. To boot, on the shrek 4D ride somebody went through a exit thinking it was a way out and it shut down the entire far far away land for over an hour.....I realize it's not universals fault but....there wasn't any signs on the doors except exit. Seems like a pretty important thing to have if it takes down a whole section of the park. We wandered over to the water ride in Jurassic park only to have it also not operational also. The best ride of the place was the mummy. However if you have anything that resembles a bag they make you put it in a locker - which is fine - and the locker is free for the first 45 minutes. The kicker is that for every 20 minutes over the first 45 you have to pay $4 to get it back. You're going to pay every time - and they know it. On a busy day that is likely over $30 for a locker just to go on one ride. With the ticket price over $70 that just feels like gouging. Wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend.

The 3D transformers was also very worthwhile. Unfortunately the queuse times were excessive. My advice is to use a toilet before joining the cue and take some water.

The rest of the place is quite a lot of fun as well. We were all adults, but I would imagine that kids will have a really good time here! 3. Do take a look at the stores in each section they have some pretty interesting things and apparels. NOTE: You cannot club it with other things in Sentosa. You have to give it an entire day.

And ideally wear light cotton shirt/blouse!! Also lockers are available for free for 45 mins at a time - which allows you to go on a few rides and then go pick them up. We bought the express pass and we're very pleased we did. It allows you one fast track ride per ride - unless you invest in the unlimited express pass. We went on a Saturday (and to be honest, I was dreading the potential volume of people)... But with rain forecast, I think many people stayed away.... And to our good fortune, the rain stayed away!!

We also compared its prices versus those of Skyline Travel. They’re similar. You can do either one, both substantially cheaper than the regular prices.• We went on a Friday in mid-summer. Queues are LONG~~~. Luckily, we had express passes, which you need to buy from Universal Studio’s official channels. We’re a pretty big group and not everyone is interested in taking all the rides. So, we bought several Express passes to share. There’re 2 types of Express pass – one allows one ride per game and an unlimited pass. With the “one-time” option, we only had to show our print-out at the queue. Could easily share among us. With the “unlimited”, we managed to do likewise for several rides until we did Transformer. There’s actually a station selling express pass there and the staff required us to change our paper pass to a wristband. Once we did, it’s locked up with one person and we could no longer share it. If you intend to share express pass like we did, do the Transformer ride last.

It's quite a small park but there is plenty to entertain for 6 hours or so. The transformers ride is totally amazing, we did it twice and you noticed more things second time around, it's worth going for this ride alone.

But I'm spoilt with the experience of the american park versions.”,"We arrived early, and joined the line to enter...we had already pre purchased our ticket in a Sentosa triple that included island entry, unlimited cable car, SEA Aquarium entry and universal studios entry. We have been to universal studios in LA as well as Florida so my review is governed by those standards. I have also been to the Gold Coast one(which by the way does not compare to the american versions).It is on a small scale perhaps 1/3 the size of the american theme parks. The park is divided into worlds for those that have never been and each world is built upon that theme with rides to match them and shops with the relevant souvenirs.The rides where few in each world, with only a couple in each and these where mostly roller coaster rides. My favourite ride would be the lost world wild river ride, only because it's one of the few that are different to a roller coaster, don't get me wrong, I love roller coasters but it becomes a little repetitive! If you are visiting and enjoy coaster rides I suggest you purchase a front of the line pass...it's well worth the money as otherwise you'll find yourself lining up for a 2 or 4minute ride for over well over 100 minutes in the heat, so you may only get a few rides in a day visit.If you cannot for some reason ride roller coaster rides, but want to experience the park, just buy your basic ticket for the cheapest price possible, go early and line up for the ones you can go on( the lost world wild raft ride is the most popular of these) so go there first before the lines become ridiculously long and enjoy the atmosphere, the lengths of the fabulous detailed structures, and the entertainment in feature films shown only here, street shows and other entertainment, and enlightening stunt shows. It is an experience that everyone should experience in their lifetime. Take plenty of money if you want to purchase souvenirs that you can only buy here in the park and food. As there are plenty of places to sit, eat and drink and get out of the heat. Or you can bring along your own but you will need to put it in a pay locker as many of the rides you cannot take even your camera!This park is larger and much better than the Gold Coast one if you are Australian and have been lucky enough to visit that park, so in my opinion you should make this park a must visit if you liked that one. But if you have been to the American versions you may like us e disappointed.

review_411484794,“Awesome ”,"I was not so sure or excited about this thing but then .... Woww!!! This place is amazing. Loads of rides and things to see. Loved the show about the visual effects and camera tricks. So real. Our favourite rides were the transporters, mommy and then the roller coasters. Absolutely amazing place. Get the express line if it's possible. Will cost u 50$ single entry each ride or 70 $ multiple. Which ever , express really saves you at least 30 minutes per ride waiting time. We have noticed it's even 115 minutes waiting time for roller coasters around 1 pm on weekends. But the crowd may be less during evening from 5 pm. But we had express unlimited entry and felt really worth it.

review_411439492,“Do not come on end of the year!”,"Try not to come during end of the year like december 24 onwards. The queue was veeerry long and the rides are starting to break down. When we first enter, the first ride that we wanted to try was the Transformers' ride, unfortunately, a technical problem occurred! Just when they open the theme park! I can't believe it! We wasted 2 hours in the line for nothing. So overall after staying there for 1 whole day, we just managed to ride the Galactica and Shrek 4D! It was too crowded!

review_411307669,“Something for everyone”,"There is something for everyone - young or old, adventurous or not. The two rollercoaster rides based on the Battlestar Galactica theme are awesome and should not be missed (if you like rollercoasters, that is!) Just be prepared for very long queues - about one hour. If you can afford it, buy the express tickets as that slashes the waiting time considerably. The shows which take place during the day are also entertaining. My advice for the water ride - don't waste your money by putting your stuff in the locker (this one is not free like the others). Rather buy a raincoat for $4 to keep your phones and cameras dry.

review_411076249,“Definitely Buy The Express Pass”,"On our recent trip to Singapore, my family and I went to Universal Studios on Sentosa Island and it was a brilliant day indeed. Getting to Sentosa is very easy and there are several modes of transport to get there i.e. the monorail, cable car or just a taxi. We decided on getting there using an Uber cab which I recommend to those who are in large families! It's just a lot easier and more cost effective.We also bought our tickets for SGD$60 on klook.com which I highly recommend. We looked at offers on several websites and Klook offered the best rate so definitely have this app ready for your trip to Singapore! Upon arrival at the park, we noticed how crowded it was and decided to buy the express pass. At an additional SGD$60 per person, the price is steep but I highly recommend buying one especially if you only have a day to spend at the park. Lines are generally very long but because of the fast pass, we managed to finish all the rides at the park by 3pm and just spent the rest of time going on our favourite rides again. The longest we had to wait was 30 minutes for the Jurassic Park river ride which seems long but the normal line was 1.5 hours. The shortest we had to wait was just 1-2 minutes. The rides at the park were brilliant! Our family loved Revenge of the Mummy, the Galactica Rollercoasters and the Jurassic Park Lost Worlds Ride.We had a great day and highly recommend springing up for the Express Passes!

We purchased our tickets online and we were whisked through into the park, once we found our bearings we targeted the thrill seeker rides. My highlight was the Transformer ride and my son's was the coasters, simply amazing and I liked the fact you could leave to eat outside the park and re enter so you were not a captive audience. Young or not so young it is worth a visit but plan ahead, look for deals online or locally.

This is nothing like the USA Universal studios, but it has some fun attractions. Waterworld was by far the best fun. Lots of roller coasters that cater to all types. I'd hate to be there on a hot day as its concrete, concrete, concrete. Just a good way to spend a cloudy day. Negatives are that not all rides had the priority pass lanes, which is weird considering the price is more than the entry price. Fun day, be prepared to sleep well that night, we were all pooped.

Two are water ride based.buying a fast track pass is advisable on busy days, specially on School holidays in Singapore. It saves lot of waiting time. Fast track tickets are available in side the park as well and no ques. In water based rides you are warned saying you are going to get really wet and they suggest you to buy polythene covers. do not worry it ll be only few drops of water if at all. some times they say waiting time is more than 50 mins for fast track entry specially at the Lost World entrance. but this is a lie.Transformers, Egypt and Lost world are the best rides. 4D movies are really nice. so enjoy.

Okay, these characters are comparatively new, but still you try to fantasise..The rides are fantastic, specially ""The revenge of the Mummy"" (Ancient Egypt) & Battlestar Galactica ""Cylon"" rides. A must visit section - ""Lights! Camera! Action"" by Steven Spielberg, really awesome & thrilling and an experience.Various stores selling themed merchandise- Minions, Madagascar, Transformers, Shrek, etc. and live performances by look-alike of Marilyn Monroe & Cleopatra, just too good. Last but not the least 'The Lost World' & 'Waterworld' deserve a special mention.One should buy Express ticket to enjoy all the rides and avoid long- long queues which drain you of energy & precious time. As such it would take atleast 4 to 5 hours to complete the full circuit (with selective rides only). And as the Sun sets and lights are on .. - a different place all together.

The entrance price, like most things in Singapore was not cheap (around 90 dollars each??). The Transformers ride is what you should run for as soon as you arrive, the airing time grows quickly. None of the rides are as fast and furious as you would find elsewhere, Universal Studios have really played to their strengths and focused on their digital abilities to create innovative augmented and virtual reality rides. Expect to queue and don't get too excited about the food, but a great experience and I was very happy to have been!

Limited under cover areas and a lot of rides shut down if there is lightening. If you have flexibility on when you go I would be checking the weather and trying to pick a low chance of lightning / rain day.

review_410348153,“Ruined by economic rationalism”,"Being a fan of theme parks and having visited many across the world, this was going to be a special treat. Sadly, it wasn't up to Singapore's high standards.It becomes clear fairly quickly that if you only pay for a normal ticket, you have to be prepared to wait in queues for a long time and make up for the cheaper ticket by paying for extras.The irony is that the more time a customer spends waiting in long queues, they are not buying anything. They are not in the shops, they are not buying food or drinks. We spent about five hours in queues which were mostly boring and hot. Thankfully there are water fountains positioned in most queues.The better, more exciting rides, don't allow you to take anything in the queue. So, if you are in the queue for the Cylon ride (best in the park) you can't use your mobile device to while away the 100 plus minutes (on a normal weekday). Other parks have a spot to leave last minute items as you board the ride. Good move. Spectacles are the only items allowed in the queue.Instead, Universal provide free lockers. Sounds good until you see the time limit: 45 minutes! When you return to your locker, you have to pay to retrieve your belongings. We had everything taken off us, including wallets. If you don't have money and the time limit has expired you can't retrieve your things easily. Another time waster. Keep some cash on you but the machine doesn't give change! Credit cards are accepted but Singapore uses six-digit PINs so if you have a four digit number, it may not work.So, a ride costs you an hour or two plus an additional $4 for the locker!If you have the money a Universal Express ticket will save time and you shouldn't have to pay the locker fee.Compare with Disneyland which has a system where you can get a ride ticket for a particular time, go away and do something useful and come back in time for your ride. It's like reserving a place in the queue. Good system and no extra cost.If Disneyland markets itself as the happiest place on earth, Universal Studios Singapore (not Hollywood) is a utilitarian place that processes customers as 'bums on seats' rather than guests. The staff were efficient but mostly dour and disengaged.The grounds and general condition of Universal Studios are showing wear and tear which is not up to Sentosa's standards.Food is barely acceptably at the cheap end ie Mel's Diner. This should have been a good novelty destination but a McDonalds would have been better. There are more expensive options if you have loads of cash. Hopefully they serve better quality food.On the plus side, the 'Waterworld' is a very good live production. A bit cheesy but well choreographed and quite spectacular if you want some exciting pictures to take home.The Cylon ride is hard to beat. One of the best on the planet IMHO.Free wifi across Sentosa is brilliant. Transport is easy and cheap.By all means go to Universal Studios but if you have children with you you may have difficulty keeping them amused in queues. You will spend a lot more money than you expected just to do normal things like getting on a ride and buying food and drinks.

review_410328244,“Universal pricey but delivers.....”,"We stopped in Singers for nearly a week after an Australia - Singapore cruise. Traveled with 3 teenage sons - family of five. Whether your kids are little, teenagers or you are just a kid at heart Universal is well worth a visit. We opted for the 2 day pass for Sentosa that covered 1 day at Universal and 1 day doing the other attractions at Sentosa - best value for money and could easily have spent another day there. We have spent a lot of time over the years at the Gold Coast theme parks and Universal Singapore certainly blows them away! One huge tip - pay extra for the express ride pass if you intend doing them a lot - well worth the extra A$50/day when you don't have to stand on a huge line for an hour or more in Singapore's heat and humidity. Majority of cafes and eating areas are air conditioned and provided welcome respite, they are expensive, but what theme park food and drink isn't - take plenty of your own bottled water with you! My teenage sons loved Universal as well as Sentosa in general - well worth the money and just a short taxi drive from CDB about S$10 - S$15 - beware however if you return after 5pm the rates go up.

review_409909477,“A must-see attraction of Singapore”,"You can't go to Singapore and not visit Universal Studios Singapore (USS).Tickets tend to be pricey. The popular ticket tends to be a day-use ticket (or other ticket options available on the USS website - ticketing booths are also there if you wish to physically buy tickets)The express pass gives you the chance to access the best rides in USS through a much much shorter queue.The express pass needs to be bought separately from the entrance ticket. In my opinion, you cannot visit USS in a day unless you have purchased the express pass.Watch out for the chance to grab photos with masked and dressed up superheroes (e.g. from Transformers, Sesame Street, Madagascar, etc)My personal favourite was the Transformers 4D ride.Waiting for the monorail back and forth from Sentosa station can really drain you and may be a big issue. At peak times, the monorail is absolutely packed and the queues to hop onto the monorail can be unbelievable. I do not have a solution to that in mind since pretty much everyone depends on the monorail.Tips:Carry an empty bottle of water into USS so as to replenish from the free water filters. You will have to rehydrate because of the warmth and humidity.Buy tickets beforehand online because of the discounts or promotional campaigns that may be on offer.Food is extremely expensive. Snack bars or anything like that can be really handy and a life saver.There is a 7-11 near the monorail stop leading to USS. McD etc are available in a neighbouring building (outside of USS) (Keep in mind you may re-enter USS with a day pass)

We brought a lot of the ride photos as I enjoy looking at our scared faces but they are expensive and add up by the end of the day. Plenty of options for meals, we shared a enormous pizza and lots of merchandise to buy. Recommend for a fun family day out.

review_409697358,“too much queues but great fun after all”,"Treated my 13 year old son and 76 yrs old father for great fun in this amazing place! Unfortunately, if you don't have any VIP pass, you'll end up queuing too long to famous attractions for a quick thrill but it was still worth it though... music entertainment outside the park was also fun which my father enjoyed when he got tired walking around... we got loads of photos taken in every corner of the place!!! Though they should have made the lockers for free in attractions where you could get drenched instead of paying them which I thought was already like too much after paying hefty amount for the entrance fee especially after queuing too long!!! the management should think about that... also add more restaurants inside as they are very limited too!!!

This way we were not troubled by the entrance queue or queue for any rides.The Mummy ride and the Battlestar Galactica were excellent thrill rides but the Jurassic Park Rapids and Madagascar rides were also good fun.The free locker system is a great idea as you can store your belongings for a short period of time whilst you go on certain rides.The shows were good and the food was surprisingly good.

review_408702971,“The Universal experience/ too hot / long waiting times.”,"We arrive at Universal after spending a quiet morning at Madame Tussaud's and it was busy from the word go. The park then just go worse and so did the heat. The staff at Singapore need to go to Florida to see how it should be done.There was no slick movement of crowds and it just left you feeling that they had taken your money and did not give a stuff what the experience was like or how long the wait times were.We waited 50 mins for the mummy going as single riders, which should be quick only to find one coaster being used, what did they need a written invite to get out the other one and half the times. Transformers was an hour, Jurassic park water ride an hour while the Battlestar rides were120mins each.We went on Monday, God only knows what the weekend would be like, I asked a member of staff why it was so busy and she said this was a normal day.I would say go early opens at 10am , plan the big ones and get them done then fill in with shows and achievable rides for the afternoon.Good luck and remember to drink lots and think cool thoughts while in those long wait lines.

Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure spend most of my time (2 hours), but if you a single rider, you can queue in the single ride lines, it just take maybe 15-30 minutes wait. In the afternoon 5-8, most of rides are empty, so don't need queuing. Actually, its not a big theme park, just because the queuing time, it takes long time.

Sure - all the rides are still entertaining, albeit the queue to get in was astronomical ........... When you get in - queue again.I bought the annual fast pass supplement , which gave faster access to several of the attractions. Extremely disappointed to note they are still selling the fast pass supplements, but have withdrawn fast pass access on two of the attractions ( Ancient Egypt car ride and Enchanted Airways) staff at Ancient Egypt were just off hand and said it had been discontinued. Staff on this ride seem to have some adjustment disorder and are not very friendly at all - daylight robbery!!! Just another way of conning you!!! Mentioned this to the staff who are just not interested.Keen to take your money - reluctant to deliver. Certainly not as good value as it was.

review_407756452,“Another visit”,"This is my second visit to USS. This is not as massive as most of US in the world but it is compact and comparable with the rest US. I have tried most of the ride except the roller coaster which look to scary for an acrophobia like me. I like the Transformer ride so much that I ride it twice. Then the Mummy ride is also great. The water world show is so real that we enjoy it so much and this is a never missed show when you are in USS. The best thing the smaller scale of the USS is we can run in a short time to catch up with the show in the different attraction. Another one is that we can almost cover up the place in only one day if it is not over crowded. The parade is one of the waited show and it is a perfect ending for the visit. Catch up with the Madagascar in land of far-far away and enter the castle. Souvenir..I love how various type of souvenir they have. I buy the tall bottle with a grip which now I use to hang my cardholders. The USS is a real example of limitless joy in a limited space.

review_407743389,“Amazing but average”,"This is a must see experience. The atmosphere is great and there is all round entertainment going on. But that is where the wonder of the park ends. If you are just content to wonder around and take in the atmosphere, it is a great place to see.But if you want to get on the rides, be prepared to wait.You will need to get another day pass to experience everything at the theme park.Waiting times for rides such as the Transformers can be 3 hours (standing). Battlestart Galactica was 2 hours, and if you had put your stuff in a locker as required and exceed the time alloted for the ride, you will be required to pay for the locker. The wait for the Jurrasic Park ride was 2 hours.We only managed the above 3 rides before it was time to leave the park. Although the rides were great, when you work it out, it was not really not value for your money.If you had purchased an ""express ticket"", your wait would have been about half of that time. Perhaps, a roaming team member offering complimentary water may have made the wait a bit more bearable, especially in the heat.A minor let down was some of the visitors to the park seemed to queue jump. I witnessed this on every ride that I queued up for. It would seem the time honoured discipline of queing in Singapore did not apply in the theme park. To be fair to Singaporeans, the queue jumpers appeared to be tourists rather than your average Singaporean. No one seemed to be supervising the queues.Finally, for a place renowned for it's food, the food at the park was overpriced and disappointing.All in, would I go there again? NoWould I recommend it to another, Yes, but be prepared for the wait, if you are going on the rides .... and the queue jumpers.

You can buy your Universal Studios Singapore (USS) tickets there and a ticket to the the first station (around $4) or you can use your MRT card, When you get to the station, USS is a short walk to the left, well sign posted. You can exit USS with a stamp (you cant at other US like Osaka). USS has Transformers, The Revenge of the Mummy, Lost World, Shrek Castle and Madagascar to name a few. Our favorite is the The Mummy, which is air conditioned for most of the entry, although you need to place bags, etc into a locker that works by finger scan, it is very hot and humid in the locker area and if you have problems with your locker, it can get very frustrating while waiting for assistance.

We came from the city so we rode the MRT to Vivo City and took the train to Sentosa which brought us directly to Universal Studios. At 10:30am, the place was packed with queues stretching almost to the Hershey's outlet. There are more attractions than rides all geared towards the magic of movie making. What I really enjoyed was the Terminator ride which saw us being in the middle of the fight between the giant robots. It was such a thrill. Food options are plentiful although you have to (carefully) pick and choose where to have your meals.We stayed long enough to watch the afternoon parade filled with Universal Studios starts and characters.

review_407395513,“Nowhere near as good as Universal Studios Orlando”,"After prebooking tickets on their web site (including Express passes) i started having second thoughts after reading some of the reviews (should have done that beforehand!).There's quite a limited number of rides here and, needless to say, the good rides have long lines! Food concessions are, like all theme parks, expensive.I was, to be frank, disappointed.Unless you want to experience a monorail or cable car (and pay for the privilege) it's only a short walk over the boardwalk to get from the metro station (through the shopping mall!) onto Sentosa Island. There are travelators over some of the boardwalk and it's a pleasant walk on a sunny day!

This is our 4th time to visit Universal Studios and every time we go there we always make sure that all of us are well hydrated as it is hot and you need to do a lot of walking. Best to have a cap/hat and an extra shirt especially for kids. A lot of things to see and do. Best to have an express pass for the attractions if you have limited time to see this place.

review_407011173,“Fantastic sets and atmosphere but definitely express yourself!”,"As you'd expect, Universal Studios is pretty impressive but as you'd also expect, it's very popular and therefore be prepared to wait...a lot! If you wanted to make the most of your day here, do yourself a favour and get an Express pass.We were with a 2yo who could only go on a handful of rides so we didn't see the value in buying the Express pass but if he was 122cm plus in height (the key height to accessing most rides) I wouldn't hesitate to pay the $70 per person.We arrived at opening time of 10am and it took half an hour to get through the gates (with already purchased tickets), and from there, the rides were a minimum 30 minute wait and most around a 60 minute wait. Without an express pass, you'd probably get to do 5-6 rides. This was on a Thursday-imagine a weekend or school holidays!On the positive, the themed areas were spectacular and really took you to the scene of each movie. The music playing in each zone adds to the excitement and the detail of each building, shop, restaurant and ride is definitely pretty amazing. The roller coasters and thrill rides all looked pretty spectacular and there was a nice range of rides for little kids too-from the Madagascar crate ride to the Dino Soaring. One of the highlights was the Sesame Street show-the shows are definitely a great break from the heat and very entertaining.Universal Studios is definitely worth a visit but get yourself an express pass, break up the heat with some shows and time in the themed restaurants/eateries, and be prepared to spend some money-you can't bring food into the park and to eat and drink is pretty expensive!A little hint: getting to Sentosa from downtown Singapore is a bit of a mission with swapping MRTs and then getting through Harbourside/Vivocity to the packed Sentosa Express. For around $15, a taxi will drop you to the Sentosa Island hub (including S.E.A Aquarium, Universal Studios) in about a quarter of the time it took us to get there from Bugis Junction !

review_406839569,“Express pass is the way to go”,"Long queues everywhere. great attractions such as the Mummy and transformers is a must but you will have to wait a long time to get on it. you will need an express pass if you dont want to wait a long time. average waiting time on these rides is about 45 - 90 minutes. The elmo ride was the longest. the line was deceiving as at first I thought there was no queue then you turn outside and boom there it is. definitely wont be doing that again. if you are here from the morning make sure to wear a hat bring a water parka. some rides will get you wet. Buy your ticket at the airport as they will give you discount and also meal voucher to be used in the Malaysia street food court. and yes eat here not at the places inside universal studio.

review_406818185,“Impressed”,"Loved this place, a little different to Universal Studios in LA insofar they don't have the tram ride through the studio lot showing stage sets, etc., very much runs along the lines of a Disneyland. Some great rides which can attract huge queues so my biggest tip to visitors is buy the one per ride queue jumper. They have 3 types of tickets; general admission, queue jumper where you can do this once on each ride and a queue jumper where it is unlimited. We went for the unlimited which cost quite a bit more but we found out we ended up only going on each ride once as the park gets very crowded and we were moving from one ride to the other. There are a few attractions where you saw how movies are made and all in all we had a great day. Frozen mango drink worth every cent :-)

review_406634454,“Fun”,"Have visited Los Angeles and Orlando parks, which are truthfully way better and bigger. But we still had a great day here.Visited on a Wednesday and we got in just before 11am and many of the big rides had 60 minutes wait already. We decided to buy the express pass at $60 which we hoped to reduce times. But not really. We ended up just doing a bunch of kids stuff had some lunch and then after about 2pm noticed a lot of ride wait times coming down. With the express pass we used on the big roller coasters, Jurassic park and transformers. We didn't wait any longer than 5 min on any, and this was with the wait times still between 60-90 minutes.So my tip would be if hating to wait in lines. Spend the extra money on the express pass, but wait till later in the afternoon and use it then when most others have already used their express pass up.Even though the park is smaller this other universals it's still great for anyone of all ages.

We didn't wait longer than 20min. Transformers is absolutely amazing, The Mummy in close 2nd. Roller coasters are great too.

So u will need to prepare the hat , umbrella, wear as light as possible, prepare the water bottle, tower or tissue maybe if u easy get sweating.dont bring too much things, just bring a small bag so u can placed ur small bag in the locker in some attraction that not allow u bring anything while play the ride. There are few locker near the attraction, the locker is free according to the waiting time, u will be fined if exceed the time.Overall the attraction is fun with super exciting ride like mummy,transformer and many other, I was only able to play few before the closed of park due to waiting time is too long. The food here is good and tasty Tips: after enter the park, just rush to transformer ride because this attraction will always having the super long queue, u can take picture after then

review_406375111,"“TRANSFORMERS & Waterworld, DO NOT MISS THOSE!”","A small Universal Studios park which we still couldn't complete touring in one whole day, this movie magic paradise features entertainment for all ages in #epic proportions. A must-visit when in Singapore. Do check out the showtimes for specific performances so as not to miss great shows like the Sesame Street performance, Meet the Minions, Hollywood Dreams Parade & Lakeside Show (specific dates only), and the ever so EPIC Waterworld show, with its awesome stunts, pyrotechnics and big splashes. Also recommended is the Lights, Camera, Action by Steven Spielberg which features a Category 5 hurricane simulation (also be ready to get wet here if you're in the front row).The winner hands down is, as always, Transformers: The Ride. 90 minutes wait in line (buying the Express ticket doesn't really help much either thanks to the high volume of visitors)... but well worth it! And definitely more entertaining than any of the Michael Bay movies. In fact, this is how (I expected) a Transformers movie SHOULD BE. But Michael Bay wasted too much time on ""developing"" annoying characters, highschool romance/college humour nonsense, ""the chicks"", the US military gunghoness etc than the actual robots, their home Cybertron, *their* story, which is what TRANSFORMERS was always about. Few minutes of The Ride made you feel like you were part of the Transformers universe, and a REAL Transformers movie! Epic!

review_405961280,"“Buy the express card, its a must.”","Went here on a Monday and was surprised by the large volume of people. Was torn on buying express passes for my wife and 3 year old boy but was glad to have done so. They cost $120 Singapore dollars in addition to the entrance fee so this is a very expensive price. However, the lines inside were very long and the weather very hot with only some ceiling fans offering minimal cooling, so if you go on a busy day or have a young child, I recommend paying the price. There are only a few attraction per theme and a height limit for some so those with young children should take this in mind.

review_405897172,"“Worthwhile, but should be bigger and less money-hungry”","Introduction:I went to USS during a Singapore short trip with my fiancé in summer 2016. We entered the park with the unlimited express pass, after a bad experience in the Universal Studios in Osaka.Attractions:Good variety, fun rides, but way too small in number. If you own the Express Pass, you will be done with everything in less than half a day. We definitely enjoyed the Transformers 4D Ride the most.Prices: While the day ticket price is acceptable, it gets blown out of proportion with the Express Pass that cost the same as the actual ticket. Prices for food and drinks are hardly acceptable, and photographers waiting for extra cash (around 25 Singapore Dollar) for a photo with the characters of the park make it just too expensive. The least they could do is include the photos in the Express Pass fee.Staff:Rarely have I met a less motivated bunch of people. I understand that it is not fun selling Elmo Ventilators 8 hours a day, but watching these sad faces it either incredibly funny or incredibly sad, your pick.Recommended?During a stay in Singapore, sure. But if you are looking for a serious Theme Park-a-olic, better search elsewhere.

It was well worth the hour or so queueing. ""DO NOT MISS THE TRANSFORMERS RIDE"" I enjoyed a few breaks during my visit, Starbucks for coffee...KT's Grill for lunch and Mel's DriveIn for a cool drink before I left at 5pm.The Minions were popular...for young and old - great photo opportunities there.I will definitely be back to see the remainder of the park...I only saw 20% today.

We visited the Aquarium first and then made it into Universal Studios at around 1.30pm. We purchased our express pass straight away and while the longest wait time was at 75 minutes, we only had to wait 15 mins and that was only for one of the more popular roller coasters. As it got later in the day the wait times were much less and with the express pass, we hardly had to wait at all. Fave rides were the Mummy and Transformers. Catching the MRT and then the monorail (Sentosa Express) was easy. We left at around 6.30pm and while there was a long line for the monorail, it moved very quickly with only a 15-20 min wait time. Plenty of places to eat inside, whether for a sit down meal or snacks. We ate at KTs Grill in the New York section which had fairly decent food (salads, burgers, sandwiches etc.) Not a cheap day out (especially with the express pass costing $70) but definitely worth it.

review_404925932,“A fun day to remember”,"This is a must if in Singapore and especially wiht kids. few important tips, please please purchase the unlimited express pass as this made the biggest diffeence. You pay much more than the normal pass of course but worth every penny. Make sure you also get there before 10 am to benefit from the money you are spending. because of the express pass you get to enter from a seperate gate where there is no queue. Our bags were not checked for food so could be just a one of case but I would certainly recommend carrying a water bottle. This can be fllled at several water coolers all around the place. wear and carry adequate sunscreen and yes please do carry caps and I would recommend parasols too...the heat can really get to you so am so glad we too umberellas and used them. In terms of rides we were two adults and 2 kids. and I had done a lot of reading bout what I should definitely try. There are some amazing rides and as someone mentioned if you want to the adult rides as soon as you enter universal take the right. if you have kids and want to focus on their rides take the immediate left which will bring you to the Madagascar area. Ensure you do pick up a map at the entrance as this is certainly needed. we carrie a stroller and honest did not have any problems taking one along. In each area there a place where you can keep the strollers and trust me this is not veyr far from the rides itself. Also please ensure you wear comfy clothing. shorts and tshirts or sleeveless tops are highly recommended. Also carry sanitiser and lots of wet wipes if travelling with kids.

Sad thing was that the express pass at some attractions were only marginally better than the normal que. Not sure whether it's worth the premium.I suggest heading there about 30mins before the park opens and be the first into the park. Go for the Battlestar ride first followed by the Transformers. Then head over the Jurassic park rapids ride coz this opens about an hour later. Getting there early will save you hours in the ques.Great experience if not for wasting money on express passes.

review_404698213,“Exciting experience”,"USS is nearest Universal Studio to Malaysia. The entrance fee is very affordable. The landscape of USS is very unique. They divide the section according to theme such as futuristic, hollywood, Madagascar, Jurassic Park. It is advisable to visit the USS during the weekdays and non public holiday as you don't have to queue for the rides. Overall, it was an exciting and great experience and will definitely come here again.

review_404526367,“Good for family vacation activity ”,"It is a large luna park for families.One of the main attractions of Singapore so it is a must to visit it.The rides are mainly for kids apart from the roller coaster. The lines are HUGE. Even people who bought a fast track were simply cutting the queue by half. The waiting time is minimum 30 mins for most rides. My advice is to either ride as a single rider since they simply fill the gaps with single riders so the line goes faster. One other advice is to remove all your belongings and put them in the locker or get a rain coat since you will get soaking wet at the JURASSIC PARK.

review_404519832,“Fantastic day with the kids.”,"We visited the park on August with three kids below 8 years. The weather was hot and humid; however, the fans on the queues made big difference. It was a week day, and luckily the park wasn't crowded in the morning. I suggest you download the park's app to help you plan your shows and activities in the park as some queues reach 60+ minutes of waiting at noon. The park is huge so bringing or renting a stroller from the park is a good idea for the little ones. So many things to do and see for adults and kids too.

review_404446107,“Thank you tripadvisor”,"I have just finished a day at USS with my 5 and 6 year old. I had studied all of the feedback on tripadvisor and so glad I did. Hot tips I would share are : -Don't buy tickets until you arrive at airport as much cheaper and you can go any day as online you must go on date you book which is good with kids if plan goes pear shaped - I didn't buy fast pass and glad I didn't as you can buy them all throughout the park if you need to-go at 9am and have pancakes in a fab place just before the USS gates then get to gates for 9.30 no later - I went left after Hollywood and started the Madagascar way then forever ever land then Jurassic world just in time for it opening at 11am. This route works perfectly and didn't wait anymore than 15 mins and most times first in the que- we had lunch at 11.30 before the crowds and then headed out when everyone started to come in for lunch so again missed the ques- the only one we missed was transformers with a 2 hour wait. So if this is a favorite I would recommend going there first and then headed back in the same route - take lots of plastic ziplock bags for wet clothes and to protect dry ones - don't leave for taxi after 4pm as it goes manic. We got there for 3.45 and it was perfect but wow in 15 mins massive long que. the taxi man said this when he dropped us off and really saved us. He said 5.30-6pm also quieter. - read up on tripadvisor as it really saved me on several factors Enjoy overall a fun day out for the little ones.

No adequate staff to manage the day when large crowd visit the place(Eg:- 9 Aug 2016). Recommend tourists to check and purchase the Universal Express Tickets which is about S$60 per head but that pass was also not valid for some rides. The thrill and enjoyment was lost because of these waiting times. No adequate cooling fans for the people waiting in the line.

Though it was super hot during our trip last summer, March 2016 we nevertheless, chose to enjoy it up to the last bit. The Transformer Ride was gruesome, but nothing can beat the Ancient Egypt Ride, I thought I was going to die because of the stomach and head banging ride! It was good while it lasted and I kept screaming at the top of my lungs to release stress! All other rides and sights were a welcome experience after that.Vin Diesel was cool while Frankenstein was super cute...The afternoon live show was nostalgic with great and known Americal songs sang splendidly by the performers. The old cars on exhibit was super cool, too. Shrek and Fiona were roaming around much to the delight of the kids and the oldies alike. Hollywood Street was full of great stores for photo opportunities. At the Marina//Bay Area where we sat for awhile, we had a great time resting while listening to the overhead songs being played. It was a great way to spend our 2016 summer.

review_403247062,"“A good park, but with some problems”","Universal Studios Singapore is an excellent experience, both for tourists and residents, and is definately worth visiting during a trip to Singapore. The park itself is large, very well built and visuall pleasing, as well as well situated, taking only a fifteen minute Taxi ride from the centre of Singapore and has good value for money. Of particular note are the attractions; unlike other theme parks that contain mostly rollercoasters, this park has a wide variety of rides to suit all ages, with the different lands of the park catering to all demographics. Personal highlights include:* The Transformers Ride, which is great fun for most ages and honestly the best ride in the park. Give it a try, it's awesome! * The Battlestar Gallactaca Coasters, the world's tallest duelling coasters, of which the blue one is especially fun for thrill-seekers.* The Waterworld Show, which is on three times a day and is very entertaining to watch with great action. * The Daily Parade, which features characters and entertainers based on all five lands of the park, and is visually stunning.* The Jurassic Park Rapids, a fun family water ride that, while not as good as its counterparts in America, is still very well designed.* The Revenge of the Mummy Rollercoaster, a brilliantly themed ride that feels like a cinematic experience, but may be too scary for young children. As you can see by my list (which barely covers even a third of the total attractions in the park) the park offers a lot with good value for money, although drinks and food (despite being relatively high quality) can get expensive for large groups as you are not permitted to bring food/beverages into the park. I only have two small complaints:* The park, as it isn't essentially your standard ""tourist"" attraction, but popular with everyone, can get very, very crowded, especially on public holidays like when we visited. As a result, ride wait times can skyrocket, like it did with us, resulting in most rides having a 45 minute plus wait time at minimum, although the rides are worth it for the most part. You may want to skip the lines... Which brings me on to my next complaint...* The ""fast pass"" situation is tricky. On one hand, on a day as busy as mine, fast pass is practically required to get on everything in one day, but on the other hand, fast pass isn't that fast. Even with the pass, due to the way they load/unload rides, you will be waiting a solid ten minutes minimum before getting to ride. Perhaps that was only due to how busy the park was, but even though it lets you skip 90% of the queue, it isn't a pass straight onto them, which is dissapointing. Still though, take this with a grain of salt, as the park was VERY busy when we visisted, and may work very differently when you visit.Despite these complaints, the park still contains all the rides you would expect from a Universal Studios, and is a great experience overall, so I definately recommend visiting, especially if you have young children or teenagers. A very good theme park, even if it can't stand up to bigger, better, similar parks in America and elsewhere.

But it seems that they still have not done much in terms of improving their Wait Time at each ride. So be prepared to queue in line for very long at each ride, even the kiddy ones.

The only short wait time was at the kiddy Carousel Merry Go Round- 5mins (but we didn't bother).Nonetheless we enjoyed the rides we got on and the shows we watched. And there were many many photo opps. (Esp. in Hollywood)Please make it a point to catch Waterworld at 12pm or 5pm. That show alone can make your day at USS worth it!

review_403025163,“Great Fun with young kids”,"Hi. We visited on August 8, 2016 with 2 kids. One on the autism spectrum. For special need, can obtain Express Pass (comes with unlimited rides - ie, can go to the same rides again and again with this pass) for 1 special need child and 1 accompanying adult. We bought the express pass for the rest of the family so that we can all go to the Express Q. Although it was expensive, it was really worth it. Most q were less than 10-15 min wait. Unfortunately, I can't seem to see special diet meal. Mayb there is somewhere . I didn't research well on this part as I had home packed lunch for my child who has food intolerance. We didn't go to all the rides as some rides are just too adventurous for my kids. Eg, roller coaster, transformer rides, etc. Take note that for Treasure Hunters in Ancient Egypt, there isn't a q separately for Express Pass. However upon explaining my child is Autistic, the cast member kindly let us into another lane with no q. Thank you for all the cast members for being so understanding! My boy absolutely had a ball! This is a slow, short ride no minimum sound effect. Madagascar boat ride - slow moving, contain darkness, loud sound effect. I personally enjoyed it very much. We had lunch around 12 noon. Still pretty quiet and less crowd. By 2pm when we had snack and drinks, it was super crowded in 2 eateries we walked in. So I guess most restaurant are generally pretty full then.

I really wished I hadn't bothered. Queuing times was 180 minutes at one point and there are only 3 big roller coasters, managed to get on two of them. After queueing for 90 minutes, the ride breaks down- really had enough by that point and that was only our second choice of ride! Feels like everyone has express pass so makes the queuing even more longer as obviously they get priority and sometimes that queue is just as long! Stupid locker system which is rammed with everyone else trying to do the same thing. You get charged for the locker if you go over the free allocated time and have to pay to unlock it but how when your bag is inside the locker with your money??? Ended up paying $63 for 4 rides what a disappointment. Too small for the amount of people that visits. However went on the Sentosa luge and sky ride afterwards and had more fun in an hour then we had had all day!!Visit but get express pass for sure!!!!!

review_402715452,“Too crowded and expensive ”,"Went on a Monday and it was packed. Almost every ride was 60-130 minutes queue time from 10.30 onwards.So as we wanted to experience the rides we decided to buy a express pass for 70 bucks extra each! We've done this at theme parks in the UK and it had been worth it. At these parks they only sell a certain amount of fast passes and they are time specific. This means you get onto the ride very quickly - it's actually a fast pass - and it doesn't effect the normal queue time too much. After buying the pass we went to queue up and found the express queue to be pretty much as long as the normal queue. I'm talking about 15-30 mins less and still over 30 mins for most rides. To ride the Battlestar Galactic coaster the express pass queue was 90 mins long!!! We felt pretty ripped off. It's clear Universal just want to sell as many of these as possible. But they have not made the experience customer friendly. This actually extends to the whole park where it seems like some better planning could have reduced the queue time on nearly all the rides, however, this would have made people less likely to buy express passes so I don't think they really even considered it. Apart from this the rides are pretty good. The park is pretty small. The prices are pretty high.

However, what it lacked in size, it more than made up for in cleanliness. Singapore is perhaps the cleanest city that I’ve ever been to. It was so refreshing to walk around in such pristine conditions all day long. Grant it, the temps were unrelenting but there are plenty of indoor rides and attractions that wallow you some respite from the weather conditions. We wavered on getting the fast pass but it was much more expensive and so we just took a chance and remarkably we were able to get on every action that we wanted to and still were finished with the park by 4:30!

The day i visited, most of the lines for the rides were long but it was worth the wait.Make sure to bring water and umbrella as it's very hot (around 30 C), Don't forget to wear sunblock. The staff too was friendly..especially during the water show. Before it started, they strike up a conversation with the audience.

review_402601848,“A hell of a lot better than Disneyland.”,"It seems all universal studios Parks are better than Disney. I had an annual pass, with the express passes. This meant that I only took 5 minutes to queue up. That deal was $365, and you can come here every single day. The attraction I least recommend is the Sesame Street show, it's plain dull and I had to sit next to a local girl who was screaming like hell. But at least most of the staff are very polite. There are some rude staff the slip in here and there, but not as rude as disney's rude staff. They also even let the ratio of normal people:express pass be 1:1, instead of Disneyland's 1:1trillion. The rides are ""sort"" of thrilling, with the exception of the battle star Galactica ride. Also, queuing times to take photos with stars? 3 minutes. That's 72 less than Disneyland, or shall I say the idiot's amusement park. In the end, thank you very much to one of the staff at the mummy ride for knowing me and taking me to the front of the line. I will most definitely visit again.

review_402598843,“Not the best Universal Studio we have been to.”,"Don't forget to buy the express pass! Doesn't matter if you are visiting during peak of off peak, express pass is the way to go. Universal Studio has poor signages and confusing. Granted it's not as big as others, we managed to visit all of its parks.On the day we visited, it rained. This was the first we visited a theme park in the rain and we have to pay SGD4.00 for literally a plastic bag to shield from the ran.Honestly, on some rides, we were concerned about safety as the some part of the waiting line leading to the ride was poorly lite, narrow and some ,on the stairs. We thought of in case of any emergency, no one will be able to find the exits.

Despite with the crowd and long queue, the waiting time for each ride is short and I really enjoy the rides at the park. Transformer ride was the best by far. The staff are friendly and helpful. Food and beverages are quite pricey but it is still okay. Prepare extra money for souvenirs. Drinking fountains are available so you can refill your water bottle easily. Highly suggest to bring a small umbrella or a poncho as the weather can be unpredictable.

Only downside for us was the queue to get in. We were advised to buy our tickets the night before we visited, which we did, to avoid queues and to get there for opening at 10. Seems everyone got the same advice as the line was massive and it took nearly an hour just to get through the gates, even though we had tickets. Once inside it was fine. Suggest getting there around lunchtime as by there there were no queues to get in.

Particularly for young people as it could be a little tiring for senior people.The shows are amazing...particularly the Steven Spielberg show is awesome.Revenge of Mummy ride is just so thrilling... its fun.The other two rides of battlestar galactica had a huge que and we waited for 2 hrs and guess we should have skipped that and covered other shows since to see all the shows and other rides it's not worth waiting so long. Still these two rides were too adventurous.Jurassic park ride with rafting was amazing too.

review_401589541,“Fun but very busy and hot”,"We arrived at 10:30am via the cable car on a Thursday, hoping to beat the crowds but we were mistaken. It was already very crowded and the lines for the most popular rides were between 60-120 minutes. I didn't spend a bunch of money to wait in a hot line for that length of time so we decided to get the Express passes (I assume that's what Universal Studios is encouraging with the long wait times). Although it cost more than the entrance fee, the express passes allowed the kids to actually go on more than a couple of rides, and avoided standing in hot, smelly lines all day. We had burgers at the Diner and we enjoyed those. My favourite ride was the virtual reality Transformers, while my wife enjoyed the roller coaster at Ancient Egypt. My kids enjoyed all the rides but especially the Rapids Adventure at Jurassic park. I also enjoyed the Shrek 4D movie where the seats move and you get sprayed with mist in addition to the usual 3D effects. Take lots of water, or fill your bottles at the many water fountains around the park. Be prepared to spend a lot of money on food and souvenirs if you purchase these things. I recommend you go to the park and determine how long the wait times are for the major rides (roller coasters etc) and if the lines are more than 30min I suggest purchasing the express passes. You will be able to spend more time on rides (3x as many) and much less time standing in lines getting hotter and more annoyed by the minute. If at all possible, do your research and go during an off-peak period! Wish we could have done that.

review_401532572,“Great Family Day Out!”,"We purchased our tickets on line and went for the unlimited express line. We visited on a Thursday. No mater what you read on line about how it wasn't worth it don't believe it! Watching people wait 1 to 2 hours in non air conditioned corridors and lines looked painful. With the express we might have waited 20 mins tops for the Battle Star Galactica roller coaster. All other rides we 10-15 maximum. The Battle Star Galactica/cyclone roller coasters were the most popular. My kids loved the Revenge of the Mummy roller coaster and the transformers. Make sure you take in the lights, camera action show. Very well done. Also did the water world show at 17:00 which was busy but well worth seeing! Food is expensive, most rides make you put you belonging in lockers ($4) so pack light! Spent about S$100 on food for 5 of us. You can easily do the park in a day with the express pass. We arrived at 11:00 and had done some rides 4 times by 7:00pm. Some street shows (B-boys) and non ride activities (Shrek 4D Adventure) for those with squeamish stomachs

You can purchase the express pass from one of the retail outlets inside the park so thats kinda helpful.

But family with kids would enjoy more as its more of a Fun-day out for Kids. For the extreme adrenaline junkies, there are only 2-3 rides. I really liked the mummy ride and transformer rides.

To our disappointment, USS is so small that we finished all the shows/rides in slightly more that half a day. We were expecting long queues and even purchased a Fast Pass before entering the park. Boy, it was such a waste of money! Most rides require less than 20 minutes wait-time even without the pass. (This is actually a plus for most people!) When it comes to food inside the park, choices are very limited. We picked a self-serve cafeteria and staff there are not too friendly.

review_400382422,“Just don't miss it!”,"I stayed in Singapore for more than 3.5 years but never got a chance to visit the Universal Studios. It frequently happens that we miss out good places in our backyard, the same thing happened with me as well.On my wife's birthday July 19, 2016 we decided to pay a visit to Universal Studios Singapore. It was a great visit and forever memorable. Here are a few tips for visitors if it helps!First things first - it's not the place with infants, unless you have someone with you who can take care of infants when you are taking rides. It would be tricky to go with toddlers too as they will not be meeting the minimum height criteria. Most of the rides need kids to be above 122 cm and a few need to be between 100-122 cm. So, decide on the company before you plan to visit.The most important rides are the Transformers Ride, Revenge of Mummy Ride, Jurassic park rapids adventure, 2 giant roller coasters (if you are interested). If possible, try to visit during weekdays and weekends will be completely packed up. We actually visited during middle of week, but still its very much packed. If you can afford a few more bucks, you can even buy a express ticket which has a special queue for almost all the rides. Two options for express ticket - one for single ride and other for multiple rides, costing S$50 and S$70 respectively. It will be useful when the park is full with visitors, you can cover most of the rides with this additional fast lane ticket. In any case, try to be there by 09:45 AM - 10:00 AM.Most of the people head towards the Transformers ride first, it being the premium one but it gets relatively free towards latter half of the day. So, you can go for multiple rides. If you don't want to get the fast lane (express) ticket, either be the first few to board the transformers ride or skip it for latter half of the day. There will be long queues for the big roller coasters - human and cylon. Simple - Human is for humans and Cylon gives a cyclone experience (turns upside down). Go for it if you are able to bear it.Revenge of mummy ride is very good too - super fast roller coaster in complete dark - a different experience. Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure is a good one and you may get soaked in water, so plan accordingly. Try to visit the Water world show at 5:00PM which gives a feeling of watching an action movie in real time. Finally don't skip the dance performances at Rockfeller Center in New York area.it's a must visit and needs 2 days at least to visit everything inside, however with fast lane ticket, you can cover upto 75% of rides on a single day!. Have fun and enjoy!

review_399911099,“Brilliant but expensive”,"Excellent place for a day out. We found the queues to buy a ticket long and hot and the day was very expensive as we felt it was necessary to buy the fast pass ticket as we could not queue for that long with a young child. Although the fast pass did not cover every attraction and some queues with the fast pass were still not remarkably quick. It did save a lot of time. I was impressed by it all, good food options, friendly staff but I think it could be open longer in the day as it shuts quite early. I would like to see more in the way of parades too.

review_399871920,“Second Trip”,"Ha dot go again. Great deal. The 'express pass' is well worth it as waiting time for some rides is ridiculous. The Cylon's line never went down. Even when the park was about to close, there was still a 45 minute (well over an hour) wait time. Was better to go to the Revenge of the Mummy and Transformers. Went on those repeated times with zero wait time that close to closing.

review_399846007,“Amazing Adventure”,"I have been to Universal Studios Sentosa three times and it gets better every time. I would recommend buying tickets In advance, online or from the hop on hop off tours office at Sun Tec. Since all rides are free when inside the attraction there are often wait times so I would also recommend buying jump the que tickets to avoid delays. There are attractions for all ages and I suggest that you experience as much as possible so that there are no regrets. Singers from Mels diner are a great attraction, especially the guys who sing some of the most enjoyable songs.

review_399761790,“Universal whoa”,"Took my 10 year old son to Universal Studios or USS to the local taxi drivers. Cost SGD $10 for the taxi from the center of town. Studio opens at 10am, but be there 30 minutes before to get your tickets or pre-order online. I also got the upgrade to the express pass for another $80 for my son & it was well worth it wben some of the rides had an hour to 2 hours waiting time to ride. The express pass got him in to the ride in 15 to 20 minutes.Lots of roller coasters & lits of screams. It was a really hot day & bought plenty if drinks at $3 each, cheaper than their counterparts elsewhere I've been to.We were at the park 8 hours & my sone got at least 2 rides on each attraction, he thoroughly enjoyed USS.

Conversion rate aside, everything is absolutely fairly priced and of quality - from attractions, decorations, landscaping, souvenirs and food.Huge shoutout and respect for the workers there for their professionalism from performers to attraction operators!The sole con is - the queue is loooooong and viney EVERYWHERE! I visited on a weekday (thursday), it wasn't a public nor school holiday in Singapore or neighbouring country either - the queue for attractions average at above 1 hour (up to 150 minutes, according to announcements: wutt!) One would need special VIP pass to cut the queueing time down. However, at the end of the day, we still managed to play in almost every attractions as the visitors leave the park and the queueing time shortened after 6pm.Great experience overall! Would recommend a more than a day stay in the Sentosa area!

review_399004244,“An Amazing and Fun Day in Universal Studios”,"Ok, so first and foremost, this is a review of my visit couple of months back to Universal Studios Singapore.First thing you see before entering the world of Universal Studios is the Universal symbolic globe which you can't miss to take a picture with. It was a Saturday when I decided to go for some exciting and thrilled ride in Universal Studios. It started out a little easy as you enter the place, you can see some universal characters as you enter a street which looks just like in some movies. There are different characters coming at different time of the day, greeting and entertaining the crowd.So would need to check the timings of your fav. character performing at various location within the studios.As you further come down, you have two options to choose either you can go right or left, basically it doesn't matter as you would like to visit and have experience of everything. For me I decided to go left and start with some of the Madagascar folks, luckily there was a show outside as I arrived wherein the characters from the movie performed to songs, but for me it was King Julien who stole the show with his moves on his trademark song ""I like to move it"", it was a great start for me. Then went to a water ride on the Madagascar section, the ride was nice and slow, and entertaining.I then moved to the next set which was of Shrek, first was the 4D experience of a short video clipping, never experienced anything like that before, it was really an eye opener on the ways an a cinema can be experienced. After coming out of the cinema I came across the Far Far Away Kingdom Palace, it was huge and majestic, really wonderful.Then I moved further to the ""Water World"", it was a replica of the movie set, wherein actors enacted the final fight scene from the movie, with all the fireworks and pyrotechnics. it was really cool.Further moved, to the ""Mummy Returns"" section, boy let me tell you this was one of the rides had lot of fun. In the beginning it seems like a normal roller coaster ride, but as it starts you can feel the fun and excitement sinking within you. The ride is like a underground mine ride, you are taken in to get you a glimpse of the movie through this ride. The ride goes back and forth as you are chased by the mummies. I would recommend for you to definitely try it out.Later, went to Jurassic World, but had to skip it due to the long queue, but took some pics of the robotic dinosaur which was outside and it did looked like a freaking real dinosaur, scary !!!Finally, it was the ride I had the most awesome experience ""Transformers"". I didn't planned on keeping it the last, I never knew at the beginning that I should have not kept this for the very last. I went in the transformers section, stood in the queue for the ride and to my amazement the queue was so HUGE. One might think the queue ends as you enter the building, but no that's just the start. It took me nearly an hour and a half till I actually was on the ride, it was all worth it though. WOW !!! is the first thing comes into my mind just after few seconds it starts. The whole ride is about you actually experiencing that you are in a Transformer movie. I don't know whether we call it a 4D, 5D, 7D or any other dimensional view for it, but GOD it was one amazing experience. I was so amazed by the ride that I wanted to go for another round, but since I already took so much time in the queue for the ride, it was closing time.I personally couldn't manage to complete all of the rides in one day, so would advice if you have time and won't mind spending a bit of money then probably should take a 2 day ticket, so in that way you could easily go through all of the rides and enjoy it as much as you can, it is worth it.Just a bit of an advice, if you planning to go to the studios on a Saturday, then take a note that it closes early than the usual timing on a Saturday. So would better get down there early, but might as well try and go there on a weekday, because on weekends it is more crowded. Also, do check on the weather before heading down there, if it rains or is a thunderstorm, most of the rides are closed. I had a first hand experience of this, it rained half way through the day when I was there and most of the rides where closed and because of which the two rides which are sheltered got busy and had massive queue. So do take time to check the weather, to decide on your visit to Universal Studios.In all it was a wonderful first experience of the place and would surely go back on my next visit.Enjoy your day in Universal Studios

review_398755814,“Good but small park”,"Comparing it to other Universal Studio / Dianey parks, it is much smaller.Visited on a Thursday, park wasn't too full.Bought tickets online (S$60 instead of S$74).Strongly recommend to get there early, be at the Sentosa expreaa station at 0930, buy a ticket for the tram at the machine (S$4, crefit card only) to reach the park by 10, when it opens.Queues were short until 1100 and after 1800. Around 1300-1600 queues for the major rides where 1-2 hours.It rained heavily at 1100, thankfully I had a pair of flip flopa to chabge to. Strongly recommend to bring flip flops + a change of cloths!Transformers and Shrek 4D were nice.The mummy ride was quite good.Human and Cyclon had huge lines (didnt try them).Water world performance was very good!Park was clean, prices inside were reasonable (for a theme park..).Strongest point of the park was decorations. Each of the 7 zones has a unique theme with a lot of small and fun details.If you are looking for a theme park in SG - you should go.If you have other options at Europe / USA - they will probably be better.

We went via MRT, then walked straight over the footbridge ( zero cost ) which has Travelators almost the entire length. We paid at the gate $70 each + 4 X $50 express pass which we rotated around depending on the ride. So worth it walking straight to the front of the line, but remember you can only use the pass once on each ride. All the rides were great, but I thought the Transformers was one of the best rides ever! Super cool. Shrek show is the same as at Movie World Gold Coast. The water world show at 5 pm was good. Food is reasonably priced. The park is not too big so easy on the legs for the day.

review_398384628,“Not well kept; not for small toddlers. ”,"My family was disappointed with this park (mom/dad/2 year old). Our view may be biased because we just visited Tokyo Disney last week, but, I think we'd be disappointed no matter what. Our two year old is short (82cm), and she couldn't go on half the rides. The ones that she could go on we're extremely mediocre. The rides show plenty of wear and are run down. Parts of every attraction weren't working. One ride even broke down on us. They seem to be extremely understaffed; getting on each ride was a free-for-all. They don't always offer the ""single rider"" option they claim to offer (which is miserable when you're alternating rides with your spouse). Bathrooms are hard to find.We spent 3 hours in this park and then left. Honestly, I wish we hadn't come. Don't waste your time in Singapore, go to the Zoo.

review_398261027,“Best theme park in Singapore”,"Second visit to the park, last time was 5 years ago which not many attractions were established. This time, kids (8 y.o.) can play most of the rides already.Express pass (one per attraction) is a must if you plan to take all the rides within one day. Worth the extra bucks. There is another type of pass for unlimited rides for all, but for us; one per attraction is good enough.Got there around 10am. Take a left after the main street, takes the rides, one by one, sit in for shows, or take pictures with the Mascot, we almost finish all rides by 5pm. Then went to the Stunt show near the entrance, a must see.The 4D Transformer almost made me puked. For Roller Coaster, the HUMAN is weaker than the CYLON. Trust me, don't do the Cylon if you have a faint heart. These new Roller coasters didn't have those slow uphill conveyor belt, they just shoot you up and roll.....

review_398153091,“A worthwhile place to visit”,"This was our second visit to universal studios. Our first was when it opened and a few attractions weren't finished so it was great to go back and see everything finished .The park is worthy of its title and is definitely as good as Americas version..We went as a family of 4 for our sons 13th birthday and everyone loved it .Our favourite rides were the mummy and the Jurassic park. Also eating lunch in the Jurassic park restaurant was so authentic we felt like we were in the movie .We did find however less characters roamin around to meet and greet the people which was disappointing from our first visit and also when the park closed there were no characters around bidding us farewell like they did on our first visit . I just felt like there was no love left within the park itself.However if given the chance I would definitely go there again and again. It's a busy day trying to see everything but it can be done in one day. Use your map so you don't waste time wondering where things are. Be prepared for expensive park food and if it's a hot day bring a water bottle each.We also hired a locker which was handy when we all wanted to go on rides together and they were reasonably priced.The water world show is a must it has a really unexpected spectacular ending which will have you gasping.And if you are hot go for the Jurassic park ride I can guarantee you'll be soaked when your done. Overall a worthy place to visit.Enjoy

review_398053760,“Awesomeness ”,"Omg, I can spend three days there, so much fun, festivity and fun rides. Lots to see and do. Suitable for all ages, kids would love it there as they have most cartoon characters like shark and Fiona , puss in boots, Jurassic world, transformer rides, alien stations, ancient Egypt (the scariest ride I've ever been on, but such an adrenalin rush), this is to name a few things to do. Definitely worth a visit or three. Good tip, join the universal club, entrance fee is 75 Singapore dollars a person normally , but with the club card, it costs 150 Singapore dollars which gives two entries plus you get a 30 Singapore dollar meal voucher to use in universal studios or any where on Sentosa island. A real bargain. The card is valid for a year, and ever time you shop, you earn points. Another tip, if your time is limited in Singapore, do universal studios and maybe aquarium one day and the rest of the island another day. The cable car is a good experience to get into the park, but quite expensive, on our second day, we took a taxi straight there and it cost 20 dollars instead of 66 dollars for the cable car.

review_398007801,“Not the most exciting park experience!”,"It's a rather belated review as I had travelled to Universal November 2015. I had travelled with my two daughters both over 12. It was peak holiday season and though we had gone on a weak day the park was quite packed. We already had the Viator pass so didn't need to line up for the tickets but to save time on long queues we decided to get the express pass. The price for it mentioned online was different from what we paid that day- almost double! When I mentioned to them of the rates given online they mentioned that the rates are dynamic and goes by demand and supply. I think that's quite a sham. But we didn't have an option as we had to finish the park in a day so hesitantly paid up. Since the park shuts quite early in the day around 7 pm even with the fast track pass we just about managed to do the major rides and shows, not all though. ( I must admit we started the park late around 10.30 am so that was one of the reasons we had to hurry up for completion of rides. So start early as soon as the park opens up.)Though my kids enjoyed the coasters and other thrilling rides but still they thought it could have been more exciting. If you go with great expectations you would be disappointed. Or if you have already been to theme parks in the U.S. Or Europe, then you may not be that thrilled. That said the park is made very well and have good facilities like lockers, food, shopping etc but they all come with a price. There are lockers next to almost all the rides where you could keep your stuff. Or you could rent locker for the whole day at a nominal price. All said and done it was quite an expensive and tiring day, not worth the price.

A debate for another day. There are rides for the young 2+ and old 80+. This was out first visit since the intertwined battlestar gallactica rides Humanoid (red) and or vs. Cyclon (blue) had reopened. To be honest the whole attraction is quite lame without these two rides. There are now about 10 - 12 rides with four or five having a ""scream"" factor (Mummy, dragon, transformers and the Two BGs already mentioned). There are performers aplenty, who sing and dance and run about scaring people then stopping for the photo opportunities that are soooo needed in Asia. Food and beverage outlets cater to western and Asian tastes. Toilets are close at hand and are of a high standard. One note of warning. The queues for the top rides can grow to more than an hour between 1045 and 1530. Unless you are and early starter and/or late finisher, it may be worth investing in a limited (one shorter queue per 14 attractions) or unlimited express pass (SGD50 and 70 respectively). There is shade and plenty of areas to sit or cool down but it can be hot in the sun due to the concrete and architecture.

review_397814508,“Not so great”,"If you DO NOT have a great love for theme parks I would recomend dodging this attraction. Long lines for short rides. There are better ways to spend a day in Singapore.On the positive side the rides once you get on are pretty good maybe not worth a 2 hour wait but I could justify a 1 hour wait. Food was surprisingly good. Layout of the park is also spot on.HOT TIP, Buy an express pass and maybe go later in the day as the lines seemed to die down by mid to late afternoon. This will be no issue as the park is open until 10PM

review_397699508,“Fun for older kids and teenagers”,"I visited USS with my husband and 2 kids aged 5 and 7. The rides are fun and exciting but they are not suitable for children at this age group. It will probably be more suitable for older children and teenagers who like exciting rides. My girls only enjoyed the merry go round and the 4D shriek movie. The rest of the attractions are either they cant go in due to height constraint or for those that they can play, they dont quite enjoy it. For adults, it is meant for those who like such exciting rides.

review_397437987,“Must Do”,"I love theme parks and Universal Singapore did not disappoint. I really recommend everyone to visit, but do some planning around your visit though as it can be done in one day if you pay the extra for a Fast Pass. We went at the end of April and the park was really busy and we made it to all major attractions [barring a 2 small attractions like the how movies are made and the attraction that's like Twister from the Orland US which I had seen already] and had about 45 minutes to shop around for the children. We got to the theme park around 30 min after it opened and had no queue to get in as we had bought our tickets online. I do suggest to buy online as there was a Mastercard discount of 10% that is running. The one setup back is that I also bought the fast-pass tickets online and that was a little bit of a challenge as you have to keep your printed ticket with you for the entire time as at each attraction they mark it off - I assumed they would give us some kind of arm band. Keep this in mind as you need to keep it either in a wallet or bag so that it doesn't get damaged. We bought the normal fast pass which allows for only a single use fast pass [and not unlimited]; we felt this was adaquate as we had no intention on riding any rides more than once. The rollercoasters are the only time you will encounter a long line, we waited for approx 20 min with our fast pass tickets for the Human rollercoaster and about 15 min for Cylone. All the other lines were approx 5 min to wait with the fast pass tickets. For the Puss in Boots adventure, it might be better to use the single rider queue as the ride has 3 seats in a row and thus this queue sometimes moves faster. My only other suggestion when moving through the park is to ""go right"" through Sci-Fi City, do the transformers and then the big coasters. Then back track a bit to ""go left"" starting with Madagascar. The park is circular so this is what we did and we ended at the Mummy. I found this to be easy and I felt we had fewer lines at the attractions. Dining: I cannot comment here as we just had a snack in the park of pizza and a few beers. There were lots of of options though of Asian, Indian and Western. We had a good dinner in Resorts World outside the actual park.

review_397293541,“An expensive disappointment ”,"We went to Universal studios Singapore for 1 day. We were first met with a hefty sum of about 74 SGD per person, hurts in the wallet for a student. Anyway, after the entry fee we were expecting alot, but we were quickly disapointed. Altough i have give props to Universals studios Singapore for the park design. It was very atmospheric and can be enjoyed by kids aswells as grown ups, a simpel walk around the park just looking was fun. Although the disappointment started when you were looking at the rides. First of there were very few of them, under 15. And all of them had 30 mins + queue times, most of the popular rides which we were looking at were up to 60-90 mins queue. We queued for 60 mins and got little joy out of the 5 min ride. Merch was cramped in every possible location with their logo printed over every thing, nothing was to exciting. Although kids would probably love it. Food inside was decent, the atompsheric restaurants sure looked appealing but the food didn't live up to the expectations. PS: We met a couple from Japan who had been to both universal studios Los Angels & Japan. They told us that Singapore was a disappointment in both size and enjoyment compered to the others. Could be good to keep that in mind if you have high expectations and been to the others.Positive: Atmosperhic, Good for families with kids, good facilites, Free wi-fi in the entire park Negative: Looong queue times(got lower towards the end of the day), expensive for what you get, a bit smallUniversal studios Singapore is good for families, kids would love it. Waiting is part of the game in these amusment parks. But for us it wasnt out most enjoyable day in Singapore.

This first time i went with my family, Second time was with my friends and this time with my wife. Well, its very romantic. New attractions such as the puss in boots roller coaster is great. It is still clean from a few years that i went there. There is still a few weeks till soak out even finishes where there is a wet party and you will see your favorite characters walking about such as the minions, cookie monsters and cast from sesame streets. Even the concert event which was the monster rock has changed to sesame streets. I am gonna still be visiting universal studios in the future. It is easy to get here with just an mrt, or i used the singapore cable car. Besides the universal studios are tons of other places to visit.

review_396988923,“a very sorry place....”,"Singapore is well known for many attractions - most top quality - an excellent experience coupled with a fair value. Started on the Madagascar ride. Once boarding a boat - I was told to take my cap off and put down the safety bar. Fast ride? big drops? few bumps? Non of the above. Almost impossible for a cap to come off, and the safety bar - must have saved my life as I did manage not to be captured. As for the park - they fail to mention it's probably the least clean place in all of Singapore. Streets, sidewalks and especially cafes filled places not to put your feet. Table tops - at the one place we did stop - gross. As for value - that's a personal decision. The children I went with while bored much of the time - did manage to have some fun. Fast Pass is a must.... for those who can afford it.

review_396626139,“Get the Express Pass”,"My advice to anyone visiting is to plan ahead on which rides you are most keen on and plan when you are going to visit. Rides like Transformers and Revenge of the Mummy are going to have looong waiting times. We spent 60 min in line waiting for Transformers at 2 pm however when we passed by later at 7.30, the waiting time was only 5 min. So, that's something to consider. (This was on a Monday, so I can only imagine what it must be on a weekend). You could do the 'kiddie' rides first like those in Madagascar and Far Far Away and then head to Lost World and Sci Fi City. Some rides are extremely childish though, so again, plan ahead. We waited 40 min to go on Treasure Hunters and that was so disappointing I can't even put it in words! If you can afford it, take the Express Pass. Waiting in these long lines, takes away some of the fun and its extremely frustrating seeing the Express Pass people waltz to the front of the line.Food inside is surprisingly not as expensive as anticipated and there's a good variety so we were pretty pleased with that. There's an Indian restaurant in the Ancient Egypt section.

I went there on Thursday and still i got to queue for 1 hour for Jurrasic Park ride which is the ride is just like less than 10 minutes.Another tips is, go queue there before the open gate (10am), so you could go in faster. After you in, go to the popular rides first (Transformer, The Mummy, Jurrasic Park), because when its still morning, the rides wont be too crowded. Dont take a picture or go to shops first. You can do that later after you take all the popular rides.

review_396569693,“Must go place when you are in Singapore”,"It is a different world all together. A world of movies and cartoons! You be at this place and suddenly you start feeling that you are also part of the reel world. You get to see all the famous characters like Charlie chaplin, Minions, Shrek, Cleopatra, Puss in the boots etc. etc. Would suggest anyone planning to visit the place to get there as early as possible ( I think it starts at around 9 am).One day can be easily spent at this place. The studio is divided in different zones - Transformers world, Egyptian World, Jurrasic Park, Fairytale world and so on. Mine and my family's personal favourites were Transformers and Jurrasic Park. The must try ride there is the immersive 3D transformer ride, where you get a chance to feel as a part of the transformer movie. It is just awesome. The other one was the Jurrasic PArk ride, where you go in a group on a boat, fall from a waterfall and flow through a river stream surrounded by different sorts of dinosaurs. While you visit all the places and rides, there are also several theatres, where shows go on. My suggestion is - pick your show wisely, as every minute spent is precious. You for sure don't want to get stuck in a boring show just to realize later that you are out of time and missed out on an awesome ride. (e.g. there is one talking donkey show, pls avoid it if it is still there). The studio closes at sharp 6.30 pm. so plan accordingly. Have a fun gala time and don't forget to take loads of pics with your favourite characters and settings. :)

Yes, I know they are not real, but for that moment all of it felt real and magical. The Sesame Street Show, was as much as fun! really enjoyed it, and the after-show outside the theatre was a lot of fun. Loved meeting the Minions, the themes within the park are well made, and really enjoyable. There are plenty of shops to spend more money on merchandise :) and food as well!The roller-coasts looked like a lot of fun based on all the screams I heard:P, but that's as close as I got to it :)The Shrek, Donkey, Puss and Boots, Madagascar themed plays, rides and meet and greets were quite nice as well, even for us adults. The Jurassic Park theme was quite cool, and the ride was almost too real :) The Lost Kingdom (return of the Mummy ride etc), we couldn't visit because it was difficult with small children. But looked fun!All in all, I can't wait to go back :) spent the whole day there and didn't feel the time go at all!Important note: If you don't want to wait in long queues (sometimes waiting time for rides are as much as 45 mins), please do yourself a favor and buy the ""Express Pass"" along with your entrance ticket. This definitely made the difference, as we didn't spend more than 10 minutes for any rides waiting. Also the meet and greet are only for a short time (max 15 mins) and at scheduled times each day. So plan your rides accordingly if you don't want to miss any of the meet and greets!

Okay, there are a number of rides, but the waiting time (unless you paid special membership of course) was ridiculous - in fact anything over a 15 minute wait is, well, a complete waste.

It's a good idea to get an express pass as some of the queues are very long and it will save you lots of time. Experience shrek in 4D where you not only see and hear but also feel the actions. Walk down Hollywood and jive to the beats of the cruisers and other street entertainments. Get ready to be soaked in the live, sensational action show with stunts and thrills at the water world. Most importantly do not miss 'light, camera, action!'-hosted by Steven Spielberg. It's a marvellous experience.

review_395651937,“Don't Bother if You've Experienced Other Theme Parks”,"Our whole family were highly disappointed. As a family of 4 (2adults 2 kids) it cost $460 to get in with the express pass option (Express option was $50extra p/p and unlimited express was about $20 more) $460!! Ouch!! and not all rides had the fast pass option. We went on a week day and that was crowded enough so I would hate to be there in the weekend. The park is only small and we were able to do most of it in 5 hours. If you have done other decent theme parks, then don't bother and save your money for eating.

review_395474924,“Short vacation in Singapore ”,"Well, it was fun, the place was clean and the staff was great. The roller coasters were good and the Transformer ride was super , our fav. Probably nothing new but the the food sucked and was stupid expensive, maybe that's just amusement parks, this is my first visit to one in 10 years or so. But, a hotdog and fountain soda was $8.75 USD and ....... Well it sucked and who serves hot gods without onions????? Anyway all in we had a fun day and we paid $96 USD for here and the SEA Aquarium. You can add an express pass for $22.50 to $37.50 which allows you to cut in line for all the attractions. Wish we'd know because it would have been worth it. The shops were even worse than the food, a Heresy Bar re size $2.62 or Cookie Monster $30 USD. Ok I whined enough, a nice day and lots of other stuff to do on the the island.

review_395450808,“Very well for such a small park”,"It is not the best attraction park in the world, but it definitely worth a visit. First, the park and its thematic zones and attractions have very good style due to the connection with Universal. Decorations are almost perfect, and each ride is accompanied by a unique atmosphere. Second, even the park is really small, it still has at least 5 large and interesting attractions. Third, its zones are located in a comfortable and compact circular way. Therefore, you could walk it through rather fast. One day will be more than enough to visit all attractions using Express ticket.However, the price is large (especially compared to the European parks), so someone could be disappointed.

The battle star ride was epic.

review_395381677,“Great fun for all ages”,"Great fun to spend a day with kids, we have been there a few times. Value for money from the express pass. Advanced ticket booking strongly recommended (easy via internet and self-printing of tickets) as that saves a LOT of time at the entrance. The express pass ensures quick entry to all attractions, but only once. By the time you have done everything, the park already calms down, and second/third/fourth entries to favourite rides are really easy without too much waiting. Absolute must-do: Transformers. When we were there the battlestar galactica rollercoasters were closed already for a while ( open now again, I heard). I never heard the reson for (prolonged) closure, but I am not sure I want to know.

review_395351066,"“Seriously, buy the Express Unlimited Ticket ”","If you wanna enjoy USS at it best, buy the Express Ticket.. Seriously worth it! Especially when you came a little late..You don't wanna wait in the long line for hours just to get in one ride and waste your whole day!And, it feels good to go through the special line while passing a long line full of people in the other line #nooffense ✌You can litterally enjoy both Cylon and Human rollercoaster while the other are still queuing for one of them.. Rollercoaster has a lot of fans.. Of course you should try it.. If you have normal ticket, Cylon ride is better.. I would recommend Transformers and Battlestar Galactica in Sci-Fi City Zone, Revenge of the Mummy in Ancient Egypt Zone, and Amber Rock Climb in Lost World.. The other is your choice.. Foods and drinks are quite expensive so you can figure something out like treat your belly well before arrive at the USS and bring some water with you.. Enjoy your time!

review_394932854,“Get your tix for HALLOWEEN NIGHTS!!!”,"The only reason I go to USS is to satisfy my hunger for the macabre: Their annual scare fest during Halloween. I must say lat year they really top themselves with 4 brilliant haunted houses ~ Haunted MRT (with simulated motion), Siloso Gateway Block 50 (a haunted HDB with zombies apocalypse), Hell House (with scorching temperature of Hell) and Tunnel People (can literally smell the damp earth and feel the moist surface). All so marvellously done that I couldn't select a fave. The 3 scare zones was also wonderfully executed.Compared to 2014 which was mediocre, and 2013 which was much better than 2014. I am so looking forward to this year's and I'm praying that USS will push its buttons to the limit to try and scare the socks off my feet!I highly recommend purchasing the Express Pass to shorter queues. For this highly anticipated event, many will bound to buy the Express Pass but it still make queuing shorter compared to Normal Pass.

review_394923673,“Short Holiday break”,"This is my 2nd visit to Universal Studio Singapore and I must say I am really disappointed. My first visit was filled with surprises, dressed characters going around and engaging with people, etc. This time, there was only one - Frankenstein and that was it! The place looks seriously short of staff and there was no proper control of the crowd which to me can be really dangerous as this is a kids playground as well. To highlight what I meant . We queued up for a good two hours to play the water-raft. That was fine, what was not fine was that when we got onto the float, the staff made what I called cursory checks on whether all of us were properly belted up. The aunty next to us had so many stuff with, a couple of bags including a bag-pack, I wonder how she was allowed to get on in the first place. To make matters worse, the staff checking on the safety belts, just shouted - make sure you put on your safety belt without personally inspecting everybody! This aunty did not put on her belt and when we asked her to, she says no need, I am alright! What if she gets flung off her the float? Who is to blame? The air cond was also really bad even in the food court. The only place enjoyable unsurprisingly is the place where they sell the souvenirs! I am seriously doubtful, I will come to this theme park again in the future.

I have not gathered the guts yet to go on the Battlestar Galectica ride (cos I will lose said guts). My fave is the Mummy Ride, which thrills more than the one in the USA. Did the cheesy tourist shots with the characters - Puss in Boots being my fave cavalier! The lines and waits are of course irritating but it is so worth it.

review_394577988,"“Expensive day, but fun...”","Singapore's Universal Studio was a bit of a mix for us. We decided to go all out and get the $70 each extra (on top of ticket prices) for the unlimited express rides pass. Figuring we would not be doing this again for a long time. There are several rides not included in this, which personally annoyed me considering the cost, but as it was they were aimed at the younger kids anyway. If we had not got these the lines were a minimum of 40 minutes per ride. The food court we went to was not great and very expensive for what we got. On whole however the kids and my hubby had a great day, going on rides multiple times with only a few minutes to line up. Teenagers will love this place!!!! We finished our day off with an exorbitant costly ride on the cable car back to the main land.... But once again, how often will you do this? I can recommended this to any adrenalin junkies who enjoy fast rides. If you are like me and don't.... Do not trust your husband and kids when they tell you it's a tame ride!!!

However, our expectation and reality did not match start from the entrance long queue around 20 minutes. But we are still ok as the impression of the studio is pretty amazing. As soon as we got inside, we would like to try the Transformer Ride and start the queue. However, when we reach in the middle, they announced that the waiting time will last 1:30 hrs. We was astonishing and couldn't believe the situation. Of course, it really did takes 1:30 hrs just for around 2 minutes ride. Another amazing rides are Revenge of the Mummy, Cyclon and Human. Because of long queue in every amazing, we did not have much fun in this amazing place. We also did not have enough time for Far Far Away, Madagascar, and The Lost World. I assumed that it is not worthy for nearly 70 $ not including the food. In Bangkok, like Dream World, Siam Park City, I had more fun riding a lot of roller coasters all day and the ticket fees is more cheap. Not crowed this much also.

Even with Express Pass, the wait times for the Battlestar Galactica coasters were still north of 30 minutes each.The theming of the lands is fantastic and completely immersive, Far Far Away is of particular note. The variations of the attractions from what can be found in the US theme parks was also appreciated. Even though the name was the same for Jurassic Park, it was a pleasant surprise what the ride turned out to be.Using the Express Pass allowed me to complete the park with the half day I had. I was also able walk around and take pictures shortly after park close before exiting the park.Overall I enjoyed Universal Studios Singapore and would return in the future with more time to fully explore the theming and shops of the park.

Waiting time for boring attractions (like a slow ride for kids) ranges between 30 and 60 minutes, and for anything even slightly exciting about 90 minutes. The Battlestar Galactica roller coaster makes you wait 180 minutes. Yes, that's a whopping three hours. Waiting in the heat, for a single roller coaster ride. I guess I finally found out Universal Studios' business model. First charge 75$ entrance fee, don't deliver anything, just to make people buy the Express pass.Fraud, if you ask me. Plain and simple.

review_393746848,“Awesome day for the family!”,"Very good, would definately recommend spending a whole day there. A friday has later close at the time of 9pm, and make sure to stay for the fireworks at 9.30pmWould definately recommend getting there at opening and going to the transformers ride- it is a ride you cannot miss!Food/ merchandise a bit pricy- but nothing too over the top for a theme parkWould definately recommend buying tickets on Klook- got tickets for $60 instead of $75, so definately can save some money with big families- just print out the tickets or show on mobile at the gate- no hassle in lining up for tickets!

You can leave the park and re-enter and i recommend you do this for lunch no need to pay over the top for the food available in the park.

review_393532698,“Universal studio with family”,"We went there on Saturday , it was crowded. Covered 80% of the studio including major rides. Balance we completed next day. As usual transformer ride (F4) was the first one but took 90 minutes in the Que, then two roller coasters took 90 minutes .Moved to Jurassic river adventure and Revenge of mummy. We liked revenge of mummy and it was thrilling and more adventurous than transformer ride. After 6pm we found there is no que for rides so we repeated some of them F1,F2,f3 and F4 in transformers and revenge of mummy, Jurassic river 2 to 3 times.Good thing: Good food . Halal food available. Prayer area available.Staff is much friendly and helping type. Negative: Should be better method of crowd management. For example if there is long line in transformer ride then some of them can be advised to go for other rides such as revenge of mummy, Jurassic river ride etc.Overall experience ..not as great as Universal studio Orlando.It was bright sunny day but OK for rainy day also

Highly recommend the front of line unlimited express pass. We got to walk past so many people in 40 minutes plus line ups and got straight onto rides.

review_393317300,“Kids enjoyed it”,"We have been to the LA Universal and if you have been here the Singapore one will be a little on the boring side. It is a theme park and my kids did have a ball here and my daughter did not want to leave. I thought it was very small but obviously Singapore doesn't have the land for a huge theme park. My kids enjoyed all the rides and we purchased the front of the line ride pass for them so they could have plenty of rides. If you can afford to do this and your kids love rides then I would otherwise there can be long waits for the rides. Try and pick a cooler day to attend as it gets very very hot and can be quite draining. We also found that by the afternoon about 3pm the crowds had disappeared and the wait times for the rides was only about 5 to 10 mins. Not sure if this happens everyday but it did when we were there. Take plenty of water. There are bubblers there though

review_393179234,“Overrated and overpriced. ”,"This park lacks the variety or quantity of rides that would justify the admission fee. There was nothing throughout the day that made us feel like we had value for money. Especially not the 'fireworks show' that we were told would be worth waiting around for, and would last 'around fifteen minutes' (though it actually lasted five minutes).The fast track queuing system was not consistent from ride to ride, or when members of staff switched roles to direct riders to the boarding areas. When one of the rides was shut down due to the weather, there were groups of people who were just allowed to queue jump, as we were given the option to stay or leave. The waiting times were not anywhere near reflective in reality, partly due to the mismanagement of priority customers. On one ride we waited over two hours, despite the time stated being 40 minutes.Later on towards the end of the day, there was the opposite problem, with signs saying 50 minutes but then only took about 10 minutes.It just didn't feel like you were in a top class facility throughout the day, around the world there are many superior venues - but I guess not so much in Singapore!

review_393162929,“Horrific management of queues - terrible customer service - do not go here with young children.”,"I went to Universal Studios on Friday 15th July with my five year old and seven year old daughters. It was raining so most of the rides were closed which meant that there were only a few rides and shows open. We went on the Madagascar ride firstly which we queued a while for but was ok and organized. Secondly we queued for the Shrek show in the Palace and this is when it all went horribly wrong. We queued patiently in a long line in the dark and people started pushing and shoving forward... all ok until the queue broke and we were all unleashed into a dark waiting area before the performance room... there was no order and there was lots of pushing and shoving. My girls were being knocked about and grown men were being pushed right up against us. Just when we thought the doors to the show were about to open another door opened and a stream of people from a totally different waiting area were let in.. literally 100 of them. The mood in our particular room became almost desperate and panicky. Finally the rope was lifted and everyone just ran for it with no order. The universal studios rep had no control really. We finally got into the stadium and by that state we were so panicky that we ran out of the fire exit and ended up outside by the some bins where a lovely cleaner calmed us down. We never saw the show and it was a petrifying experience. The girls and I went to the fairy shop and one more very gentle ride before going to guest services where clearly I was crying and in shock. They said no money back and gave us universal studio mugs for our trouble... Seriously terrible. I wasn't in a state of mind to argue so asked them please to work it out as we needed to go back to the safety of our hotel to calm down. I gave them hotel Shangri La Sentosa and room number and they never got back to us. I also e-mailed them and again nothing. I simply can not believe their lack of care. Somebody will get hurt in the queues and they seriously need to look into customer service. Perhaps they believe they are a big company so can get away with it.

review_393142169,“The best place to spend a day”,"We planned to go to Universal before we came, were very excited for that. It was a big place with so many games that you could spend a whole day long. We started with Transformer game, then Dragon fly, then the revenge of Mummy...it was a long queu even we came on Monday. The advice for you is getting a map and decide to choose games first, because you cant join all of them. We got a good day out. Will do it again if have chance.

review_393128317,“2nd visit a lot busier”,"Having visited this park 5 years ago we were excited to rein-act the same awesome day we had previously had. A couple of mistakes on our behalf added to us not living the dream on the day of our visit. This trip we decided to take the MRT to Vivo city & catch the monorail whereas last visit we took a taxi direct to entrance. Arriving at Vivo city we encountered a huge number of people joining us for USS. The first part of our day in joining a lengthy queue. We had purchased the standard tickets based on our previous trip where the express ticket was not necessary. This time we encountered waiting times of 2 hours! In the end after doing a few of the shows we decided to leave the park & did the Segway later returning for rides - still with a wait time of 45 mins for the popular rides. It was very clear that on this day it would have been a wise move to purchase the express ticket- at least for our teens. If you have not done the park I still think it is a good day out but unless you want to spend much of your day queuing- I would suggest the express tickets. Head straight to the rear of the park & do rollercoasters & Transformer rides 1st. The American diner had good food- pizza, soup & drink value meal that was delicious.

We are booked from Wendy Tickets at concessional rates. Getting there was also very convenient by the Sentosa Express monorail. Of all the rides, those we liked most are Transformers, Cylone (be at the front row) and Jurassic Park among others. Plenty of food options around. Each ride had a Q of 30-45 mins. This took most of the time. There is a premium ticket option available which was not known to us. This wud hv helped us save a lot of time as there is no Q for that.

We started with the Minions before proceeding to the Transformers , Madagascar, Puss in boots Jurassic Park , the Mummy Dragon and other Roller. Coasters , Shrek and Sesame Street . The rides. Can be enjoyed by Children and adults alike . The express pas meant that we didn't have to wait in long queues . There was free wifi and many points .

review_393074680,“Go early or leave Late to beat the queues”,"This Universal studios is one of the smaller ones, so during peak season, expect long queues. If you have the money, buy the express passOne of the most fun rides for kids 7 years and up and adults is Canopy rider, Jurassic Park Rapids adventure. If you are heading for these rides, either be the first in the park or the last to leave, as that is when the queues start disappearing. For lunch, you can eat at Loui's NY Pizza Parlour, as you get a huge pizza, drinks and soup for the whole family. The package deal is quite affordable for the family.If you are on a tighter budget, exit the Park, and head for the Malaysian Food Street. If you want Western, head towards Mcdonalds, where the Golden Arches can always be counted on.

review_393050795,“Great day! ”,"This is a great park. As others have said Transformers is fantastic. We had the ultimate express pass & got on this 5 times during the day. The staff on this ride were super friendly, especially the guy on the entrance (15th July 8pm), as were all staff (except a grumpy snack restaurant manager by the lake). The express pass was worth every cent, but if you can't do it, the park gets much quieter between 6.30-8.30pm and wait times reduced to 5 mins for everything then. Food & drink are expensive. We left the park for an hour & went to Chillies in Sentosa instead but this was just as expensive ($70 for 2 burger meals & a side of mash) so I would suggest going to Mc Donald's instead which is a 2 minute walk from the park! If you bring a bottle, you can refill it from the water fountains, but I didn't like the taste of the water at all (I drink a lot of water & this has a strange after taste, so we poured it back out & paid the crazy money to buy some). One of the rides that you can't use express pass for is canopy flyer, which we returned to around 7pm & did twice as wait time was only 5 mins. This is an awesome ride and you can see the city lights from the top at night, which is wonderful. First time we went on it, we were allocated a backwards seat, so second time we asked for one that went forwards & this was much better. An excellent ride, v short but v enjoyable. I would definitely recommend the park and ultimate express pass for a great day out & would definitely return!

review_392937470,“Cool and Fun Holiday”,"I was reading some reviews about this first before we went to the park. But in real-life experience (the weather's bad, cloudy and rain since morning also humid) I thought no one's gonna go to the park (of course i was wrong - silly me), if you are late coming to the park like me, I found that the itinerary that worked for me and my family, will be like this:(Started at 10.30am)- Go to Jurrasic Park rapid adventure (1) and buy disposable poncho and go for the ride- Run to Waterworld, 30mins before it starts, wear your poncho and sit in soak seat area, you'll get great view and fun experience- Go to Transformer or the Mummy, whichever has shortest queing time, I will choose the Mummy (2) and return to the transformer on a later time, the waiting time for Transformer is shorter if you ride on the evening (0 mins)- Eat at Friar's or Goldilock at Far and Away area, you need to fuel up your stamina (and delicious too) then chills and relax by watching shrek adventure- go to Battlestar Galactica then ride for Human (3) (on my experience the waiting time on the afternoon 'only' 45 mins, but somehow I didn't have to wait at all)- Cooling down your brain first or just go to Cylon (4) for your next roller coaster experience- then go ride the Transformer (5) to wrap up your must-ride attractions- don't forget to see Lights, Camera, Action, for its amazing special-effect making- then choose any ride/show that you want to try, eventhough I didn't get all the rides, at least I have tried the 5 must-ride attractions on my list ^_^But next time, if I go in holiday time like this, I would probably save some money to buy the express pass

We were 4 adults and 3 kids ( important info , children below 4 years go free) , and there was not much for the kids of this age. Also in the US we took the front of the line pass and that came in handy , here there wer only 2-3 rides where we actually used this pass ,else most of the rides had short wait lines (we had gone on a weekday but during peak tourist season). SO if you are going on a weekday perhaps a usual ticket should be good enough . Also for people travelling with infants , there are a couple of feeding rooms , so that is helpful . Also there are multiple eating options ,overall a fun day.

review_392735805,"“Wear sunscreen, deodorant, and go to ""Guest services""!”","It is a decent amusement park, but.... It is hot and humid in Singapore and feels even hotter at USS, especially after going indoors for some of the rides or shows, then going outdoors again. Even if it is cloudy or rainy, across a full day at USS you WILL get hot and sweaty - which is very evident when people get into the monorail or free bus at the end of the day! (It's actually quicker to take the bus back to Vivocity than the monorail). It is likely to be packed on any day that Singaporean kids are not at school (check scheduled school holidays and public holidays at the MOE website). The queues are long (even with the express pass, you may still have to wait 10-15 minutes). Even if the queue lines look to be under shade, it can still be hot in the queues and the late afternoon sun comes in at an angle and can still burn. Water fountains are mostly located in the queue lanes, so remember to fill up your water bottle at every chance! Don't expect to find free water anywhere near a food outlet! (Note: you CAN bring in your own food and drink- in plastic bottles - but don't make it look like a ""picnic"" - which is officially not allowed.) The most frustrating thing is trying to plan your day so that you can see the shows you want, in between waiting for your favourite rides (which will have the shortest queues in the first and last hours of the day): The show times are not indicated on the website, nor on the physical map you collect after entering the theme park. I suggest you go to Guest Services (on the left after you enter the turnstiles) and ask them to tell you the times and locations for shows like WaterWorld (a great stunt show - see photo), The Sesame Street Show, the various street entertainment shows, and Hollywood Dreams Parade and Lake Hollywood Spectacular (only shown on weekends and some public holidays). Good luck!

Our children are 9 and 6 (6 year old is tall for his age), 9 yo allowed on all the rides and the 6 yo all but two. He didn't mind though as it was getting towards the end of the day and he was tired. Get there early as there is a line to get in even if you have your tickets. The signs and literature say no food or drink and mandatory bag check, no one checked our bag and I saw tons of people with their own food. I probably still wouldn't have packed it because we didn't want to carry stuff around the food. We brought a change of clothes and stored it right away in the lockers. Pick up a map and a print out of the shows for the day. I got lucky in the sense that we stumbled upon the two shows I wanted to see. Waterworld - YES! We had a magicial fun filled day!

Also make sure to buy the express pass for an extra $50 as this allows you to skip the ride queue (some rides have up to a 50minute wait). There are plenty of rides for people of all ages and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful if you have any questions. Although the prices for food and drink were quite reasonable, it is a good idea to take a water bottle along as they have drink fountains in the bathrooms and around the park that you can fill up at.

review_392498795,“Annual / Season Pass is worth it”,"We just signed up for a season pass this June and we have been to the park almost every week. We visited once on a Monday which is surprisingly more crowded compared to Saturday's we have been there. On Saturday we will arrive the park at around 1900hrs after my 4 year old's swim class. We like to come at this time because most of the visitors are done for the day so it means lesser or no waiting time at all. If you are lucky and the attendant is nice and the Q is not long you can ask if you can just ride again without re-queuing, but of course if you happen to see the Q is long please be courteous enough to Q again.Rides recommend for the not so adventurous toddlers: (note: there are other rides but O will concentrate on where we frequently go)1. King Julien's Beach Party-go-round is a family carousel. This is one of the our boy's fave. He can hop on to one Madagascar character to the other all night while the parents seat on the stationary seats.2. Dino SoarinYou can ride on the back of flying dinosaurs soaring up into the sky or plunging down into the shadows. There is a button which you have to press and HOLD so the dinousaur will fly high. Tip: Number 4 dinousaur is the best seat in this ride as there are no sudden drop feeling after you release the button to go down unlike 6 and 7. 3. Spaghetti Space ChaseThis a slow ride, inside is a bit dark. Can sit 4 in 1 cabin. This is a space mission for Elmo and Super Grover to stop a plot of stealing spaghetti from earth. Sometimes my son gets bored though.There are pram and wheelchair rental inside the park. Cardholders get a $5 off for the pram.Parade and Fireworks are only available on weekends. Tip: sit at the staircase near Marty's Casa del wild food court for an uninterrupted view. Be sure to be early as people start sitting 30mins before.It is also worth it to buy the souvenir bottle at $11 (I bought it with slushie) as you can refill it with a slushie at $5 or a softdrinks for $2. They clean the bottle for every refill.

It would be good if you can buy the tickets online as there is very much rush at the counters and buying tickets online can save you hours. There are mostly Roller Coaster rides in Universal Studios. Visit the official website for any other events during your time of visit.

review_392428245,“Great day out!”,"We had a great day here with friends and our mix of young teens and children. A good mix of rides and entertainments for all ages. Recommend the express pass to get through queues faster. The Waterworld show was quite spectacular, and was definitely a highlight. Not a lot of space to sit and wait for rides to finish, but plenty of cafes and eateries. Starbucks near the entrance is the safest bet for coffee.

review_392368517,“Excellent Day Out at Universal Studios Singapore”,"USS is definitely a great place to visit if you have a day free with nothing to do in Singapore. I spent the whole day there (10am-730pm) and managed to fill my time doing things. The park is pretty much designed for children and young adults, though there are a number of rides that adults will enjoy as below:1) the roller coasters - Human versus cyclon. Cyclon is by far the better option - and will give you the most exhilarating ride in the whole park. Human is a good warm up for Cyclon. Waiting times vary between 20-60 mins2) Transformers - The Ride - highly-recommended, a 4D experience not to be missed. Waiting times vary between 20-45 mins 3) Jurassic Park - Rapids Adventure - riding within a 9-rider raft/ boat through the rapids, more for children, only one plunge at the end of the ride worth any mention. This had the longest waiting time (up to 90 mins)4) Revenge of the Mummy - again it is a roller coaster with some riding in the dark - children will like them. Waiting time can be up to 40 mins Other interesting rides are generally for children - Madagascar Adventure, Canopy Ride at Jurassic Park, Shrek 4D experience, Puss in Boots, etc. I would suggest (if you can spare the cash) - fork out the extra SGD70 for unlimited express. This allows you to skip all queues (including one to enter USS!). The longest I waited with this pass was 15 minutes for the rapids - all the others I went right to the front of the line. Some rides are definitely worth exploring time and again (like Transformers and Cyclon) - so this pass comes in very handy. And rides become pretty empty towards the end of the day (between 5pm and 7pm) - so these are good times to explore the park and the rides. There are plenty of eateries within the park to choose from. There are lockers to store things as well.

review_392202511,“Must visit!!”,"First suggestion would be take attest a 2 days pass. We planned it only for a day and wanted to do so much more. We had booked the tickets in advance so skipped the ticket queue. But there were long waiting queues for most of the rides. So we upgraded and got the express (skip the line) tickets, which definitely was worth it. We almost did all the rides, but couldn't manage some shows and activities. My little girl was super excited with the Shrek show. We all enjoyed the Transformers too. We were here specially to celebrate our girls's fifth birthday and she was super happy and excited with our surprise. A visit to this place is definitely worth it despite the long queues.We visited here in August 2013, but couldn't select this year option for my review.

However as a personal opinion, I prefer the Universal Studios in Singapore over the Universal Studios in Orlando. The rides here in Singapore are really clean and thrilling. They also have rides that are meant for everyone, no matter what age. In general the queues are not very long if you visit on an off peak day, and there are many food options, no doubt expensive. The entire park is very clean and there are many facilities for disabled people as well. There are water coolers all around the park so getting drinkable water is really easy on a hot day! The locker system is really good as well, as you can ensure the safety of your belongings! I would really recommend visiting Universal Studios Singapore, whether you're a tourist or a local!

The place is so balanced in terms of distribution of themed attractions. If you fancy adrenaline rush, go ahead and enjoy the Battlestar Galactica. Make sure to ride the red one (Human) first before taking on the blue (Cyclone). Cyclone is the more intense ride. If you fancy a kiddie type of fun, there are many options available. The queue wasn't too bad. The longest wait we saw was 65 mins so we decided to just return when the crowd is thinner. Waterworld, Transformers, The Mummy, Battlestar Galactica and Lights Camera Action! are definite must tries. Make sure to keep yourself hydrated as the temperature can become a tad humid.

review_391937973,“Must visit - All age groups!”,"I have been to Universal Studios twice - With family (Parents) and then with friends (and a 3 year old child). Amazing place - Well thought and built likewise. They have all kind of rides - Simple non scary ones to full on roller coaster rides. If you have a child, I would advise wait and go, when the kid is more than 4 years old. That way, the child can go for rides, accompanying a parent. But for below 2-year-olds, they have these ""Minion"", ""Hollywood"", ""Shrek"" shows and all. - Plan your trip - It becomes highly crowded on weekends and public holidays. The wait time for that lines can go upto 120 Mins for major rides. - Buy the express ticket if you have the energy to cover the entire lot. The wait time will go up to 5 mins at the most (Recommended as the normal line is somewhere close to 50 to 120 mins) Do not buy express ticket for ppl who dont have plans to go for all rides. It will be a waste of money. - Restaurants at all zones, Snack counters, Clean washrooms, (Cold) Drinking water taps at all the lines, lockers at the rides to keep your stuff in, Prams available for tired toddlers at Far Far Away zone - Five stars for them! - Must go rides - Transformers, Mummy Ride, Shrek 4d, Cyclon roller coaster.

After lining up for two rides, we decided to go back to Guest Services (located near the front entrance when you come in) and paid $140 SGD extra on top of our admission price (we booked thru Klook.com for savings for attrctions- must check!). SO WORTH IT. Hate long lines and longest i waited for a ride was 15 mins (vs. ""50 mins"" but it seemed longer and way more hectic. We bought chicken strips in Jurassic Park which was good but id save your money and get a re-entry stamp and eat at the food court RIGHT next to the place.

review_391694246,“Express Pass is a disgrace”,"There are many positive comments about Universal Studios on Trip Advisor but I want to write my review on the Express Pass. In my opinion, this is a disgrace and the management who thought of this concept should be ashamed of themselves.I overheard one of the employees tell someone interested in the pass that the price of the pass changes daily dependant on the number of people expected. On the website, it states $30 for an express pass (limited) but on Monday 11th July, the price was $50. This ""express pass"" causes the long queues as the staff need to check the express passes to each person and then tick off the rides. The staff then allow approx 6 - 8 express pass people through before allowing the other patrons on. Without these passes, the lines would move far quicker. I'm quite frustrated that many of the trip advisor comments are ""make sure you buy the express pass"". Vote with you feet - stop buying this pass that is purely a money making machine to the management of Universal Studios who clearly have no morals.

You will find rides and shows for every member of your family. No second thought about whether to go or not, just go. Few words of advice 1)Start early so that you get to cover the whole park 2) Get an express pass along with the standard ticket.It is kind of a queue breaker pass and you don't have to wait in the queue for hours. In bad day you may have to wt. for hours to get in transformer ride. It may cost few extra bucks, but its worth it. 3)Avoid weekend or Singapore public holiday, it is overcrowded at that time and if you are without an express pass.Enjoy this place like one of a life time.

It is an additional $70 SGD on top of the ticket price (therefore it was $288 for 2 adults with the express option) but so worth it! There were lines that were 80 minutes long with the ordinary ticket, however with the Studio Express ticket the lines to these rides may have been 5 or 10 minutes. We went on rides 2 to 3 times when others with the ordinary tickets were still lining up for 1 ride. The food is very average, but you don't really go to these places for the food.

However one day is not enough for all the activities in Universal Studio, unless you have the Express pass ( price not known).The studio contains many themed zone like Hollywood, New York, Sci-Fi city, Egypt, Jurassic Park, Madagascar. Each zone contains different activities.Lots of activities like transformer autobots ride, roller coaster, revenge of mummy, jurassic park, shrek 4d show, lights,camera, action in hollywood section and many more. For every activity, enormous queues are there, especially in transformers, roller coaster and jurassic park rapids adventure, Canopy Flyer. There is a waterworld show you must see which is a live action performance that involves stunts on a stage that is set within a large pool of water.Get the guiding map and show timing leaflet at the entrance and plan accordingly, else you may miss some activity. Get a Express pass to avoid the queues. The entry ticket is SGD 74, but you may check some online stores like klook.com to get the tickets cheaper. Food is not allowed to be taken inside the studio, owever you can take small biscuit packets and small water bottles. There are many food points but are too costly. Also not much options for vegans. Drinking water fountains are installed in almost each zones.Overall its a great experience.

Shortest queues are half hour and this is on a Tuesday non school holiday period. A half hr wait time really means you are waiting minimum 40 minutes because there is an express line. Waste of money if you don't have an express ticket because you wait in the line for ages and then Anyone walking through the express line just pushes in.. No waiting for them! Plus the heat just makes you exhausted by midday when you might have finally went on 2 rides!!! Hated the experience and would not recommend it for anyone.

review_391274519,“A great day out for young and old!”,"Ok,so it's Universal Studios in Singapore. So firstly, it's gonna cost you to get in the gate. Add the express pass onto your ticket price because who wants to stand in line all day for rides? So it's worth it in that regard. But it doubles the ticket price for adults and more than doubles it for the kids. Make sure you understand that it doesn't cover ALL rides so there are a few that you can't skip the queue. Luckily it's not the major rides, but still annoying given that you have paid above and beyond so you don't have to wait in line. So if you can get over that (S$536 for a family of 4 to walk through the front gates) - then you're gonna have a great day! It lives up to it's name - the kids and adults alike loved it. The rides are great - Transformers is a MUST DO..! As is the Galactica & the Typhoon.... the little kids are well looked after with rides as well - these are also fun for the adults. Lots of food options so look around, download the park map before you go to plan your day.

review_391251808,"“Crowded, Long wait in queues”","We visited Universal Studios mid-week in early July 2016. We arrived at 9:25 am and queued up to purchase entry tickets for the 10:00 am opening. The tickets are priced at S$74 adult, S$56 (child 2-12 years) and S$36 senior (60 years plus). We were able to get a discount of 10% on tickets as we had The Map of Singapore which has an advertisement for 10% off to Universal Studios for holders of foreign passports. We had the opportunity to purchase express tickets at an additional cost of S$60 per ticket – but declined. We had arrived early and thought that we could manage to get round most of the rides before the crowds arrived later. We were quite mistaken! The actual gates to the park opened at 9:50 am and we were one of the first in and raced off to the Transformers ride. We were told that the wait would only be twenty minutes. No way – it was actually 55 minutes long in the queue with others and the ride only lasted a few minutes. It was then off to Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure which is a ride on a doughnut shape across water where you may get wet or splashed and see a few dinosaurs. Again, long queues and waiting times. The express ticket holders queue still requires a wait, but probably half the time. There are lots of crowds about and it is fairly easy to lose someone. Food and drink stalls are over-priced and only take cash – Not Visa or American Express credit cards. There is a bag check at the front entrance gate to Universal Studios and you are not allowed to bring in any food or drink. It was a very hot day and it was also difficult to find places to actually sit down. There are drinking water fountains about and we used this to fill up our own water bottles. We were at Universal Studios until late afternoon.

review_391195266,“Always a great day out”,"Overall this is a good theme park. It has a good mix of rides for all ages, and a couple of white knuckle rides to keep the enthusiasts happy. I would say that this is a must visit on the Singapore tourist trail. Couple of tips. First is to get there early. If you get there at 10 for the opening you usually get a relatively quiet hour before it starts to get busy. Then, take it easy in the middle of the day and pace yourself. Then plan to stay late as the park gets quiet again after about 5pm. The queues for the rides do get quite long. If you can I would really recommend the Express Unlimited pass. Whilst it doubles the cost of admission it can be really worth it. The cost per ride will end up being less than not buying it. For example. The queue for the Jurassic Park ride was 45 minutes. But only 5 minutes in the Express queue. That is some saving!

review_391045676,“Top 5 tips and tricks. ”,"1. Use an universal express pass It's really usefull because you dont have to wait 1-2 hours to play an attraction. But it might became more expensive because you have to pay 60 dollars more. But trust me its worth to use.2. Single ride is very useful  If you dont want spent more money to buy an express pass. Well, you should try to play an attraction by yourself or single ride. Because its very helpful and you just have to wait 30-45 minutes. But it's also depends what kind of game do you play. 3. Earlier easier  If you come sooner you might can play attraction without waiting. And the first thing you should do is play the transformers ride and battlestar cyclone (because it'll very crowded and you could wait for 2-3 hours)4. Bring an empty bottle and a pair of clothes Trust me in singapore especially inside the studio everything's expensive. That's why an empty bottle will very helpful because you can refill it. And some attractions could wet your clothes. And to dryed it you have to pay.5. Jurassic Park First: you shouldnt play this attraction at the first time because you""ll get wet and its kinda suck. Second: Or you could bring a raincoatThird: Play this attraction when it's nearly closed.

review_390998340,“Adults can enjoy.”,"Rides like transformers, mummy, lost world, madagascar are really nice. Our kid (3.5 yrs old) liked the madagascar and few movie shows. Not suitable for senior citizens..A full day is worth spending there. Due to heavy rush in these rides, suggested to buy express ticket.

review_390886889,“Different feel in the evening ”,"We usually visit USS during day time but since we have the half yearly passes, we decided to visit the place in the evening this time round so that we could catch the fireworks at night too. It was cooling in the evening and the place was brightly lit up. We managed to watch the last waterworld show again and it was simply awesome! We could watch it over and over again. The fireworks were breathtaking too and I'm glad we made the right choice to wait for the 930pm show. Do find a good spot to view the fireworks early as it can get crowded as the time draws near.For families with children, it's advisable to buy half-yearly or annual passes so that you can enter USS for unlimited time during that period. We always catch different shows and do different rides for every visit there. All in all, it's happy place for kids and those young at heart!

review_390880673,“Been to one theme park then this is the same!”,"If this is your first theme park then spend the extra $50 for express passes. As I had been to quite a number of other similar parks I wasn't overly impressed as it held nothing too special for me. The line-ups went from instant to 90 minutes... and it was HOT and Stuffy. Special tip: if travelling with teens and friends... skip the huge lines at Jurassic raft ride and go onto the line up for Singles.. very little wait as they use these peeps as fill-ins on the rafts!

review_390858987,“Good Theme Park Experience”,"We went mid-week and arrived early (10am). We got on all the big rides in the first hour with ease (small queues) but then it started to get busy so we switched to using the single-rider queues (much faster).We enjoyed the Mummy and Transformers and also the Waterworld show. However, overall the park felt a bit limited. We visited the Gold Coast in Australia a few years back and it had much better attractions.

review_390693403,“HUGE waste of time and money- do something else”,"Queues for rides up to 180 minutes?!?! They must over-pack the venue as when we went there the average wait time for most of the rides was between 60-120 minutes and at some points was as much as 180 minutes- who wants to line up for 3 hours for a 5 minute ride? I've never seen it so ridiculous at any other amusement park in the world.Sure, you can buy an express ticket on top of the S$75 entry fee for ANOTHER S$100 extra!!Such a rip off. After we'd spent $260 getting in and only managed to go on/see about 5 things we left annoyed and feeling ripped off. Don't waste your time or money.

review_390684304,“VIP Tour ”,"Although expensive, when visiting for one day only with our teenage children and not knowing if we would return to Singapore again, this is probably the best option, the VIP Tour. You are personally escorted. Olif, our guide, greeted us in the VIP Reception Lounge with cold drinks and snacks, explained to us what was available and asked us what we would like to see and do. We were issued with VIP lanyards and wrist bands, which all staff recognised.This guarantees no waiting, choice of seats on all rides, seat preference for the Shrek 4D Show and an air-conditioned box for the Water World Show. Also included is a $25 food voucher for each person and discounts at various merchandise shops.Olif's advice and knowledge informing us on which rides we might get wet and offering ponchos, security for our personal possessions while we were on rides, arranging private photo sessions with Universal Studio movie characters and even booking a restaurant so we wouldn't have to wait for a table is all part of the VIP service. We saw everything and did everything which you would never achieve in one day, without a VIP Tour.Olif ensured our one day as a VIP at Universal Studios Singapore was justified and great.

We spent an extra $50 each on express passes and it was absolutely worth it - no queues for us when the main queues were 30-90 mins.... in the heat!!!! Definitely recommend if you can afford it. As a result we completed everything we wanted to in the 9 hours we were there. Highlights included shrek 4d, transformer ride, Elmo show, donkey show, and the Madagascar ride.

However, when we walked past hundreds of people on every ride straight to the front cutting out 80 minute queues then it was worth every cent!! There are a great selection of rides here and the battle star galactica rivals uk rides like nemesis etc. The mummy is also fantastic but one of my favourite had to be the 4d transformers ride.

We paid our $80 plus for a ticket and expected that should get us in rides. But those with express passes (another $80) kept bumping us all off. So in essence, the price of a ticket is $160 if you want to get a ride. Food appalling, expensive, and place way too crowded. So glad to get out of there. Universal studios, you should be ashamed!

review_390092239,“~S$440 for less than 2 minutes of rides”,"We are a family of 5 with 3 children aged 5, 6 and 8. We had promised our children a visit to Universal Studios in lieu of other Christmas presents. Although I did not think I would get great enjoyment from the trip I had expected the kids would enjoy the day based on previous theme park trips, particularly our eldest (girl) and youngest (boy).This was the grand finale to a wonderful four week holiday.We deliberately chose a non holiday time in the hope of reduced queues.We caught a taxi to Vivo S$10 and got the monorail S$20 across (the taxi driver prophetically warned us and said we should go to the zoo instead.... but we had booked the tickets online S$316 and went ahead). We survived the lengthy queues and pushy people to get to Sentosa via the monorail. The queue to enter Universal Studios was mercifully short.We walked past what seemed to be an endless number of horrifically priced food stands (eg S$11 'hot dog') and crass merchandise stalls before deciding to go on the junior roller coaster (Enchanted Airways) ... estimated wait 20 minutes. More than an hour and twenty minutes later we did the approx 20 second roller coaster ride.Having seen the queue length my wife and I decided we should get 2x limited express pass (1 express ride on most attractions) for another S$120 so we could get one ride on each.We thought we would try one more ride before using the passes. The Lost World ride estimated wait ... you guessed it 20 minutes. Over an hour later and still at least a half hour until the end of the queue (the express queue was an 80 minute estimated!! wait by this stage) we abandoned the queue.In desperation to get our daughter a ride on something she might enjoy we looked at many other rides. The main ride, the Cyclon, was a 145 minute estimated!! wait (normal queue). Most others were at least 80 minute estimated wait time. Judging by the queues and our previous experience the express lane would have been that long and the normal queues several times that.At that point we gave up all hope.I sold the express passes because no refund was available despite them being unused for S$40 to some young Jordanian guys who were quoted S$70 each ... I know because I was standing in the queue behind them (how the price had increased S$10 in the 3.5 hours we had been there wasn't clear).We left around 2pm having waited almost 4 hours in queues for a combined total of less than 2 minutes of rides and spent nearly S$400 including the S$40 we sold the passes for.Worse than the wasted day and the considerable cost was the extremely disappointed daughter in tears and two very agitated boys.In the wise words of the taxi driver we should have gone to the zoo. This was, without doubt, one of the most offensive experiences I can recall. As a forgiving and pretty relaxed soul I could have laughed it off as a never to be repeated disaster save for the devastated look on my daughter's face when she admitted (against every instinct) that she saw no point in staying.I could add many more paragraphs about how tired and poorly maintained the facility appeared to be but in the scheme of things these are minor criticisms.I had a mind to take a photo of me burning some notes having more fun at considerably less cost than our family did at Universal Studios.Do yourself a favour and avoid.

However it is as clean as its counterpart in the L.A. Loved the fact that they have the smoked turkey legs which i loved in L.A. which they used to call alien legs. I would have give the attraction a 5 star if i was not to compare it to Universal L.A. on its own however its a 5 or even 10 all day long.

review_389950408,“Fun for the whole family where you can spend the entire day”,"We visited Universal on a Saturday in November. We pre booked out tickets online and pickup on the day. Once ticket was pickup at the counter there was a line to get into the theme park. It moved reasonable fast. We entered the park at opening time at 10am. Would advise to do most of the rides first thing within the first two hours as the lines to the rides weren't very long and some of them had no lines. During the afternoon some of the rides lines would be up to 1 to 2 hours. Most of the rides would have 3 separate lines. Most of the Roller Coaster rides are in the Sci-Fi City themed area. One for Single riders, one for couples/group and one for the Express pass holders. Found the line for Single riders to be a lot faster than the couple or group riders. If you’re not into the Roller Coaster rides then I would recommend the following shows that is fit for the entire family which includes WaterWorld, Shrek 4-D Adventure and Lights, Camera, Action! Obviously more people would visit on the weekend so would be best to visit during a weekday. Convenient located and easy to get to on public transport. Use the MRT to Harbour Front MRT station then change to a tram service to Universal Studios. Spent a whole day at the park and had a wonderful time.

review_389755924,“Nice Park... do plan ahead”,"We visited on a Saturday right after the school holidays ended and it was actually less crowded than we feared. Went there early and had breakfast at the food court outside the park. By the time we finished and get to the entrance at about 9.30am, the queue to enter has already started. At about 9.45am, they opened the gates and we headed straight for Transformers. Went straight through. Then next to Jurassic Park Rapids but found that they only open at 11am. So we went on to Shrek 4D and Madagascar crate ride. No queues so far. By the time we got back to Jurassic Park just after 11, we had to line up for about 30 mins - this was the longest wait we had for our visit, so I didn't think it was very bad. We went for the Sesame St show at 12 noon but did not find it very interesting - maybe good for younger kids, otherwise can skip that. Then we break for lunch and saw Water World after that. The green zone seats are ok - you may just get a sprinkling of water or your shoes wet.It was not an extremely hot day but very very humid so good to bring a fan along. Also felt that they should build sheltered walkways leading to the Water World because it was really exposed area. Luckily we didn't have to queue. We left at about 2pm to go home to rest, have dinner and returned to the park in the early evening for more rides and to see the fireworks. We did not stay for the 3pm parade because we were tired and it would be extremely hot to stay out in the open. When we returned in the evening, there was virtually no queue at any of the rides and we could repeat some of the rides that we wanted to do again. The fireworks display was ok, not great, lasted only 5 minutes and there was too much smoke obsuring the view.We felt that express pass is not required if you are able to visit just before opening and to return near closing and planned exactly what rides you want to do. The park is small so most of the time goes into waiting in lines. If there were no lines like in the evening, you could actually do many rides in 1 hour.

The crew which are in charge of seating the guests seem to be a bit lost, it takes a lot of time for them to load up each ride, therefore the waiting Times have significantly increased. The food prices are too high for the average, theme park quality. I suggest eating at the Mel's Drive In located in the New York City area, it's probably the best food in the park. As for the attractions, I really enjoy the Revenge of The Mummy (there's a nice single riders queue so you don't have to wait a lot) and Battlestar Galactica, of course ;)

review_389643884,"“""Fun Family Getaway""”","And so we had this little family trip to Singapore for a short sightseeing. We had options of going to the zoo, to the gardens or to universal studios. With my children 4 and 6 years old theres nothing more exciting than going to a theme park full of rides. So there we went ready for a day of family adventure. Since it was unplaned, we end up queing to get tickets. Tip, if u want it cheaper book ahead online. Rather than that it was a smooth ride going to the island via express monorail. Arrived there and started feeling the heat, people, but most of all the ambience of fun. There were performances on many corners. So many rides u not sure which one to start. Surprisingly, its only about 3 rides the children cant go because of height restriction, apart from that u can do it all. Most queus are long wait, u can either stay in line or come back later which we did for few rides and luckily it was way quicker and less wait for the second try. U can also get the quickest option to pay express pass for $50 /each if u want to go straight and no wait. Best rides not to miss i highly recommmend the transformers ride, shrek 4d and puss in boots giant journey! Kids definitely loved it and so as me and hubby. This is a good fun happy place to bring the kids along. Sunnies, hats and sunscreen is a must and most importantly bring along lots and lots of water, if not theres many stalls that sells water and other drinks for about $4-6. For families who wants a family fun weekend specially with young kids who likes rides and adventure, i highly recommend this place.

We were ready for this, and made sure we arrived around 40 minutes before the gates opened, so at least some of the queues had shorter wait times. The rides are all great, and we could not complain about anything, but for the budget conscious, bring your own food as the food is very expensive. An empty water bottle can also be filled from drinking taps around the park. Our family of 4 (kids 14 and 12) easily spent the whole day there, but we didn't pay extra for 'skip the queue' passes. However because this option is available, it slows the process down as these people tend to get ride priority - it is something worth considering. All in all however, a great day out.

review_389335597,“Hit or miss”,"Pros: transformers, the mummy, battlestar galactica, single rider lines.Cons: pushy people and loud children, poor queuing systems, terrible food, small parkThroughout my visit I went back and forth between whether I would rate this place a 2,3 or 4. It started as a 3 when I noted the smallness of it and the fact that the Jurassic park section inexplicably opened later than the rest. I was also irritated by the lack of order and regulation at the entry gates and the fact that many rides require you to use a locker.It dropped to a 2 when we waited forever through the multi-part, multi-line shrek show (full of impatient people and little order to the queue), followed by a similar experience at the underwhelming Madagascar ride (people shoving is the whole time). To top it off this was followed by eating at a terrible restaurant (oasis spice cafe) when our restaurant of choice (casa del wild) was inexplicably closed.But the overall experience improved once we managed a few well-timed single rider lines. We used the single rider line on transformers twice (making a 100 minute wait into 15 minutes the first time), on the Jurassic park canopy, puss n boots, and battlestar galactica: human. We also had great luck with short regular lines on the mummy, which we rode twice. The waterworld show was fantastic. It was also easy to get into and (thankfully) well-managed in audience flow (a rarity).Overall the general experience of the park could be improved immensely with better line management and a vast increases in food quality. Oasis spice cafe was almost inedible, yet still expensive. Jurassic park opening at 11 instead of 10 meant yet another crazy/frustrating mad dash of pushy people. (And on top of that the main attraction of the rapids ride was underwhelming after all of the hassle). Improving the lines would also include alternatives to the strict ""lockers only"" policy for personal possessions on certain rides. This was most irritating on battlestar galactica, where even wallets are banned (my husband got turned away from the line twice!). For the price, you can enjoy some very fun rides (transformers is the most awe-inspiring), which makes it worthwhile. Just make sure you go in with a plan and do as many single rider lines as you can.

review_389313478,“Good!”,"The rides are somewhat different than those in Hollywood; except with the Transformers. Anyways, this is a good place to go to especially if you like adventurous rides. Their rides are much more on the roller coaster side than those with visuals/ special effects. But... We had fun especially there's only a few people who were in the park when we got there; so we didn't really wait in line too long.

review_389279836,“Not comparable to LA universal studio ”,"If you look for 4D ride likes transformer , here only one to two. If you have been LA one and look for 4D rides , you can skip this one. Rides here are more like Disneyland. the park is small but fairly speaking , atmosphere is ok, parade is also good. Depends on what you are looking for. We had fast past so skip the queue. I can understand why ppl complained after 30 mins to 45 mins waiting time and one min ride. Some rides you think it is ok to wait for an hour , it's worth. the ride here may not worth waiting for an hour. If you have no fast pass. Go there early or near evening, can save some waiting time. If you are family with kids , it is ok to have s taste of universal studio.

On a very sultry day, standing in lines for 30-45 was not very happening. But in my group lot of first timers did have fun. The highlight was the Water show done by Australian Acrobats, - Precission, Pyro-technic, fast and pretty furious, and in the first rows quite a wet affair.. Roller Coasters were the best attraction, though I did not ride. The ones who did had a whale of a time.

review_389262999,“Great rides but long lines”,"Universal Studios Singapore was great for both adults and kids. The rides were well designed and the kids loved them. We got there early and rushed to the most popular rides. We rode on them once before the lines became really long. It was hard lining up in the heat with kids for 1.5 hours or more. What we would have liked to have seen more of the free activities like the parades and characters. They had cancelled some of these the day we were visiting. The food prices were not too bad and there were lots on offer. As a family, we got to go on most rides which was good.

review_388610922,“Comfortable for a One Day Visit”,"Went with my family for my birthday on a hot and humid Saturday in June. Bought the Universal Express Unlimited which was a waste, should have bought the Universal Express only as we never really had time to go for a 2nd ride on any of the attractions. Try and get there as the park opens as it gets very busy after lunch. The best rides for a 5 year old - Madagascar A Crate Adventure, Puss In Boots Giant Journey, Transformers The Ride, Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure( feet completely underwater) and the show Waterworld was very realistic and action packed. Character Meet and Greets were plentiful - Elsa from Frozen, Minions and others. In the afternoon, it began to rain and they cancelled the parades. make sure you take umbrellas as a standard as it rains almost every afternoon and it is an outdoor attraction with little to very few indoor gathering places. Lots of food and beverage areas. Overall a great experience and can be fully done in 1 day.

review_388355343,“Fun times”,"I visited on the first Saturday of July and hesitated about buying the priority pass. I'm glad I didn't bother as it was not as busy as I thought it would be and the maximum time I waited for a ride was only half an hour. Lucky me. There are plenty of food options and it is not overpriced without being extremely cheap. The best ride for me was the Transformer ride. I also really enjoyed watching the Hollywood parade. I think the trick is to start the day early and be there as soon as the gates open so that you can get onto all your preferred rides while the queues are relatively short. A good day out and no rain. I recommend not getting the priority pass until you have entered the park to check the length of the queues. You can always buy the priority pass once you are inside if you decide the queues are excessively long.

review_388281946,“Fun Day for the Kids”,"While this is not the largest theme park it does have enough to offer to fill a day of fun. Especially if you have children. However unless you're prepared to go on the rides there's not a great deal more to see in the way of shows and attractions. Even at my age I can still enjoy a 4D Shrek movie. I'd have been quite happy if the show had been longer but I know there's a turnaround to consider. The Madagascar ride was fun and would suit all ages. The waterworld show is certainly the most dynamic show its jet skis and pyrotechnics but it fills quickly and if you're last you could end up in the 'going to get soaked' area. The 70 minute wait for the Jurassic water ride was a little too long especially at the thought of knowing that a soaking was more than guaranteed. As with all these theme parks merchandise shops are a plenty and food is the same unless you head out to one of the restaurants. Price was reasonable at $74SGD. On a hot day I can imagine it would become unbearable so make sure you have plenty of water ($6 in the park) and head to a shop for some air-conditioning every so often. Worth a visit.

You can spend the whole day there and might not be able to complete the rides. 2. Remember to deposit your bags using one of those lockers outside USS. some rides cannot afford you to bring your bags up and sway with you. 3. The food inside USS is not cheap neither it is too expensive. Compared to other parts of Sentosa, it is reasonable. BUT: 1. the queue for the rides are way toooooo long. some rides queue time is 60-75 mins. 2. Singapore has only 2 weathers- hot and rainy.

We were recommended by friends to pay the extra money to get an express pass and that made the day for us so much more enjoyable! If you can't afford the extra for the express pass I would recommend getting to the park later in the day about after 2-3 pm as all the kids are tuckered by this time so most families have gone. The wait time for one ride in the morning was 90 minutes by the afternoon it was only 15 minutes. The food is expensive so if you want to save some money take a backpack and pack your own snacks and definitely take some water with you. They do have water fountains so you can keep topped up!

They really need to have places to cool down without going into a ride building or 4D cinema. There should be mist fans and other options around the park for people to cool off. I felt like diving into a shallow pool that was just a feature for one of the rides at one point!

review_387251990,“Staycation fun”,"The rides are there. The weather is fine, the family is fine but the staff working there is not so fine. This is a world class attraction and therefore should have world class entertaining staff. It is an amusement park therefore the staff should have at least a big smile on their faces. The staff factor is so crucial to attract more to visit the park in the ling run so do improve on your hospitality skills of staff. Range of rides is good , catering both to children and adults.I thought more mascots and small performances should be around the park to entertain the park goers. Little performances like street magic or artists etc can be even performing in the restaurants.

Only if you willingly to separate from your group.3. wear thin clothes. The weather is very hot and it's more convenient if you play water rides. So that your clothes dry fast.4. Raincoat for water rides or you can buy from the vending machine there.5. Prayer room near Mummy/ Egypt zone. Behind the locker area.6. Just prepare some cash as you might go hungry after rides.7. Wet tissues for toilet8. Just go and have FUN!!

review_386943568,“Crowded”,"This place is always crowded even on weekday. Try to avoid public holiday and school holiday at all cost or you try on rainy days which many interesting outdoor rides will be closed for safety reason. The rides at Transformer area are the best. The roller coaster in Mummy area isn't suitable for children and seniors. The roller coaster rides are divided into many levels and always attracts a lot of people, so plan to play them as soon as possible. Don't forget to visit Minions shop and bring home some nice gifts.

With 5 young children we wanted to ensure that we were not just having in lines all day and that we could utilise as many rides and attractions as possible. We arrived at 10am and were greeted by Diana, we were taken to all the attractions, and were given priority on all rides or over 6 hours non stop. We thought the express passes were great, but this just took things to another level. We had an amazing day, went on so many rides and saw the park inside out and back to front (literally) Never waited longer than 3 minutes for anything. Brilliant day.

Transformers is always a must ride and just the same as in Florida as is the Mummy Ride which I did alone while my son stayed with his Grandma.

review_386255365,“Busy Park with a lot of hype”,"I like to read about things prior to going, and most reviews including a phone call to Universal Studios prior to going to the Park informed me that not buying the expensive express pass was a good thing. THIS IS WRONG. Buy the express pass or risk waiting 90 minutes for a ride. The park is small compared to others in the world,. and the volume of people is high. Meaning that there are long queues for everything and lots of pushing and shoving as people try to make their way around the park. It is good that it is open until late. I stayed from 10am - 7pm, after 5pm the crowds left and ques no longer became an issue.

review_386248843,“OK first experience but long queue”,"I was there with my 3.5 and 6 years old and my parents (65 and 69 y.o) so we werent too ambitious in trying out all the rides. We got out tickets from klook.com and getting inside was a breeze. It was a thursday on a school holiday. My 3.5 doesnt need a ticket, the minimum age to get a ticket is 4.We got there by taxi at around 10.00 just when it opens. We needed to rent strollers and electric chairs for my parents. The queue was longggg with 1 person handling the payment, getting and preparing for the stuff, AND teaching people how to use them. I spent ard 30-40 minutes just to get mine and i was no 3 in the queue. Later in the day i knew that the electric chairs has ran out.We wanted to try the elmo show but the queue was around 1 hour long, so we skipped and walked further inside. The good thing is all of the rides states the approximate waiting time, so u can decide to go or not.The next one was the battlestar galactica. The queue was said to be around 40 minutes, so we tried the cylon one. While we were queueing, we saw a lot of universal express holders passing us by in the queue. Well maybe that is worth the price you are paying if you intend to try all. Due to the kids and older folks in my group, we were less ambitious :pThe ride was awesome..u will be twist, hung, at a high speed, worth the wait :DThen we had lunch at the food court at the lost world area, there were chicken rice, churros, waffles and meatballs, they were decently priced for a theme park, around sgd 11/12 per course.After lunch, we continue to the lost world and tried some attractions there.Then they were the madagascar spot. We were then less eager to go on anymore rides, mostly due the heat and humidity..We walked slowly out and return the stoller and electric chair and decided to chill for a while on the seats in front of USS. There was a fountain near there, some kids were playing water there.My younger daughter forgot her toy so we went back in..the ticket still valid and the toy was safely kept at lost and found section :)Overall the theme park is rather small but convenient with the needed facility, worth at least 1 visit.

The rollercoasters are nice, but if you take out all the ""only kids"" attractions, only four rides are worth it. Could use a new high thrill rollercoaster. TOO good security on the rides make it not very pratical... have to use a locker at each ride. you cannot have anything in your pockets no matter how secure it is, i understand the coins, phones etc, but a wallet that has no chance of coming out of your pocket might be a little too much. nevertheless recommend the park if you have spare time in singapore and want to enjoy a theme park ambiance.

It was a Thursday not even a weekend we lined up for transformers ride which takes about 6 minutes to complete. So we waited and waited and waited and waited and the transformers line goes from 1 waiting room to the next the que was not even full and we waited 1hour and 35minutes. Oh on a positive note they have 2 free drink fountains in the que which you will need standing there for 1 to 2 hours wasting your day. So we went out and thought lets find another ride with a small que time all ques were 40minutes to 1.5hrs so we had lunch that was extremely over priced and the worst food we had eaten in singapore. After this I just left. I would not recommend this to anyone unless your the type of person that likes to pay $65 for a train ride only to find out the train is 2 hours late and you enjoy waiting at the station that has no beer for you to pass the time with. Then the train finally comes you ride it for 6minutes and they say changing lines and please wait another hour for your next 6minute section repeat this 3 times and your day is over.

review_385136172,“Saddest Universal Studios”,"Service in this amusement park is nothing compared to what you know as the Universal Studios service i.e. where you see staff everywhere. Here there's 1-2 staff per ride (i.e. in the carousel there was 1 staff letting people in, buckling people on the seats, operating the carousel). That's why all the rides take longer than they really should. We went there at lunch time then it started pouring down rain at about 2 p.m. and all the rides were shut. There's not many areas to take cover except for restaurants - so we wasted our entry; no compensation was given (I guess go at your own risk). So look at the weather first when in Singapore (mind you the weather forecast in Singapore was never accurate when we were there).The characters (i.e. like minions and Madagascar) only came out twice a day and interaction with them was very limited (i.e. 10 mins); felt like the kids were being deprived of seeing their cartoon characters.Overall I think it's still something to do. If it wasn't too expensive and had good service then the cost of entry would be worth it.

review_385117751,“Amazing fun for all ages...”,"We went to Universal Studios at Sentosa with our 5yr old daughter. She had a blast, and so did we! It was very well mapped out, with a separate theme for each part of the park. My daughter obviously enjoyed the part with princesses, puss-in-boots and other characters she grew up with rather than transformers etc. We skipped some parts of the park since we were short on time and since we thought she would not understand. I went on some of the scarier rides (like the transformers one) while my daughter loved rides like the Madagascar one and dinosaur park onesOne serious warning: holiday season is definitely not the time to visit! We went during Christmas and we had to wait 2-3 hours for each ride, which was a definite mood-spoiler, which the occasional drizzle making matters worse. It helps if you pay extra and get the priority pass where you can cut queues for certain rides.And pls make sure you go there as early as possible and stay the entire day so that you have ample time to enjoy Universal Studios to the fullest.

review_384907358,“USS will never disappoint”,"Some will say USS is overrated but I would have to disagree. It's a super fun place to spend the day with family or friends! My first visit was in Dec 2012 and my visit for the 2nd time this May 2016 just showed how dedicated the theme park is to providing more entertainment to visitors; in a span of 3+ years, they added a lot of new attractions and gimmicks for all to enjoy.If you're on a budget, you can take the MRT to Harbourfront Station. I'd recommend having an early lunch at Vivo City's food court before heading over to Sentosa Island via the Sentosa Boardwalk (which is for free until Dec 2016 only!). The food inside USS is expensive; you can get a full meal for 6 SGD at the food court whereas that can only get you a sandwich inside USS. I would also highly suggest that you buy tickets online to avoid wasting time lining up at the ticket counters because you are certainly and inevitably going to wait a long time lining up in some attractions, especially the popular ones. Once inside, get a copy of the show schedules for the day (it's located on the stands with the maps) so you can check out which shows you want to see during your stay at USS and you can plan out your day. Rides I would recommend lining up for early:1. Battlestar Galactica Human vs Cylon2. Transformers: The Ride 3. Jurrasic Park Rapids AdventureAs for the rollercoaster rides, if you feel a little less brave, go for the Human first then Cylon. For the transformers ride, it will take you at least an hour (2-3 hours during peak season) to get to the actual ride. Also, if you're going to ride the rapids adventure, you will definitely get wet so bring a dry bag with you or leave it at the lockers (there are lockers you can use for free for 45 minutes at sci-fi city and ancient egypt. Didn't notice any at Jurrasic Park though).Be sure to look around you carefully so you can catch some of the mascots that are roaming around! You can take photos with them for free if you can find them.Lastly, you must definitely check out Waterworld. It's one of the best shows in the theme park and the actors do live stunts during the show. It's awesome! Fair warning: this area has different ""zones"" in the bleachers so if you're willing to sit in the ""Soak"" and ""Splash"" zones, bring some extra clothes because during the pre-show, the actors play around with the audience and purposely soak people near the set.USS closes at 6pm or 9pm. It depends. If you go there on a weekend, you get to see their parade.

In my opinion, the variety here isn't a wow BUT however you'll be wanting MORE go's after your first try! In the recent years, the park has been popular with the local teens, like myself, and I have had the experience of both a Standard and an Express. Regardless if you're visiting as a solo or as a family, I would highly recommend you to get the Express Ticket and to avoid the Standard Ticket. You'll have the privilege of priority queues which should not be more than 5-7 minutes whereas the Standard Ticket could take you through 45 to 120 minutes (yes, 2 crazy hours!) of waiting. Or 30 minutes, that is if you're lucky! This is purely my observation after visiting Universal regularly for the past 6 months. Though there's a state of ""Peak Season"" or ""Holiday Season"", I think every single day is a Peak Season. It seems like there's no day or month where the park is low in visitors! Well, this shows how awesome USS is. So for a more maximal and time-efficient experience, grab an Express Ticket! You certainly won't regret! Oh, and be sure to watch out for afternoons @ 2-4pm because that's when crowds start to congregate. I'm sure by 6 it'll be dispersed by 50% so with a Standard Ticket, you can probably enjoy shorter-than-usual queues till 8 when the Park closes. Though, check online for the operating hours as it may vary.Some rides that brought me back many great memories are the BattleStar Galactica, the Mummy and the Transformers! Side note: I'm someone who used to have a phobia of rollercoasters. I brought a friend along to help me overcome my fear by going through a 10-in-row Mummy ""Therapy"". Of course, we did beat the long queues with our Express Passes!

review_384756866,“Awesome place ”,"Very nice place to be ... Stay in any of the universal studio hotels as u can take maximum benefit of the same. Also the rooms are not very large but then the location is very good. For Indians pack dry food as much as u want as this place offers no veg items. The hotels and cafes have nothing called veg. So plan accordingly... U get good deals on the tickets , Enquiry and then buy...

review_384584470,“Thrill at its best.....Must to go.....”,"Now First thing.....i heard soo many reviews about this almost all were good and informative.... and you may see all write about Express pass other wise you will waste so much time there...its right....but i am amazed that no body wrote about SINGLE RIDER SYSTEM.... in USS almost all rides have three types of entry... 1.attractions entrance meant general ticket holder.....2. Universal express means express pass holder which comes with extra cost..and the last one is.......3. Single rider enrty.... in my case this single rider system failed the express line..amazed na????? I was also......now what is this... actually by this line you can go directly to the ride... and they will take one person from this line to every ride.... and i think people are not aware of this... i waited for almost 90 minutes in Blaister galatica.... and straight went to Transform ride and saws this enrty and took the chance that what is this i went in and you know what i took the ride in one minute while the waiting time was 55 minute... the same happend in jurasic park ride i took the ride through this enty in less then 30 second the time i took to walk at the ride gate..... me and my wife was done with almost all rides in less then 2 hours....where the Express line holders were still in line.... but yes one thing to Mention here... as they alow only one person in each ride at once so i did not sit with my wife in rides... she went before me or i went before her....people may say we want to enjoy with family not alone.... thats right.. but you kw what when you are in ride you only enjoy with you... you are totally lost in such amazing rides..... almost all major rides are enjoyed alone... not with anyone one else.... and after enjoying rides yoy have enough time to share your experience with yoyr love ones.... if you wanna save money and time then its awesome way to enjoy.... rest this place is amazing....TRANSFORMERS RIDE IS THE MOST AMZING EXPERIENCE.... IT CANT BE EXPLAINED IN WORDS.... CAN ONLY BE FELT.

review_384483634,“A fun theme park experience in Singapore”,"Despite living in the US, I had never visited a Universal Studios theme park before, so Universal Singapore was my first experience and cannot be compared with Orlando or LA. With that being said, I had a thrilling time here. there are 7 sections of the park. There are enough attractions to keep a visitor busy most of the day. Lines for rides aren't too terribly long (apart from Battlestar Galactica: Cylon), and if you're a single rider, most rides are simply a 5-10 minute wait away. Food and souvenirs are overpriced, but entry tickets (at $74 Singapore dollars) aren't, in my opinion. There is a good mix of thrill rides with slower rides and water rides. I enjoyed my time here and would probably return if ever in the Singapore area again.

review_384478646,“Do's and Don't in USS”,"Harsh(another reviewer) has covered mostly everything in his review of USS.I am adding my experience to it, For the rides follow the order posted by Harsh ,however make sure u complete the Battlestar Galactica (Cyclon or Human) well on time.I had planned to do it in the end the weather changed towards late afternoon(long story cut shot) i had to wait till the ride re opened,did finished the 2 though.Do not eat heavy breakfast on the day...specially if u wish to take the Roller coaster in the beginning,you don't wana let the world know what was your breakfast;)Not Just USS the entire SG is an Oyster for Non vegetarians therefore hubs enjoyed his meals and i struggled for food.As regards the Express entry is concerned:I learned the Hard way,irrespective of what day it is,please buy the express entry(specially if you have kids)..we queued for almost 45 mins for every ride. Look at the crowd while entering USS and decide for yourself.In SG veg is egg or Mushrooms,I am not fond of either of them hence the struggle.Vegetarians--Do Pack nibbles for yourself or you survive on Slush/Coke(btw i only survived on Slush) etc.After every ride you come out to the merchandise store(Madagascar,Shrek etc).These are pretty expensive.I had been there on a Tuesday and have covered The Spielberg Show,Shrek Movie and the Soak Party(@3pm).Connectivity is a Boon in SG,Just follow the Instructions in USS(ViVO City/Beach) and you can travel cheap and quick. I had an misconception that we might have to walk far from Vivo city to catch MRT to Clarke Quay(my station).This isn't the case,within the mall is where MRT is..THUMB RULE is to follow instructions anywhere and everywhere.

With the ride going at 90km/hr, the rain was less of a worry than the ride slide down from high point (a few times). The transformer rides was much better. It is good to have a express pass, otherwise you will be spending more time on the queue than trying to enjoy the various rides.

You'll get better vision! Mummy ride, where ever you seat it still thrilling, and trust me, it will suprise you!

review_384008064,“Quite good but not that big!”,"To get here, take the MRT subway to Harbourfront Station and enter Vivo City mall. Take the escalators up to the very top level of Vivo City mall and you can either buy your tickets here (about 20 minutes in line) or from the ticket booth near Universal Studios. (Cost around $74.00 AUD). You can walk across the bridge from Vivo City to Universal Studios or take the Sentosa Express (monorail, $4.00 AUD for a return ticket). The wait for the monorail is about 15 minutes in the morning and about 30 minutes of an evening. Universal Studios Singapore still costs around the same as Universal Studios Japan but it seems like it's only about half as big. This could partially be because they don't have a Wizarding World of Harry Potter like they do in Japan. I'd say you could easily see everything here in about 7 hours, whereas Japan would take you about 14 hours. The Battlestar Galactica Rollercoaster is very good (especially the blue Cylon coaster) but I'd say the rest of the attractions range between average to above average). Most rides also have a ""single rider"" queue which will get you on the ride much faster than the normal line.

You can possibly experience and feel here all the feelings in just a day that should be experienced in a long period of time. Nervousness, Excitement, Happiness, Sadness, name it and you can probably feel all. Even though, almost all the rides has long lines, once you get in there you will realized that falling in line for like at least 30 minutes.My favorite ride was probably the transformers ride, it was so intense and so reality-like. We waited for like more or less 30 mins but staying in line was not really that boring because of the interior of the ride. So many interesting thing and you can really see that there are a lot of Filipinos living and visiting Singapore. The staffs are also very accommodating and the foods in there were really good. Especially that one stall that's selling corn dog and mash potato.I recommend you guys to go visit this place. I swear it is worth the money, time and effort

review_383847022,“Great experience! ”,"We went on a Friday reached around 10 and decided to head to transformer ride... It was a painfully long waiting time more than 1 hour- with kids and elders it was difficult. Saw few people exiting after waiting for more than half an hour. But the later part of the day was good and easy with lesser waiting time.Shrek 4D was fun kids and adults enjoyed alike. Mummy ride was fun- kids waited with grandparents till we finished the ride. Meeting and clicking pics with Pinocchio was fun! Madagascar is a good theme area for kids- the boat ride, merry-go-round was good but nothing interesting for adults. Steven Spielberg s 'light camera action' was good but too short and you are left wanting to see more... Didn't get much time in the lost world... All in all a good experience, a nice place, with drinking water available every where- even in the waiting queues, clean washrooms. Negatives -1. a little heavy on the pocket 2.Rides don't have variety - mostly Rollercoaster 3. Waiting queues of more than half an hour for a 5-7 minutes ride dampens the experience 4. As much the kids might want to buy a souvenir from the shops they are all overpriced, you ll get Shrek at almost half the price at hamleys. 5.Prefer going in the middle of the week weekends are not worth it!

Had to wait for 1 hour for Transformer ride which was painful with 2 small kids and elders in group, but the ride was excellent. Found long waiting in Dinosoaring ride also which is for small kids only. We found thinner crowd post lunch and could do Far-away and Madagascar rides with 5 mins waiting. 4D Shrek show is excellent one. Light, Camera Action by Spielberg was interesting but not a great one. Street shows are good.Food options limited for vegetarians. All rides - Mummy, Gallactica, Puss in boots, etc - are variants of roller coaster only. With the price of ticket paid for adults, there should be other ride variants. Express Pass isn't worth for family with kids as beyond a point one gets bored with roller coaster rides only and won't do all rides.

And no trip to SG is complete without a visit to Sentosa and Universal Studios Singapore. USS is a delight for the family. Despite its smaller size compared to the original version in Hollywood and to other theme parks, the list of attractions of USS does not pale in comparison. We were there in mid June and surprisingly there was no big crowd inside the resort which usually causes long queues. Probably due to our weekday visit. In 6 hours, we managed to enjoy 7 attractions and have lunch without the stressful throng of visitors. The following attractions were indeed enjoyable: Steven Spielberg's Lights Camera Action, Madagascar boat ride, Enchanted airways, Shrek 4D, Transformers - The ultimate 3D battle, Canopy flyer and Revenge of the Mummy. Blast from the past was provided by Sesame Street - complete cast of characters. Very enjoyable trip, and it deserves a next visit.

review_382695338,“Enjoyed the day”,"We visited Iniversal Studios as I am a keen thrill ride seeker and enjoyed the many rides on offer. My wife even surprised me by coming on a few with me. The park is well laid out and themed. Whilst it was a hot day there were many fans in queue lines and eating areas to overcome the heat. Staff and facilities were of a high standard. Take the opportunity and visit.

review_382638730,“樂不思蜀”,"坦白說，這次到新加坡的目的就是要去環球影城。為什麼？就是因為可以親親迷你兵（小小兵）！你可以能說日本也有影城，但因為我比較喜歡語言相通的地方，而且新加坡不斷在超越香港，所以有一點情義結下選定了這一個地方。因為通過新航假期訂了獅城全景通一日遊（24小時），成人門票已經包括在全景通內，沒有額外付款入場。旅遊景點一向都是人多，特別是假日，所以我們選擇在星期四進場。果然人流沒有假日那麼多，但仍是有很多人，也見到印度國藉遊客一家大細，一行最少六人來遊玩，家庭樂實在是一種福氣。用全景通的可以到遊客服務站換領門票，不用在售票亭換票，節省很多時間。之後，我們就進場了。我們走在最左邊接近全年通行證的入口排隊，由於保安理由，所有遊客都要檢查所帶來的背包。香港的兩大樂園都是慣例，沒意外，也會乖乖排隊等安檢。後來，職員看見人流多了，就馬上開放全年通入口，疏導人流，非常欣賞。我們前面的是印藉遊客，差不多到安檢位置，但職員就示意叫我們從全年通入場，也沒有檢查我的只有三份之一的小手袋，就看看丈夫的背包就給我們走了。很奇怪，心裡有很多疑問。我們真的很像新加坡本地人嗎？進場到荷李活區已經被迷你兵商店、裝飾所吸引，難捨難離...我們沒有甚麼遊玩的策略，就是每個都玩就可以，也記住迷你兵出場拍照的時間即可。於是，我們向左開始玩，先與荒失失奇兵拍下第一場兩人照，接著玩它的小舟。本以後是室內有空調，但進場後不是太冷吧！還可以。看見熟悉的卡通人物有不同的造型，多搞笑！之後，我們就走到Far Far Away山卡拉國的史力加主題區玩4D影院。從荒失失奇兵區走到史力加區都不過一分鐘，節省很多腳骨力！讚！室內的空調太讚了！進場前別忘記自己領取3D眼鏡。沒有膽量玩倒轉整個人的過山車，可以玩Puss in Boots Giant Journey貓貓小型過山車。都有一點速度的～緊記要把小型物品放在自己的背包中，為安全起見，不要自拍了！離開之後，過了一分鐘便到了侏羅紀公園。我們只是玩了Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure（激流）和欣賞Live Show The Lost World。這天就只有這一個設施排了45分鐘，其餘都不用花時排隊。這個激流真是一試難忙！建議大家穿涼鞋或防水鞋，即使上身不濕，浪花都會沖入座位腳步，我們的鞋就此全濕。可能是幸運，上身沒有濕。但是，看見對面的印藉遊客（真的很多）因浪花濕了一次（大濕），不久浪花再向她沖，最後浪花目標都是她，連中三元，本來與不同國藉遊客都是暗笑，最後都忍不住大笑起來。木伐要坐升降機！太刺激啦！所以，排45分鐘都是值得，而且現在可以上網，時間很快過....如果大家怕背包弄濕，激流附近就有一個45分鐘免費locker，讚！帶著不斷的笑聲和沈重的腳步（全濕）到最接近的洗手間，馬上清潔腿步。烈日當空，而且鞋子濕透了，就在一個不太顯眼和不會阻礙其他遊客的地方曬鞋。正好在清潔的時候可以等待The Lost World Live Show，沒安排反而比有安排更好。The Lost World Live Show開場前的氣氛真是很好！在座位上已經註明必濕身區（全濕）、部份濕身區和不會濕身區，大家按自己的勇氣選位吧～節目真是很精彩！我們帶了行山小背包，在水袋中裝了2.2公升清水，不到一個早上就喝清了！到新加坡真的要多喝清水，在戶外排汗量很厲害。但整體來說比濕熱的香港舒服得多。就是正午的時候，最好就是跑到室內。我們回到Far Far Away與Donkey驢仔對話。太搞笑啦！這次進場人數特別多，Donkey不客氣的問拍當為什麼這麼多人。他一語導出主因.......因為這裡有免費空調!!!!!!哈哈哈!!!!!只要大家投入，氣氛真不錯！樂在其中！終於可以跟迷你兵合照啦！太感動！！！！！不過Bob的腳太長了！見到有少女打扮成迷你兵，作為粉絲真係自愧不如呢！在紐約區還有Elmo與朋友，也有一個適合小朋友的Live Show劇場。對於我們作為職青的，覺得比較悶，而且曬了一整天，有舒適的座位和空調不由自主的打盹了。但到了未段是可以與Elmo擊掌的！同區的Sesame Street Stage Shows就可算是巡遊吧！畢竟影城面積還比香港迪士尼細小，明白的！接受的！Light, Camera Action, Hosted by Steven Spielberg的正門不顯眼，但大人切勿錯過，可以親身感受拍電影的實境！太震撼了！也在此呼籲我們每一位都應該尊重影視人員的辛勞，支持正版及創作！離開後走了不過一分鐘通過Sci-Fi City就進入埃及區Ancient Egypt。很壯觀！Revenge Of the Mummy是一個不會倒轉身的過山車，但進場前一定要把所有隨身物品儲在locker或由親友保管。Locker首45分鐘也是免費的。未進場時看見這個過山車的設計與佈置，「心血小一點都想縮沙」。真是有點怕，但女生就是這樣，有男生相陪都要跟著去。當然，如果大家真的覺得不舒服就不要去，只是會錯過這個很好玩的設施。由於人流太少，基乎可以說不用排隊，真想再玩一次！膽量小的我說的是真的！只是在門口走到上車的路實在太遠了才放棄玩第二次。過山車不是人人都可以玩，但這裡就有一個家庭室供遊客等待要刺激一番的親友，讚！回到Sci-Fi City，在紅藍兩軌道下近距離欣賞兩條高速過山車的速度感。沒有登上去都覺得太刺激啦！離開影城最後一站就是回到起點－迷你兵商店！帶了一些日後可以回憶的紀念品，還有整作了迷你兵紀念幣（S$2/個，最便宜的紀念品），心滿意足的離開了～

review_382634596,“It was just okay!”,"I went here on a Sunday with a friend and I'd say this place is definitely for kids. It was kinda boring! I've been to Disneyland so I guess once you've been to Disneyland nothing can impress you more. I loved the extreme couple extreme rides for adults though and the transformer ride. It's a good place to visit if you want to burn money and time, otherwise, just buy yourself a good meal instead in Singapore. ;-)

review_382631202,“Great day out with kids”,"Visited on a weekday during the school holidays, and it was crowded. Long queues to enter during opening but didn't have to wait too long to go in. Not a very big park, but there are rides suitable for kids and adults alike. As we visited with young children, we did not get to ride on the roller coasters but we had fun on the kiddy rides. The queues had shorter waiting times in the morning when there were shows going on, and also in the evening when half the crowd had left. If you do not have the whole day to spend here, getting an express ticket might be an option though pricey. Otherwise, you can enjoy all the rides without a queue in the evening.

review_382411149,“Loved it!”,"Great day out, not a massive sprawling theme park but they pack a good punch when it comes to rides.The Curse of the Mummy was by far the best ride. A completely indoor roller coaster, flames, vid screens and the best bit is 70% is in near darkness which adds to the thrill of it. 9.5/10Jurassic Park water ride, you will get soaking wet and thats half the fun, in Singas heat and humidity its a welcome soaking 8/10Madagascar ride, nothing hardcore about this one, takes place inside the marooned ship from the movie. You sail through the ship with various scenes from the movie played out as you ride. If your a fan of the movie ( as I am and im 44 lol) you will enjoy this 7/10"" the foosa are always crashing our parties and ripping our limbs off"" - King JulianShrek 4D, cool short movie where its 3D plus you move and feel as well 8/10 My advice is to buy express ride tickets with your park entry, you will thank me I guarantee.

review_382377432,"“No information, No hospitality mind at all”","Firstly, we bought our tickets at MRT ticket counter at Orchard station then we went there. At the gate the attendant girl said 'You cant get in this tickets,go guest service window', then went there, a guest service girl said 'You go to locker room!,,,,,,,,,' I replied what? locker room?' 'Yes' Even we could not understand why locker room, but we went there. So, we found the Scan Machine in the locker room. But machine wasn't able to connect the host computers, so we could not get print tickets and no attendant in the locker room, then I went back the gate ask help about our ticketing. A girl replied me 'you go to guest service!' Then I said 'I need your supervisor or manager right now' Finally s supervisor came with me to go back to the locker room, and she found machine broken down, then she did use her radio to call someone to fix it. We wasted more than 30mins. before went in site!! One another problem was so call 'universal express', when we made long long queue every ride in site, people went trough our side to go to ride without made queue. I asked many attendants but none of them could not able to answer, because every day and even time of the day those tickets may vary prices and no written information at all. Over all, almost impossible to meet attendants to ask help or assistance, only boys or girls standing each ride entrance. We felt very uncomfortable whole day. You have to study and research deeply well before you go there, otherwise you waste your time and money.

You can get wet in few rides so choose the rides with caution. Few roller coaster rides are extreme. They have rides for all ages and its super fun.

review_382330226,“Better than expected”,"Having been to Universal Studios in LA, we (2 adults and 3 children aged 18, 16, 12) were expecting something similar. Whilst this theme park doesn't have the back lot to tour through, there are still lots of rides for all ages. We had expected to buy an express pass but on the day we went, the queues were all ok, the longest being about 30 minutes and most were shorter. We had a great time and went on all the rides we wanted and saw all the shows we wanted in a short day. Definitely worth a visit.

review_382136833,“Small theme park with activities for all”,"If you have been to original one is US or to Paris, then this one will be a big disappointment as it is not only very small compare to them but not many rides & attractions also. However, if this is your 1st visit to studio, then you must go & will enjoy a lot. 1st of all, if it's very rushy, go for express pass only even though it is slightly expensive as at times there is such a long wait (upto 90 minutes for one ride) that you will waste time in queues & will eventually not able to cover the entire park in one day. Express pass takes you straight to the rides & if yu enjoy it, you can repeat it again & again. If you are a solo traveler, then go for normal ticket as they have separate que for solo riders which will avoid long waiting for you. Few rides & attractions are very boring & nothing great but depends whether you are a child or an adult. If yu take an express pass then you will able to cover entire studio as well as other attractions of resort sentosa with nite show at beach in one day.

However, it is not very attracting for families with teen children because most of the attractions are for young kids and there are more eateries than rides.
