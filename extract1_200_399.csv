review_382068408,“Amusing”,"Finally able to visit one of the places on my checklist. The whole place was amazing and the staff are very kind to take pictures for the visitors. However, I wish there were more rides to accommodate more people.

review_382062239,“An interesting place to be definitely.”,"Since this was the first theme park I visited, it was quite interesting. The rides were experience in themselves, and the performances and the small shows in each park was added advantage. My only gripe with the place is that they don't have vegan or pure vegetarian food options, but otherwise it is an amazing place to be.

review_382060835,“Queuing for 2 hours - no thanks ”,"Hard to enjoy a theme park when the lines are all between 45 and 120 minutes long. There is the option of buying a $50 express pass (in addition to the $70) entry, but it makes the day so expensive for what it is. Also the Rides need to be better organised

review_382048606,“If you like waiting in lines go here”,"All very underwhelming as an experience. Staff seemed to be unhappy and very grumpy. Not the experience at Universal Studies would want to be linked to I am sure so not sure what has gone wrong with this franchise.The ""experiences"" seemed to be a little tired and in dire need of a refresh.Poor queue management to get through the turnstiles on arrival. Rather worrying was that there were no security checks on entry to the facility at all.Overpriced place to visit, but enough people seemed happy for pay for this.

review_381745333,“Awesome Fun”,"This was a great place to visit. Lots to see and do. The rides were awesome, ques weren't too bad. Only critisim is that staff aren't overly friendly and prices for drinks etc are expensive. You can find good that is amazing and reasonably priced. All in all a great day for both me and my son (15yrs) had a ball..... very clean and well organised.

review_381638029,“Splendid Theme Park!”,"Bought a triple attraction ticket for SGD 110/-. This included the cable car sky network + S.E.A.Aquarium + Universal Studios : all unlimited rides. Universal Studios has 6 sections, namely : Madagascar, Far Far Away, The Lost World, Ancient Egypt, Sci-Fi city and New York. Each of these sections has many rides and attractions that will keep you at your wits end. A really unforgettable and enjoyable experience.Check the weather before going because some rides will not operate in inclement weather conditions.

review_381584580,“USS Visit”,"Good to purchase the tickets before hand, some places do sell them at cheaper price eg. Changi Airport Attractions Counter, hostel, etc. Strongly advise to get Express tickets to save time queuing up, but Express tickets can only be purchased at USS. Do take note not all rides provide Express lane service, good news is most popular rides do.Long queues start to form waiting for entry into the park before the opening hour, fortunately they are cleared quite quickly once the park opens, so hang on and don't rush. Most thrilling rides : Transformers, Cyclone & Human Roller Coasters, Mummy.Children will love Madagascar & Sesame Street rides, and the Sesame Street musical show. The 4D Shrek show is worth watching. The ride on the Lost World will get you quite wet, including your shoes! Don't forget to go for the Steven Spielberg Studio, the entrance is not so prominent and inviting, but it certainly is a show not to be missed. You have to put all your bags and loose items in lockers for Rollor Coaster & Mummy rides, rental is free of charge for the first 55 minutes. But the locker at Lost World is chargeable at SGD$4.00 (yes, not free!). Duh... I cannot understand too.

review_381532958,“This is a must when visiting Sentosa”,"USS is a place of wonderment and joy.... having never been to a movie themed park before, we found the experience one we will never forget. An express pass is a must if you only have one day to get around the park, it will make your experience more enjoyable.... BUT BE AWARE FOR LITTLE KIDS THE EXPRESS RIDE IS REALLY ONLY GOOD FOR SPAGHETTI RIDE/THE SHOW/MADAGASCAR, the ride near the Mummy ride, no longer has express which would be disappointing as it would be a littles winner. The other ride eg/ merry-go-round, always has seats.Grab an events of the day flyer and aim to be at Waterworld... grab lunch and take it in, its a great spot to watch and eat!! We love universal...

review_381523014,“family visit”,"Universal studios is not very big, you could get around it twice in a day easily doing all the rides. We did not do the big roller coaster as we were with our young children, but we did most of the other rides, kids loved it and we had a good day out. Get the fast pass or by late afternoon you will take ages to get on the rides.

review_381520169,“Enjoyable place if you have patience”,"This is one of the most popular attractions is Singapore especially if you have kids. Singapore weather is hot so try not to visit in summertime or if you have no choice, bring a hat and sunscreen. Another tip is not to bring big bags because they are not allowed in some rides like rollercoasters. If you need to bring one, there are lockers for rent. In our case, I did not ride because I am not fond of rollercoasters so I could watch our bags. Universal closes early on weekdays (7pm) and 8pm on saturdays. Try to be there early or you won't finish the rides. The lines are looong and some rides could close at thunderstorm warnings. If you have extra money to buy the fast pass, I think they are worth it because you can ride all you can without lining up. We should have done this! Next time we know better.

review_381330393,"“Day well spent - Minions, Human/Cylon, Mummy, Jurassic Park”","Went to USS in May during our S'Pore trip. Me, wife and kid along with Parents (65+). Got unlimited express pass for me, wife and kid. Got regular express pass for parents. The three of us would try a ride and then if the intensity was low we would repeat with our parents. We enjoyed all the rides / shows. Especially - Jurassic Park, Puss in Boots, Mummy, Human/Cylon, Water World. Transformers was a little bit of let down.Parents went to Madagascar, Puss in Boots, Shrek, Water World. Father skipped Jurassic Park due as he has a cardiac condition.Comparing to other Universal Studio's - Having been to USF, USH, USJ and USS - I feel the attractions are more modern compared to USJ which still features Back to the Future, Terminator etc. Probably at same level of fun as USH. USF still gives more bang for the buck because of Wet'n'Wild and Islands of Adventure.

review_381317609,“Exciting Fun-Filled Day”,"There are a number of attractions in the park but amongst the favourite is the Canopy ride and Puss in the Boots ride. They are not the daredevil type ides but gentler and scenic type rides but still exicting. The making of a Category 5 hurricane in Lights, Camera and Action theatre is also interesting and imaginative. There are a number of food outlets within the park and bringing in outside food is prohibited. There are also a number of restaurants and cafes within 100 metres outside the park which are open till late night where one can have dinner. Official photos with characters taken by park staff are generally expensive to purchase but the staff will also be happy to use your camera to help take photos at no cost. Plain water is permitted to be brought into the park and you can replenish water at several water points in the park at no cost.

review_381170070,“Best vacation trip with young children ”,"We went to Singapore to celebrate our only daughters 7th birthday. We spent one day at the USS. We reached sentosa by a cab and got tickets directly at the USS counters. I was first hesitant to pay SGD50 extra per person for the express pass as it amounts to INR7500/- for the three of us. But finally I took it and it's the best thing I've done. The wait time for popular rides was upto 180 minutes also. And we got them done in like 10 minutes. So I recommend the express pass if you really want to enjoy the rides or else you'll get stuck up waiting for hours to gether. Summer afternoons can get really hot so be prepared. The best rides 1. Transformers - amazing. Don't skip this. 2. Cyclon & Hunan roller coasters - must do for the adrenaline junkies 3. Jurassic park Rapids - do it for the experience of being transported to the Jurassic times. Rest all were also good. Food court was as usual like any other park. Over all must go with kids. And TAKE the express pass

review_381109091,"“Finally got to visit, and it was great!”","My wife and I have been waiting a long time to visit USS and we finally got the chance after 2 previous attempts. Seems we came during the Singapore school holidays, but not too busy. Transformers was really cool, and we actually went for it again towards the end of the day. A bit of a long queue for the Battlestar rollercoaster but lucky we bought the express tickets. My wife mistakenly left her camera in the washroom near the entrance, but thanks to your staff Cheryl and Grace at the Lost and Found counter we managed to retrieve it back. Really thankful for their reassurance and prompt follow up. We had bites at a few places. One was Goldilocks chicken, it was quite crowded and waited a bit long to queue. Our order was not complete as we had to wait for our side dish to be prepared, but the floor manager Siva really went out of his way to personally deliver the food to us and apologised for the wait. He was genuinely friendly. Ben and Jerry ice cream was nice but pricey compared to what we can buy outside. We also had the Chicken rice at the Discovery food court. Not bad but it's very expensive, especially as the meal is without drink so we have to pay another $4 for a drink. The floor manager Lesh was very helpful in giving us suggestions for what we wanted to order actually while we were looking at the menu, and it was nice to see him helping a older man carry his tray of food to the table while we were queuing to pay for our food. We left around 6:30pm after coming in at 11am plus, so it was really a whole day adventure. Generally all the staff around the various areas are quite welcoming and friendly, especially the staff at the Sesame Street shop. Although I think the staff who are escorting the dance group were a bit rude to those who wanted to take pictures (we managed to get ours but those behind use were cut off), I think they could handle that better. We plan to come back later this year, maybe in December. What a great time we had!

The waiting times for some rides were insane when we first arrived but as it got later these went done. Fantastic rides really well thought out. Also some good activities for all to partake in for example the special effects show. The only downside is that some of the queues for the rides go up stairs, these tend to not have air con/fans so can get very warm and stuffy so just bare that in mind.All in all a fantastic day out and well worth the money.

review_380115508,“Fun day out. ”,"i. Reached there about 1030. First thing is to walk around and plan where you want to go. ii. The Lost World opens at 1100. So we waited for it to open and did one roller coaster without queue before visiting Water World. - Strongly recommend Water World show. The first one is 1130, then 1300 then 1700. - If budget isn't a constrain, go for express pass so you skip 75% of waiting time. - Great place to bring your girlfriend or children (if any) o Water World was fun, mesmerizing, action packed and lots of stuns! It is a must to visit when you're in USS. Lots of pyrotechnics, it is live action movie!! You might get very very wet to very wet. Just bear in mind. ;)o Lost World was fun but the roller coaster was a brief ride. Try the hydroelectric one, you'll get abit wet but fun. o SciFi ride is the best of the best. Try the cyclon, much better than humans. o Transformer one was a 4D ride. Quite exciting if you're a big fan of transformer.o New York and Hollywood are well done. Beautiful. o Castle of Far Far Away is magical. More for kids though. o Mel's Drive-In girls are gorgeous and adorable. o Classical cars! Men's favorite! o Interesting ancient Egypt. Although we didn't manage to get a ride there. x Long long long queue. We waited for 2 hours just for the <2 minutes cyclon ride.x No one is hyped about Madagascar anymore. x Be prepared for expensive food. :)x One day is enough to play 65% of the whole USS. You probably need 2 days and express pass for 100% experience. x We experience two short delays during the wait. One for transformer and the other for Cyclon ride. Delay added up to be almost 40 minutes lost. :(

Some rides like Transformers and roller coaster can be almost 2 hours wait in line for a 10 minute thrill. McKinsey Consulting that did research for Universal Studio is correct to introduce premier pricing for express lane. Pay bit more for your express lane ticket will allow more rides in one day. A cheaper ticket which allow only 3 good rides in one day actually makes each ride more experience as one is trading your time.

review_379570960,“Family trip to USS”,"We visited USS on the Friday before Singapore School Holidays started with our 5 & 6 year old. We purchased our dated tickets online (including express passes). It was quite busy in the morning becoming busier over the day, but easy to enter and find our way around. It is quite easy to walk all around the park, everything is close by. We spent most of our time in the Madagascar and Jurassic Park areas for our kids. They were able to go on most rides accompanied and enjoyed all of them. Some parts of the park open an hour or so after entrance time, so be aware you may have to come back later for some rides. We used our express passes quite a bit as the day went on as some queues were up to 1 hour and it is very warm/humid. Definitely take hats and sunscreen and plenty of water. We ate at the Marty's Casa Del Sol food court which was very reasonably priced. We easily spent the whole day there which was very tiring, but enjoyable.

review_379417780,“I want more!!”,"My second time in Singapore but my first time in Universal Studios Singapore. Ok, so my goal for the day was to try Battlestar Galactica and Revenge of the Mummy. It opens at 10am but we got there at around 11am. I would suggest going there at opening time to make the most out of it.We took note of the outdoor shows we wanted to see but then, it proved to be useless later on. Due to the haze and a little rain, they cancelled a lot of outdoor shows and closed some of the outdoor rides. Bummer. Our first stop was the The Rockefellas show at the Palace. We stayed for the show, took pictures at the Met steps (feeling Gossip Girl!) and then went to TRANSFORMERS The Ride. Transformers The Ride was so painstaking. We queued for almost 2 hours. 2 freakin hours. We wasted so much time!My friend who didnt come with us to the ride was able to see Betty Boop and the Mel's Dinettes show. We went to the Puss in Boots' Giant Journey ride next. There it is again - the long queue! I honestly thought that because it's a Monday, there won't be a lot of people, but we were so wrong! It's like a mini roller coaster and it was quite fun.After the ride, it was almost time for The Dance of the Magic Beans show so we stayed in that area. We decided to have lunch while waiting. Then, a few minutes before the show, they announced that it was cancelled. Huhu. My other friend went to the souvenir shop and only saw a glimpse of Puss. Why is he so elusive?! When she got back, we went to the Donkey Live show instead - which was really really funny! It's very interactive and I'm sure the kids had a blast!Right after that, we rushed to the Water World but when we got there, they announced that it was also cancelled. Dammit. I was actually looking forward to that show. We heard so many good things about it. Huhu.We went to the Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure next. We brought our own rain coats with us so we were soooo ready to get wet and wild! The queue was super long so my friend and I decided to do the single rider thing. We were right in front, in a snap! While waiting, they kept announcing that they might close the ride due to weather conditions. We kept our fingers crossed but then after a while, they announced that they're closing the ride. Huhu. Not wanting to waste any time, we went to Revenge of the Mummy instead.Again, we took the single riders queue. We still waited for quite a long time but luckily, My friend and I were still on the same train. She was right behind me. Ok, this ride could've been pretty scary if it wasn't too dark. It was just ok for me.After this ride, we went back to Jurassic Park and yaaaay, they have re-opened it. This time around, there weren't a lot of people yet so we took the regular queue. We entertained ourselves by gossiping about the people around us. Ok, of all the rides we've tried, I probably liked this the most. I didn't have any expectations because I was thinking, this is just going to be like EK's Rio Grande. But there was a part where we thought, they were going to drop us. They actually did, but sideways. But totally love that feeling when you are unsure of what's exactly going to happen. So yeah, that's why this is my favorite. We didn't have much time left so we thought of just going around, take pictures everywhere. We went back to Battlestar Galactica but the waiting time is still 60 minutes. Seriously, the park is closing in an hour! Ain't got no time for that. Would have loved to try this though.We went to the Madagascar zone since that's the only part of the park we haven't visited. We rode the Madagascar: A Crate Adventure because there was no queue. It's just like Disneyland's It's a Small World. But OMG, there was a surprising twist! The falls!!! I hurriedly looked for my rain coat inside my bag, then it stopped. Seriously - that almost gave me a heart attack!!! We took a very quick photo op around the remarkable areas in the Hollywood zone. I think I like the Far Far Away zone the best! Super love the photos we took there! We went out before 6pm because we don't want to go with the influx of people exiting USS. All in all though, it wasn't so tiring because it's a lot smaller than Disneyland. I didn't feel like amputating my leg afterwards due to the pain. LOL. Wanna go back though to try the other rides! :( Maybe I'll purchase the fast pass next time!

review_379308523,“Express Pass is not valid for all attractions”,"Awesome place albeit a little bit smaller than USS America. Not much attractions but enjoyed our time there. The rides were great especially Transformer and Jurassic Park and be prepared to get a little bit wet for the latter.Even though the theme park is small but still need at least a whole day to fully enjoyed all the attractions.Highly recommend to buy the express pass as it will save a lot of waiting time. Some attractions need at least 60 min waiting time. Imagine all the time wasted waiting in line. However be prepared to feel a bit cheated as the express pass is not valid for all the attractions. Found this first hand at Treasure Hunter, Canopy Flyer and so on. This is a major let down as we paid so much for express pass but end up waiting in line.

review_379274933,“Wholesome fun and entertainment”,"1st imp point- Buy your tickets preferably online. Look out for many websites which offer discounted entry fee. Even the Resort world Sentosa has special offers. If you are going with kids you need to plan the rides in advance as they have rides with height restrictions. The express pass is very helpful as you dont have to wait in long lines. Dont miss the main rollercoaster rides. Meeting Shrek got a bit uncertain. Their program showed that Shrek meet and greet will start from 12.20pm till 5 pm. We kept waiting as my daughter was very keen. Shrek and Fiona finally came out only after 4pm. There are many eateries but quite expensive. You need an entire day only for Universal studios

The queue for some rides can be very long. Suggest to purchase the Express Pass which can reduce queueing time. Some 4-D shows are quite interesting just like riding the movie. Characters photography can be quite long queue for popular ones. Visited the studio at night once, it's pretty colourful too.Enjoyed. A whole day needed for first timer to the park (10am - 5pm).

review_379063951,“A Day Full of Fun with Express Pass”,"First, when you plan a trip to Singapore, make sure to include Universal Studios in your agenda. I was fortunate enough to have visited several times but it was the most recent that we opted to use the express pass. This may have been the best decision we have made. Although you pay premium price for it, the benefit outweights the cost and really ads so much value on your visit. Plus, the most valuable benefit of the express pass is your time. 5 mins on queue was the longest we had to wait as opposed to an average of 90 mins. When you are travelling and have limited time to spend, I recommend getting the express pass and this will give your a whole lot more adventure in one day. You can finish the best rides in a matter of a few hours rather than spending your whole day standing on queue.

review_378517728,“A perfect place to embrace your inner child”,"I went here with my cousin and we had a lot of fun. One of the best themed amusement park! If you are an adrenaline junkie then you should try the roller coaster. Universal Studio Singapore has 2 adult roller coasters, The Cyclone and The Human. I tried both of them, but The Cyclone was way scarier and definitely more fun. You also should try transformers (it's a must), the mummy (also a must), and jurassic park rapid adventure (buy a poncho if you don't wanna get wet). If you come with children then i would recommend all of the above except the mummy and of course adult roller coaster. Shrek 4-D adventure, shrek junior rollercoaster, and water world also great attraction for children. USS was very crowded on holiday season, but the upside is sometime they have a special event or parade during a holiday. And i wouldn't recommend for elderly people. In USS, you also can take a picture with the mascot, like minions, elmo, betty boop, shrek and tons of other mascot. The merchandises were cute and unique, but kinda overpriced.

Took the sentosa express from Harbourfront MRT which gives good photos from the top.Food entry to uss is restricted even though it is for kids only.you need to purchase SGD 15 locker for 1 day if you plan to spend entire day.Too much crowd for the major coaster attractions such as galectica, transformers,jurassic park etc.Waiting times stretch to almost 1 hour + that too on weekdays.You cannot complete all the attractions even if you spend whole day. They charge for additional lockers once inside for few roller coaster rides which could be easily managed by having free counters near the rides.Overall you end up standing for long times waiting for the rides.Food options as usual are costly inside the park.

review_378164873,“Getting the Express may be worth it”,"We visited USS on a Monday. It was still pretty crowded (maybe due to school holidays). The average waiting time from the time it opened to about 1600 hours is 60mins. The waiting time started to reduce to an average of 20-25 mins after six. We wasted so much time just waiting in line for the rides. It maybe better off topping up/getting tickets with express access to rides. After all, we only managed to cover probably 1/2 of the whole park over six hours or so. The park is clean and well maintained. We felt the closing time could be extended to about 9pm or so. It is just too early for a theme park to be closed at 7pm (during school holidays) or on normal days. Extending the closing time allows guests to take a rest in between rides and I believe that will enhance the experience further.

review_377843797,“Awesome”,"Simply Superb. Only advice but your tickets online or from Changi Airport. Trust me you will save SGD 25... I did the same and got mine for SGD 70....so buy these tickets at the airport. Same ticket at Universal is for SGD 100.Good easy access from Singapore. Take the metro or cab to Vivo City and then take the Sentosa Express. First stop is Universal. Awesome place for everyone and for all age groups. Lots of eating options but very expensive and quality is atrocious.....But a serious Warning: if you want to do any rides then eat only when u are leaving from Universal. The rides will throw ur stomach in a weird zone... So don't eat at all at best an ice cream or two... Must do:Transformers Ride. My personal Favourite Check out the animation and hold on to ur seats cause u will fall.... ( Now let's keep that as a surprise)Two Roller coasters after the main Transformers rideEgypt one is crazy. ( Do not and I mean do not even think of eating before this one) Jurassic Park is ok. Just a tip incase one carries bags and needs to use the lockers. Keep the bags at the Egypt locker area those ones are the cheapest. Lots for kids to see and do.Food is terrible and expensive. Eat light and while leaving take the Sentosa Express come to Vivo and eat there has better food and more variety and quality is top Notch.

review_377832756,“Think before you leap!”,"I know it's Universal and you want to get there early and stay till they kick you out! But take a deep breath and hear me out. After 3 visits to Universal (1 in LA and 2 in Singapore), the best advice we've received and followed was - do the shows first and keep most of the rides for after 3pm. Before you frown, think about it - Universal shuts at 7pm and the waiting time for the rides reduces dramatically later in the day. Nothing says that better than our experience with the always popular Transformers ride. Every time we passed by that ride the wait was 60-120mins!! But we took a look after 4pm and it was 15mins; we did it twice in 45mins!!!So I would suggest you get in and soak in the atmosphere, grab a bite, do some shopping (if you have to!) and do all the shows you want. Do a few rides if the waiting time is sensible but keep the big ones for later. Enjoy!

Please note though, nothing is really open until 11 am. The only ride I thought was a waste of time was the treasure hunters ride, we waited 45mins for a 5 min ride. They should state somewhere at the entrance of the ride how long it goes for. Queuing for that long in that humidity is exhausting. Nowhere to sit and have a beer or wine, which seems to be in most places. Plenty of restaurants.

You need at least one full day to see everything, on busy days you might need two days depending on the queues.

Its one of the craziest experiences during halloween when they have their halloween horrors nights. You have to try it during Halloween. The extreme rides are not that extreme, and the food and drinks are naturally expensive, but all in all a good place to take the day off.

review_377471145,“Fun day at Universal Studios ”,"An action packed day full of laughing and fun, I definitely recommend booking the express pass, for us it was $30 and that got us into everything once which was more than enough... There was an alternative $50 pass which was unlimited. I'm glad we didn't get that as we didn't exhaust the pass we had. We agreed the ride of the day was the mummy, it was a real thriller. I personally really enjoyed the transformers ride and the waterworld show but beware.. When they say you'll get soaked, they actually mean it!I loved the street performers and my 4 year old loved the Sesame Street show. Bad stuff: You're not allowed to take food in and the options available are expensive and low quality. Queues are horrendous and because the staff are Walking the queues selling the express passes to people when they're vulnerable, even the express queues get longer during the day.... The trick is the get the express pass early and go for your life before the staff can recruit people......

We are a family of three ( two adults and a 4 year old).The lines and wait time at some rides are over an hour, so if you can afford it purchase the express pass to gain access to the express line.However please be careful if travelling with little kids like us. The plethor of INDIAN tourists who travelled to Universal Stiudios are rude obnoxious people who continually and constantly trampled our our little girl to get a head of the line. They do not respect personal space and hurt out little girl on countless occasions!!! The grounds are clean and have helpful staff throughout.

review_377310554,“Better experience if you have express pass”,"As expected, long queues for the popular rides though it was not super crowded. It is quite challenging having a 6yo boy tagging along. So, would definitely consider getting the express pass for the next visit (if ever). Was there from 10am-5pm, only got through half the attraction. Rain on that day didn't help and the opportunistic selling of plastic poncho (with staff suddenly popping out of nowhere) for $4 per pc dampen the mood further. For a place that is supposed to be HAPPY, most staff looked grumpy. It is easy to get a lost (especially for first timer) and staff prefer to yell. Some are nice but unfortunately thats a minority. Customer service training definitely needed.

review_377201393,“Fantasy Land”,"Its a small park ! but great for people who have never seen an American theme park with hollywood at its brightest. Location - In Sentosa . Best way to get there from the middle of the city - metro take the line to Harbor front get off at Vivo mall walk the 10 minute boardwalk and enter Sentosa for free ( or pay 4$ and wait in line to take the monorail - 3 min ride ) . Or take a cab from the CDB and pay $20SGD. Any way ! Pay 74$SGD for a full day pass - but a caveat there are waiting times ...loooong ones if you come late - try and be here by 10 am so you get to go quick . Start from the opposite direction ! New York , Transformers ( hands down the winner !) , roller coasters , more roller coasters ! and lots of Photo Ops - carry the camera for the best memories . Anything that can be branded and sold to kids is there so carry a heavy budget for souvenirs , t shirts , mugs , dolls, food , photo ops , popcorn ! If you have the money and not much time take the Express pass - most convenient ! just breeze past everyone else ! ( one mistake we made !) This is if you want to do Universal and Sentosa all in One day - else if you have all the time you need 5-6 hours only in here to really enjoy yourself . Food - plenty of options , the one near Shreks castle has great fried chicken , juices , burgers . Dont miss this one for a real taste of hollywood !

I didn't end up doing the rides (some had a wait time of 60 mins and Singapore is very hot - throw chronic motion sickness in and forget it ) however there are a number of shows, air conditioned shops and cafes to visit. The water world show is a must - great special effects as does the special effects show (funny about that). I also enjoyed the shrek 4D show and various acts just wandering round the grounds - the most amusing being when a person asked the ""keeper"" if the dinosaur she was displaying was real!.

review_377130244,“Amazing Theme Park!”,"This version of Universal Studios is relatively smaller than of others in US and Japan but it still entertains you to its very best and at the end of the day it will make your day happy and complete.Feedback: What i just i did not like is that there was no option to upgrade to an express pass if you purchased the Singapore Tourist Pass. I think they should work that out next time rather than asking guests to pay in full for the express pass.I think they have to reconsider extending their operating hours. It's currently at 10AM - 7PM but i believe extended it 2 more hours will not hurt them. Tips: Get the Express Pass!! This will save you a lot of time and will enable you to cover everything in the park for the whole day. Buy your water before you enter this park to save some money!

review_376997081,“Good theme park”,"USS Singapore is great in visiting. Plan to reach early and enter by 10AM. Complete Transformers first, then mummy ride, then jurassic park ride, then shrek 4D and then others to avoid crowds. My review of the park - 1. Transformer ride is really awesome.2. Other 3 main attraction - mummy, jurassic and shrek is great. But average experience. Also to mention Spielberg show here.3. The roller-coaster rides are really awesome and daring one. Specifically the cyclone one as it also puts you in the inverted position - if you are not comfortable would suggest to skip cyclone and go with human roller coaster, as cyclone is definitely more difficult to adapt.4. Rest all so-so5. The water stunt show was closed when I visitedAs one of the main attraction was closed and jurassic park ride was also getting frequently closed, I felt disappointed. Overall my rating is average thats why.

Normally they provide a free period of for you to experience the ride, but it is generally not enough and every ride will cost you $4 ~ $6. A trick to earn extra income by park?Food is average, a lot instant food include restaurant. Better option is go out to have lunch and come back again.Ride often close for maintenance especially the Battlestar Galactica roller coaster.

The longest we waited was 30min at the big roller coaster. On average I would estimate that we stood in line for about 15 min on each attraction. I have been to the original Universal studios park in Hollywood, and in comparison the park in Singapore has more of a Disney world feel to it. But it's my opinion that it's well worth a visit if you find yourself in Singapore and have the time.

Downsides: food and drinks were ridiculously expensive. The park is small and doesn't offer enough thrills for the fee it charges. I was lucky because I got to the park early and choose the nicest rides before it got busy but I did come across one situation where I had to wait really long to enter the Battlestar Galactica rollercoaster because the staff kept letting in Xpress pass customers first (they do pay for having priority access but why not mix regular customers with Xpress pass customers instead of not letting us in and pauze the ride untill enough Xpress pass customers have arrived). Transformers the ride and the revenge of the mummy blew me away, they were 2 awsome experiences. The most boring thing was the Lights, Camera, Action ride presented by Steven Spielberg.

review_376327072,“Tips to save money to make the USS experience value-for money!”,"Visits to theme parks are always expensive affairs. We want to have fun, yet not spend the equivalent of a budget plan ride to KL. I've been to USS a couple of times and I thought to share with everyone on how enjoy your time in USS and save some money as well to make the experience value-for money.Tip 1 - Bring your own drinks or use the water coolers at each ride. As expected, riding the coasters in a typical Singapore weather will leave you high and dry (pun intended). There are drinks on sale, but they cost a bomb (like at least $4 for a bottled water). Bring your own drinks, or use the water coolers conveniently located at each ride.Tip 2- Eat outside USS. The food in USS is exorbitant and way above the usual rates of Sentosa. However, you can save some money (at least $5 per meal) if you leave USS to eat outside at Astons or the Malaysian Street Food. Just remember to get the re-entry stamp so you can go back and enjoy the rides after your meals. Tip 3 - Go straight to the Transformer ride or Battlestar ride once you enter into USS at 10am, as both rides have notoriously long queues so save the time by going for those first! And remember to remove ALL your belongings before going into the queue because they will reject you if you have your keys/handphone on you! Tip 4 - Go during off-peak to avoid the crowd! Which brings us to Tip 5...Tip 5- Get the express tickets if you're going during peak season - i.e.weekends, public holidays, school holidays (June/Dec). Tip 6 - Look out for special deals. I got 50% off for my 2nd ticket due to a union card membership.Tip 7 - Plan your rides carefully so that the rides are within your travel route!Enjoy!!!

The most thrilling bits were the two drops of your raft on the waterfalls, and soon after you just want to go on the ride all over again. The other simulated rides were worth all the wait in the long queues, which was the only drawback, but they seemed to move fast so again no real problems.

If u plan to ride all the rides and watch the stage shows it is definently worth forking out the extra cash to purchase the additional ticket known as the ""Express Ticket"" on top of the normal price admission ticket. This ticket allows u to go directly to the Express Lane for all rides/shows which only takes a very short wait compare to the normal admisson tickets the line in que could be anywhere from an hour to two hours just for one ride..and try not to leave the park between 6pm to 8pm as the taxi que will be very very long..Have a Happy Fun Day...Good Luck.

review_375357796,“Certainly the most fun part of our Singapore trip”,"My wife and I visited Universal Studios - Singapore last year and undoubtedly this was the most fun part of our whole trip. We spent around 7-8 hours here and it was totally worth it. We took almost all the rides except ""Puss In Boots"" because there was a waiting time of more than 1 hour. ""Transformer"" and ""Revenge of the mummy"" are the most thrilling and not to be missed rides of this adventure/theme park. I repeat Do NOT miss these rides! Only one complain - food here is expensive and doesn't taste good. But still If you're traveling to Singapore for the first time, you should visit this place.

review_375319908,“Great park”,"The park is very well maintained. It's better than MovieWorld on the Gold Coast, QLD Australia, but smaller than the one in LA, USA. Unfortunately we visited on a public holiday and not only was it hot and humid but the lines were really long. Our highlights were Lost World and Far Far Away. Souvenirs were reasonably priced.

review_375291503,"“Proportionally sized, good for single day visits”","USS is naturally smaller than the USS in the US, of course. The country is smaller than Rhode Island so the theme park can't be that huge.It's sized just right for a single-day trip and you'll most likely get to try at least half of the attractions easily. The most crowded ones are often the family-friendly ones, which is normal for theme parks.Transformers, Jurassic Park Canopy, and Jurassic Park main ride are the longest lines, which could take 30min or so to queue.Getting an Express pass would definitely help and worth the price.Battlestar Galactica and The Mummy have much shorter lines partly because the machines can sit a lot more people per ride and less people are inclined to try thrill rides (esp young ones).Situated in Resorts World means you are not confined to USS food outlets as well. At the end of the day, you can dine in a lot of restaurants.Speaking of food, each segment of the park offers a different type of cuisine, which is great. From western to Indian to Chinese food, you have options.We're locals and we live 5min from USS and have visited more than 30x at least. My advise is visit on a week day, preferably Mon-Wed during non-holidays (Google ""Singapore School Holidays""). We have a season pass and whenever we go during a weekday, even Transformers ride has less than 5min queue and we just go over and over and over again.

review_374997900,“A trip highlight - made me feel like a kid again!”,"In order of my ride preferences: The Mummy, Cylon, Transformers, Jurassic Park Rapids, Human. We also enjoyed the 4D Shrek movie, and even the Donkey comedy show. As we were grown adults (25, 31 and 65), we got bored with the kiddie rides (Sesame Street and Madagascar river ride).We went there on a Thursday - got there around 10.30am and left after 7pm - but still it was not enough to ride all attractions (we haven't gotten around to the Lights Camera Action) and missed some of the street shows. There was also a thunderstorm warning that afternoon, so all the rides were shut down for almost an hour. Food options are numerous, albeit on the expensive side. We brought bottled water with us, and just refilled it throughout the day (there are a lot of water fountains around). I think, since it was a weekday, there weren't any long lines to the toilets, either. Tip: Go on a weekday (Tue-Thu) for shorter queues, and buy the Unlimited Express Pass (additional SG$50) to skip the lines. We first went on Transformers and the queue was 1.5 hrs long; after, we started lining up for Cylon but the queue time was 80mins+ by then, so we decided to buy the Express Pass - and there was virtually no waiting time, and we even got on the front seats of the roller coaster rides since we had ""priority."" Not all rides are covered by the Pass, though, so do first the rides included in the Pass, and if one still has time, the other rides. We were able to ride Cylon, Human, and Transformers twice. Also, if you can, bring an umbrella. The day we were there it was hot and sunny from 11am-4pm, and drizzled a bit in the late afternoon.

review_374746887,“Fun Filled Day for Adults and Kids”,"The place is great playground for adults and kids. You can literally experience the movies like Transformers, The Mummy, Battlestar Galactica, Shrek, Jurassic Park, etc. I recommend all the roller coasters, especially the Battlestar Galactica Cylon Roller Coaster, it is amazing! Too bad the waiting time is very long, especially for the popular rides can take up to 120 minutes! For Indonesians, be ready to spend some money on food, as it is quite expensive (food cost around SGD 5.50 and above, soft drink around SGD 3.5), to save some money on water, you can bring empty bottle inside and fill it at the many water stations around the park.

review_374719749,“Second time around”,"We were able to experience the place before during their pre opening promo. There were some rides that are still in the testing stage so there were some rebate given before. We also went with an elderly person on wheelchair. We were impressed with their service and accommodation to the elderly as they prioritize us knowing that the elderly is only limited to some rides. They will make sure that the elderly can still see the ride.This time, I guess with the full operation. We now are with 3 elderly. We are happy that there are still some priority given to them. They also apologized for us queuing the line for the photo with characters as they said we should just go in front. Though for roller coaster or fast ride, they would say that the ride is fast so told us to leave the elderly somewhere and we have to queue the normal line. Overall, it was hot but still fun.

review_374591188,“The whole family will enjoy this”,"SINGAPORE WITH KIDS : THE KIDDY TRAVEL DIARY2Share14ShareTweet0Pin0ShareSingapore With Kids : The Kiddy Travel DiarySingapore scrapbook cover 2I promised myself that this year I take my kids along in my journey and I am so glad I am being able to slowly bring them on the same page. I want them to experience the world as I believe nothing teaches better than travel and exploration. My elder son has created this entire travelogue on his own, so this one is through his eyes but my words.I have listed Singapore as one of the top cities to visit as a family and this summer we explored Singapore with Kids! But before I go further in my blog, I would like to mention that DO NOT plan to go to Singapore in summers ever!! It’s hot and humid and the sun just made us sick. I googled the time of the year that you should visit Singapore, something I should have done earlier when I planned this holiday. Our travel journey started from Chennai to Singapore so from one hot destination to another. Anyway, mid to end October is just a perfect time to head there.p.s. Singapore weather is humid and it’s rains here unpredictably, so packing some foldable umbrellas and waterproof footwear will be a good idea.Travelling within the city:We reach Singapore 2Singapore needs around 4-5 nights to cover the entire city. The good thing is that it’s very well connected with the metro and public transport.Taxis are cheap most places within 15-25 min and fare between 15-20 dollars, of course, it depends on where you are staying. Our stay was at a service apartment in Orchard street which was central.p.s.There is a Sentosa shuttle which is for free starts from Vivocity mall and takes you straight to Sentosa Islands. Alternatively, you can also take a cable car from Vivocity into Sentosa.Without much ado, here is our travel itinerary of Singapore which will help you to plan yours;Day 1: Singapore ZooWhen you browse for information you will realise that there are multiple options available like Jungle safari , Night safari and River safari for kids to experience at the zoo. What you may not realise is that they are showing you mostly the same set of animals in different settings, so don’t waste your money trying to do all. Mom had experienced the night safari earlier and this time, she decided that we should try the Jungle safari. While night safari is a unique experience but you don’t get to see many animals in the dark, it is kind of scary and still awesome. There are a variety of shows over there. Watch out! They might choose someone in a show and make you pet a baby python, and when you’re at it, two people bring a huge baby python, and you may wet your pants if they tell you to pet it. There is a place where your kids can play over during the jungle safari. I would say that the River safari is the best way to see all the animals. So choose which one are you going to try.Singapore zoo 2Evening: You can head to Clarke Quay, which is an entire with best views of Singapore and bars. While this is not a kiddy destination, kids are allowed and so parents can enjoy a few drinks. There is also a river cruise which you can take there.Day 2: Universal Studios.Located on the Sentosa Islands, this can take up your entire day, so best to maximize it with kids. The good thing about Universal studios the rides are not all ‘kiddy’, so you will enjoy them as much as your kids. The transformer 7D ride, the dinosaur water slide ride, and Steven Spielberg’s special studio effects are worth it. They also have certain shows which happen at fixed times at fixed venues like Waterworld again worth watching. One thing to remember is not to head to this place on a weekend or you will end up in long lines. We went on a really hot Monday at 10 am and still had lines.

We bought our tickets online back home and the day before we were on Sentosa Island so bought some express pass tickets (which we later realised we didn’t need at all because we managed to do all the rides without waiting too long – we went on a Tuesday). We headed to the big rides (Battlestar, Transformers and the Mummy) before the queues got too long and then worked our way around the park and went on everything else. We managed to catch the Waterworld performance and Donkey Live (which wasn’t that great) and then at the end of the day when we had done everything, we used our express passes to go on the Human v Cylon rollercoaster again. We had a great day out and although the park isn’t as big as the Universal in Florida, we still had lots of fun. There are plenty of places to eat within the park so you won’t go hungry but do remember to bring a bottle of water with you as it can get very hot walking around.

review_374098642,“Equally enjoyable: adults and kids alike!!”,"Definitely not to be missed during your Singapore visit. A full day attraction, take your time, reach early. Enjoy!The transformers, The mummy, and 4D movies together with the Jurassic Park ride are among my favorites. Try and carry water bottles, as it can get pretty humid in Singapore during the day, although the facility provides drinking water at few points, it's still worth to carry your own, especially for top ups.Try and avoid weekends especially Sundays, as the place can get pretty crowded with both locals and tourists. Quite a few eating joints inside, so food is definitely not too much of an issue.The place is vast, so prepare to walk, get your map early to know which all places you would wanna see; if you see long queues at any attraction, just move on and visit others. If you r not too fond of queues, get the express pass.Stay till evening for the fireworks, it happens usually around 06-06:30pm, worth the wait.Kids will just looooveee this place!

The rides that I most enjoyed were the Battlestar Galactica (Human vs Cylon), Tranformers and Revenge of the Mummy. If you have younger/teenage children Universal Studios - Singapore would be a good place to go for rides that the whole family can enjoy, but as a couple seeking screams we found it a bit lacking.Alongside the rides, the highlight of my day was definitely ""Waterworld"" - this live-action show was laugh-out-loud funny and left us open-mouthed at some of the stunts. The cast members went out of their way to interact with the audience, and I can highly recommend that sitting in the splash zones was very helpful in cooling us down in the Singapore sunshine

review_373614318,"“Good Theme Park, but slightly limited ride Options”","We enjoyed our day at Universal Singapore. The kids were tall enough to do all the rides and we certainly did lots of rides during the day. I would highly recommend getting the Unlimited Express Pass. It is another $80 odd, but well worth it. We spend all day doing rides and hardly any time waiting in a queue. The rides themselves appeared to be extremely well maintained. The large rollercoaster was as smooth a rollercoaster as I have been on. So despite the fact I was only on the ride because the kids wanted to go, it was actually OK.The only slightly disappointing aspect is the limited number of different rides in the park.

review_373262685,“Great fun”,"My boys are 3.5 and 1.5years old and both had equally fun rides accordingly. Strongly suggest getting the Express pass as waiting for 5 minutes must feel like aaages for kids like mine. It rained for 3 hours but we still managed to catch the 5pm Waterworld show which was mind blowing and then headed straight to the Sesame Street musical where both the kids had so much fun watching Sesame Street characters come to life. Had it not rained we would've been out by 5pm as the venue is not as big as the one in California. But due to rain, we went home right after dinner at the Chinese Bistro (not recommended by the way). Coming back to the hotel was a challenge, there is a half hour wait for a free skytrain to Vivo City, a long long queue for taxi so we opted for an-all-in luxury coach for 50 dollars with no queueing. The driver told us that even taxis would have surge pricing due to location (Sentosa Island) and would end up paying the same (not sure whether this is true tho). But having young kids after a whole day at the amusement park we figured it was worth the money. Would definitely go back again as the kids grow older and can go into many more rides (together). They only have ONE atm spot and ONE baby's room which is the same as any toilet baby changing station within the park. Bring a lot of cash, if you want to spend at the food stalls. Souvenir shops have special 10% discount for purchases over 20 dollars with Mastercard which I took advantage of.

review_373003961,“Rainy day but still Fun”,"Despite the rainy Saturday morning, we decided to spend few hours at the Universal Studios Singapore (USS), an amusement park that opened its doors in 2010 and that has attracted lots of visitors locally as well as from overseas.We have been there numerous times and the place is packed with a variety of attractions in its seven thematic zones: Hollywood, Madagascar, Far Far Away, Lost World, Ancient Egypt, Sci-Fi City and New York.The park is relatively small compared to its bigger brothers in Florida, California or Japan but, despite the size, it is still capable to give you thrills and enjoyment and, for few hours, let you forget the stress of a daily life.For a complete visit and to experience all the rides including the Hollywood Dreams Parade, the Stage Shows (Water World not to be missed) as well as the fireworks one need probably to extend the visit throughout the whole opening time of the park, from 10AM to 8PM (thought the park will close earlier or later depending on the calendar).The place was not crowded and we managed to take most of the rides with short queuing time. For some of the most popular attractions (Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, Revenge of the Mummy, Transformers: The Ride) you can opt for the ""Single Ride"" entrance that will bring you on-board with little or no queue at all (although you have to be willing to ride without your friends or family in the same group).Of course the place is at its best during a sunny day but even with pouring rain you can spend some time inside the numerous stores, restaurants and cafes or simply walking through the covered areas at Hollywood or New York, not to mention that once reaching the attraction's entrance most of the queue areas are indoor or sheltered.Since its opening, we have been visiting this place few times every year and we keep coming back; we have even decided to subscribe for an annual membership that, however, makes sense only if you visit the park at least 3 times per year.

review_372761716,“A great place for family fun”,"This was my second visit to Universal studios and I was pleased all of the rides were operational including the dual battlestar galactica ride. My kids (10 and 11 yr old girls) loved the mummy ride and the Human roller coaster. Go on these at the beginning and the end of the day as the queues get long. Also joining the single rider queues help getting on the ride quicker (without the fast pass option). My only gripe is with the lockers near the mummy ride as they are not laid out well and during busy times there is too many people there trying to get their stuff out of lockers. I was rammed in there for 10 minutes trying to unlock my locker and then missed the free locker period. The biometric fingerprint key doesn't always work. Thankfully the attendant opened the locker, he seems to be permanently there opening lockers though so a better system /layout should be installed.

The shows and atmosphere as well as the character meets and the few rides he was comfortable with were more than enough to fill in the day.

Keep a minimum of 4 hours to cover the studio. Start from Madagascar (simplest and sweetest) to far far away to the lost world to ancient egyptians (underground ride and was a surprise) to cyclops (more difficult one) to transformers. If you are taking the Metro then it will drop you at Vivo City mall. From there you can take the Sentosa Express or take a 15 min walk. Avoid going on public holidays/ weekends.

review_372238456,“fantastic!!...thrilling!!! and absolutely!!!”,"This has to be the most exciting place in south east asia to visit for some thrilling excitement!!Hubby and i visited this place,and to tell you the truth we had an excellent time here,it was money well spent.We booked our tickets from RWS website and there was a Mastercard discount of 10% and they gave us 2 glass souvenirs!and you can also get your express pass for $50 as well.Please get the express pass,it speeds up things and you get to finish all the rides at a record breaking time.If you are staying in town,hitch a ride on the MRT that lead to harbourpoint at Vivo city mall.Of course you have the option of taking the skytrain to Sentosa which is about $4 per person.A much better option would be to head to the taxi stand and get a taxi to connect to RWS Casino for only $5,this is better and cheaper and minus all the hassle.Do the same when you want to get back to your hotel,take a taxi from RWS and get to harbourpoint at Vivocity mall and take the MRT back to the nearest point which is close to your hotel.If your hotel is a bit far off hitch a taxi ride to connect it usually comes lesser than $5 you save a lot on transport.As for the rides,if you have a short time don't go for Madasgascar and avoid Shrek 4D its a waste of time and really lame.Just head straight to Jurassic park and ride the rapids,make sure your items are waterproof as you get really wet in the rapids.Go for the waterworld show only at the end of the day.There is a kiddy dragon ride rollercoaster on the right somewhere after madagascar i think,try to avoid that too.Its a childs roller coaster but its really superfast for kids even.Basically everything in Universal studio is a roller coaster!The ""revenge of the mummy"" is really horrifying as they chuck you in the dark in a high speed roller coaster,be warned as its super scary and expect the unexpected!!!its definitely not for the weak hearted.We didn't go for the desert jeep ride,they said it was a slow ride for kids so we opted out of it and waiting time is 30mins.Transformers is another dissapointing ride with old faded graphics and some lame movement here and there with fake images of robots trying to get the so called car that you're in.The graphics are really outdated!!Do this only if you have absolutely nothing to do!The mother of all rides is the Battlestar galactica and Cyclon,the aliens give you a motivating inspiring talk on...""we must save the universe dear brothers and sisters,the time has come ""...and some bull like that,but its a whole load of fun!!...they launch both rides side by side and you meet halfway a few times screaming your lungs out!!...the cyclone just throws you out in mid air and you find yourself screaming OMG at the sky and staring at the sun for a few minutes,not knowing where you are!!!...great fun!Definitely not for the weak hearted!!Others like Lights,camera action is worth going for the sake of it.Overall if you do have time,do come back and get on all the other rides.We missed out puss in boots and other lame items.if you start at 11am,you can finish all this rides by 4pm with express pass.As for food,its pretty expensive,we had our meals at madagascar cafe and for a Briyani set which cost us singapore $16,its quite pricey for us malaysians even!every other meal or burger is minimum $10,so be prepared to pay.Lastly go for this experience and enjoy every bit of it!!

The rest of the rides are very ordinary, can be found in your own locality. There is not much 'theme' to this place, neither do you get a movie-feeling like in other similar setups. The arrangements are not conducive to handle the crowd. For example, the rock-climbing attraction has enough equipment to let 4 people climb, but only one coordinator. So only one can go at a time. The stunt show called water world is funny with random special effects and a special effects show 'hosted' by Spielberg looks very artificial. There's no point spending a whole day here, unless you are a ride maniac and confine yourself to four rides. I wouldn't go there again.

There are two types of Universal Express Pass, the one entry on each ride, and ride all you can, priced at 70 SGD and 90 SGD respectively. Express pass doesn't guarantee you no lines, but expect much much shorter lines. Even with an express pass, it will still take you a day to try out every attraction they offer. If you don't like to spend more for an express pass, try visiting around 4pm onwards, lines at this time tend to be shorter. Most attractions close at 8pm.Personally, I would recommend to save Galactica Cylon for last. It's the best ride they have. :D

review_371340827,“Great Day Out”,"Universal Studio is an amazing place to visit with family. You can terms it as a composition of Theme Park and Virtual Reality Shows. All kind of ages are covered here. In a family Young, Adults and Kids everyone will enjoy different kinds of rides. Most recommended Water World, Transformer, Dinosaurs, Mummy, Light Camera Action etc. Take time to visit. It will take around 1 days to see it. Take some light food and water inside. Also, you can enjoy food from the restaurant. It is very difficult to express the experience of Universal Studio if you do not visit.

It takes the whole day and may be the tickets are also high, but its worth going for adventurous, fun loving people, and kids. Though aged, heart patients, pregnant women can visit the amusement park, but they cannot enjoy many rides there, which are the best thing there(transformer ride, and mummy ride). They also have a water show, its kinda live movie. That is just awesome. Actors are great. I would suggest it to teens, kids (aged above 5) and young people. Go for it!

review_371051682,“Great even for a couple of oldies.”,"I have wanted to visit Universal studios in Singapore not so much for the thrill of the rides but just to see the different worlds and how they were designed so I dragged my wife along for a morning of adventure. It was an amazing experience, so much to see and do and we even went on a couple of passive rides just to say where've done so. I was extremely impressed with all the worlds, they are very colourful, well designed with plenty of action and fun with many food outlets and souvenir shops. I was disappointed that Water World was closed for maintenance as that was the world I wanted to see the most, you could see a little from the outside. We saw Charlie Chaplin, Marilyn Monroe, the Minions an Egyptian Queen. I had my photo taken along side Vin Diesel and there was a great 60's group performing as well. Its exciting for all age groups with plenty to see and do and I can certainly see why its such an popular, important attraction for Singaporeans and tourists.

review_371050083,“It's not Disneyland but still fun ”,"We avoided the Labor Day holiday rush and found the park enjoyable. There are plenty of rides for big kids and adults but very few suitable for young ones. My 4 years old daughter tried the merry go round, the flying dinosaur, the treasure hunt jeep ride and the junior roller coaster and that was it. There are certain more rides for her age and height in Disneyland. The rides are much shorter too but since we didn't wait for too long it didn't bother us too much. Dinning options are plenty and it's typical theme park food. Merchandise is rather limited too. The Donkey show is disappointing with almost no real people cast except the host. The Sesame Street show is nice but still really short and not comparable to the shows in Disneyland in terms of size of cast and production quality. It seems this park is run with much lower overhead costs. It's still fun and a must do if you are visiting Singapore. Don't forget sunscreen and hats.

I will not spoil anything for you but just advise you to reach around 9 am so that you get a headstart. Go for the transformers and mummy rides first and then the galactica ones ,first red and then blue trust me.

We rushed at first to make sure we could tick everything off but once we had done the main 4 or 5 rides we slowed down a bit. Be there at opening time as the queues are much shorter first thing. As it was a weekday the crowd wasn't so bad - our longest waits were 30-40 minutes for Canopy Flyer and Puss in Boots. Everything else was 5-15 minutes. It can get very hot waiting so drink plenty of water. Fortunately there are drinking water fountains throughout the park.

review_370399134,"“Certainly entertaining, more the younger folk, though...”","We were collected from our hotel and taken to Sentosa Island for our tour of Universal Studios. It was quite different from what I expected, although we both enjoyed our visit. Starting off with a pleasant ride through 'Madagascar' followed by a somewhat hair-raising roller-coaster barrelling through 'Puss in Boots'. Wasn't certain that I was ready for more of the same!The 'Jurassic Park' ride was excellent, with a few nervy moments (for me, anyway), but the best was the river ride. Fantastic, but expect a soaking! A long queue to go on the ride, but wow, it was worth it. A must!Then a wander through the re-created scenes from some well-known movies, a bite to eat and then onto the monorail to the mainland and the SMRT to the city centre.

review_370393959,“Lifetime Experience!!”,"My second visit to Singapore Universal Studio was as good as the first one as they keep on bringing in new themes. Firstly i would suggest you to pre book your entry pass as there are online discounts available. Also if one has to explore the place in one single day then i would suggest you to buy the express pass as it saves on waiting time. The best ride is the space mountain roller coaster both the red and blue one. Next is the terminator coaster ride which is new and amazing. If you want you can avoid the Jurassic Park as the ride there are not much of interest also when you go there you need to buy a raincoat as its a wet ride. So if possible carry your own raincoat as its very expensive in the park. Also the food is okay.

review_370012923,“Day well spent”,"If you are visiting Singapore for a couple of days and you are travelling with teenagers visit to Universal Studios is a must. There are enough attractions for each individual needs, there are high speed rides and slow ones, full with action and adrenaline driven or very calm ones, than there are live shows, movies, restaurants, shops etc.As there might be significant crowd on top attractions It is well worthwhile to invest in Universal Express or Universal Express Unlimited pass that will allow you to skip queue (on average for rides it took us 30-45 minutes waiting, for other attractions much less) and enjoy in all attractions without any delay. It will be also wise to plan your visits according to weather conditions as there are numerous attractions that are closed in case of rain/thunderstorm, although there should be enough of attractions open even in severe weather conditions. One remark, it is not allowed to bring your own food in to the amusement park, but as there is plenty of variety and at affordable prices this is not an issue.P.S. Once again, invest in Universal Express or Universal Express Unlimited Pass

review_369747026,“Fabulous!!!!”,"The USS opens at 10.00a.m local time. Advice, buy your tickets online with the express pass. At the entrance, you will find the guest services where you should show the printout, passport and credit card used for the payment. You will then be issued with the entrance ticket and the express pass ticket. The crowd builds up through the day, but if you have the express pass you just walk into the ride/attraction. The rides are awesome, specially the 4D ride at the SCi-FI City (transformers), and the Human and Cyclone (roller-coaster rides). There are plenty of food options available. Do not miss the opportunity to meet the characters and remember to take a picture with them, you could meet the characters of Madagascar, Minions, Frankenstein, Woody Wood Pecker, The Sesame Street Crew, Charlie Chaplin and many more. The souvenir shops will have all types of merchandise and there are few caricature artists from whom you could get a portrait done (costs approx SGD 50 for a couple).

That means if I want to play 8 attractions I have to spend my whole day without going somewhere else. If you see a crowd of people, I recommend you to buy a Universal Express. It is a ticket for cutting the line.On the day I visited there, the photos taken by the Universal Studios cameras in the attractions were not available to be purchased, since all the photo booths were closed.The toilets are clean and available everywhere.Souvenir shops can be found everywhere.

review_369138883,“Great Day Out”,"We were lucky enough to go on a week day when the crowds were low and the extra pass for the short lines wasn't needed. My advice is don't spend the money and check the crowd levels first and if it does get busy you can always go out and purchase this. It is a small park compared to the USA and if you arrive by 10am opening time you will be down mid afternoon if it's a week day.Take a water bottle and fill up at one of the many drinking taps as this will reduce the cost as food is expensive in the park.Great day out for the family

review_369127520,“Excellent roller coasters!!”,"Great theme park. Similar to Hollywood but with enough variation to keep it interesting and make it worth the visit. Our favorite rides were the two coasters and The Transformer ride. Unfortunately Jurassic Park was closed on our visit. Food is typical of theme park fare and usual pricing. It did get very hot and busy during our visit but we did the big rides early with no wait and then spent the afternoon on the less popular rides or at the shows in the air conditioning. The park suits all family ages with lots for everyone. Our kids are 8 and 11 and loved it. Universal is right in central Resorts World. An easy walk from all the hotels at RWS. Best tip - get there at opening and go straight for the roller coasters and Transformer rides.

review_369121653,“Great attraction for the whole family ”,"We were there at 10am and the crowds were waiting for the opening. Be prepared for Long queue at the rides namely the Transformers,the Mummies, the Lost World. Recommended to get the express ticket for additional $30 and go early to take the popular rides first. Transportation is easy to go there. Just take the MRT to HarbourFront station then take the monorail at VivoCity 4th floor straight to Sentosa. The first stop will get you to USS.

review_369023500,"“Ogre, King Julien and Transformer..”","I love universal studio singapore , been here couple of times, and everytime enjoy my day..Sharing few tips to help readers plan their day..1) Pick up Map and Show time leaflet , which are placed right at the entrance2) queue for 4d Transformer ride first , later part of the day, it gets very crowded.3) set ride/show around water world show, it's worth watching, do not skip.4) post 5.30 pm , you can go for round 2 on Transformer ride , mostly there is not much queue at that hr.5) most importantly, plan show time/ rides in advance , to avoid missing out on anything ..Tip :If its raining , make way to :Far far away 4d movie show orDonkey live or Steven Spielberg show, cause rides and meet - greet gets suspended , and these are indoor activities which are carried on..

The attractions are awesome, I am not quite expert of amusement parks, but I had a great time from the beginning till the end, and that's all that matters. Queues are long, but there's no park without them, and the most of the queues are covered with aircon, a big pro in a place like Singapore. Looking forward to go back and enjoy some more of every attraction!

review_368876717,“One of a kind”,"USS is a must-go for travelers. The park covers a large area with a water body in the middle of the park.The Battlestar Galactica must be taken. At a height of approximately 14 storeys at the highest point, the 90 second ride will definitely get you your desired adrenaline rush. However, if you're not a fan of sudden deep drops or flips, I'd suggest you don't even attempt.The transformers 4D ride was my favourite. The sound and video quality, accompanied by the movements of the 'vehicle' gave me the feeling or really being part of Transformers. There would be water sprinkler and heat waves during the ride. How to enjoy it most: Put on the glasses and never take it off during the ride, scream with the crowd.Revenge of the Mummy. It is a underground ride located at ""Ancient Egypt"" and includes rapid turns, acceleration and even falling backwards. It is a must-go for roller coaster enthusiasts.There is one water ride I strongly recommend for families. It is at ""Lost World"". The name is ""Jurassic Park Rapid Adventures"". You will get on a 9-persons raft, and flow through dinosaur habitats. However, be prepared to get extremely wet! (Bring a poncho along, some are sold there too!)The rides above are for people above 125cm, if you have young children, bring them over to the smaller rides at ""Madagascar"" and ""Far Far Away"". I won't go too in depth about those rides, but they certainly are all fun.One thing I don't really like are the prices of food. The food quality is great, however are twice the usual price in mainland Singapore. I recommend the pizza parlour inside the park, but alternatively, the Hard Rock Cafe and Chili's.Things to bring: 1) A bag. Your bag shouldn't be too big or it cannot fit into the lockers. Use a 25L haversack as an average. 2) Cash or a card. As I said, food can be quite expensive, so be prepared with enough cash, or bring a card to pay if you don't feel safe. Lockers are free for first hour and a half, but if it exceeds that time you will need to be charged. So if you take note of your time, you should be able to save some money.3) Bring comfortable walking shoes. Be prepared to walk some distance. If you're planning to take all the rides, expect walking over 2km and staying under the hot sun for a whole day. 4) Camera. A good camera is good, but it's not allowed on the roller coasters.

For our 9year old daughter, she enjoyed most of the rides. She did not fancy the roller coasters so we were glad that 90% of the rides were to her liking. It was extremely warm when we visited. They should provide a mistifier where people line up to wait for the rides. The fans were no help since it was just blowing off very warm air. We hope they can improve on this.

review_368312521,“Worth a look”,"Visited here as part of a 2 day fun pass (visit up to 20 attractions & Universal Studios) for $141.90. So it was $60 on top of the normal 1-day adult fun pass. Usual price for this attraction is $74 adult, $54 child. Open 10am - 6pm. Located near Waterfront Station.If busy the Universal Express pass is worth it - for an additional $50 you get to jump the queues which can save considerable time given the wait to some rides is often around 45 minutes. You can see what it's like first and then buy a pass inside.Most of the rides were good - my favorite was TRANSFORMERS The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle. Unfortunately the Jurassic Park Rapids was closed during our visit. Shrek 4-D adventure was quite good. Most of the rides would be fully appreciated with or by young children.

review_368217692,“All time favorite!!! ”,"Wow, this is my favorite place in Singapore.. I have visited this place about 3 times during the past 2 years and still want to go more. My favorites are the transformers ride of course, then the amazing in door roller coaster mummy returns.. Why the new ride puss in boots also amazing and how to forget the shriek 4D experience... The Jurassic park is an awesome water ride where u should allow yourself to soak. From the shows the signature ones are the water world and the Steven spillburg movie making thing.. However the sad thing is that if u go on a weekend or during school holidays the queues for the ride may be 120 minutes long. However the timing near the queues are accurate. Sometimes it feels not so good to stay in a queue for 120 minutes to enjoy a 60 seconds ride, but for me it's worth it. The shows like shriek 4D, water world and Steven spillburg doesn't have any lengthy queues as one show can accommodate big numbers. The red and the blue roller coasters are a must try and sometimes you may never wanna try roller coasters after the red ride... This is a must visit if u r I. Singapore and of course all time favorite of mine!!

This was the only place in Singapore where i saw western food joints being so affordable.The rides and the attractions are well maintained. Make sure not to visit this place during summer holidays or other school vacation time period.. Lots of families and schools with kids leading to longer ques :( But in such cases the express pass is worth investing in. Or else decide to go solo que (single line) and ask all your friends in your group to do the same. Trust me its better than waiting for an hour to go on a ride.Visit to Universal studios is a full day worth fun. If you want to see other attraction of Sentosa, you need to come back again and cannot be combined with the day you plan to visit Universal.For kids the best part of visiting Universal studios is not the rides but the photo opportunities with the characters..Those will be the best memories..

I enjoyed the Jurassic Park, Madagascar, Sesame Street, Shrek, and the show at the Waterworld. The second day at the Sentosa was all worth it. We started with the Sea aquarium, Trick Eye Museum and had lunch at KFC. After lunch, we went to see the Singapore Live Show and straight we went to Madame Tussauds.

review_367986035,“Fun Place for the Family”,"This is the first time we visited USS as a family. It was worth it for us to get VIP tickets, this made our day at USS pleasant and enjoyable. The VIP tickets allowed our kids to maximize the day by not needing to wait in line for all the rides. VIP access allowed them not only to skip the line but also allowed them to have the choice what carriage to ride, in front of the coaster or at the back, or in the middle. In some rides they were able to do it twice at one time when they wanted to. Having our own tour guide really helped a lot, we did not need to plan what to do anymore, and our kids had an instant adult companion in the rides, my wife and I got to relax and enjoy seeing the kids having the time of their life without suffering the need to accompany them in rides that were no longer enjoyable to us! The VIP tickets also came with S$25 food vouchers that we used for lunch and dinner! We opted to have the 5 hours guided tour from 10am to 3pm, I think this is a good choice since it gave us free time from 3pm to closing time to just wander around USS and repeat the rides the kids wanted to. Also at 3PM we watched the parade from a good vantage point reserved for VIP ticket holders, this area is cordoned off so that it won't be too crowded. One must see is the water world show! Just be careful where you seat if you are not ready to get wet!An additional note, Saturday's are a good time to go, although it maybe crowded but it is during this day that there is a Hollywood parade at 3pm and a firework display at 8pm.For first timers at USS, getting VIP tickets are worth it to maximize your stay and experience.

review_367097295,“If its family time in SG then it cant be completed without Universal Studios Singapore”,"My first visit was on 2010 and from there visited couple of times and below is what i suggest for my readers based on my experience. Foreigners, travellers, backpackers, couples, family or who ever is not a resident of Singapore must check USS - (Universal Studios Singapore) website event calendars before visiting. Because most of additional event like Hollywood Dream Parade or special event happens only on Fri, sat & Sun. And you know what that's when it will be over crowded too...! Still don't get disappointed as you really need to plan your day properly if visiting USS. Ensure whole day is scheduled for USS and be early even before they open some where like be present by 10am. Relax and make sure you are the last person to walk out until they close cause you have to cover all attractions inside. Based on my experience as soon as they open USS rush to Transformers ride first cause queue will be crazy. Next go to Mummy ride then Jurassic Park. For Jurassic park if you don't want to get wet try to get a $2 raincoat some where in health & glow or Watson's shop. Cause it's cheaper outside and expensive inside. Then try to cover water world live action - sure this one not to be missed especially within time. After that come back to lights, camera & action. Then on go towards Far Far away, from here you may go in order to one by one to cover all attractions. As you follow in order you will be again back to entrance from there ensure you cover all other missing rides. Because after opening USS you were rushing to transformers...! Don't worry by that time as attractions you will be missing as you head towards transformers cause you will be covering them later.If any of the order is missed believe me you wont be able to cover USS completely and for sure will be disappointed as you missed some rides. Atlast you cannot complete your Singapore Trip without USS. Am sure this will help you a lot. Happy travelling ...!

My personal favorite is the mummy themed one. If you are not a big fan of roller coasters, you can also come here and take photos with your favorite movie characters and watch other shows and performances. The staff at the photo booths are really nice. They always help you to take photos with your own phones and give you various ideas of poses. I had a wonderful day with my friend. You can get cheaper tickets at certain travel agencies.

review_366857300,“Overcrowded and crazy queue”,"I went on thursday which is weekday on april which is not holiday season but this place is crazy CROWDED. I wait for 45 minutes for transformer rides and it's only less than 5 minutes to enjoy the game. seriously, it's not worthy waiting. the Jurassic Park ride were closed because it's repaired and the Battle of Galatica rides is closed at 5 pm for cyclone side. I suggest to bring a lot of drink cause the weather is hell HOT and the price for drinks is too expensive. if you want to eat, I also suggest to have your meals before or after entering USS which is in Vivo City. They had good food with good price. since the price for food at theme park always unreasonable.If you need to play in here, you must have a lot of patience because the queue is always there in every rides that available.

I know things will be expensive & that unfortunate things like breakdowns or things like the weather happens. I also don't rush, because I know things like ques are a thing. However, the day I went, only one ride was down. I had a fun time going on all the other rides though. The best one was the Transformers The Ride. It was just fantastic & so much fun for all ages. I would recommend going here only if you have all day & don't mind spending money, pretty much just like any other theme park.

review_366720996,“Great day out”,"We have two teenage boys and decided, at the last minute, to give them a surprise treat and take them to Universal Studios. We've been all but one of the Disney theme parks in the world as well as the local ones on the Gold Coast. Although Universal Studios isn't too dissimilar to the other theme parks, we felt that it had something the others didn't. The rides were great and my thrill-seeker sons and husband really loved the Battle Star Galactica ride and I enjoyed the ones I was game to go on. I was slightly annoyed that I didn't have my passport with me as this was needed for the rock climbing attraction. This should be advertised somewhere (and if it is, should be advertised more clearly). The food was great value and good portions - way better value than any other theme park I've been to. If you've finished your sightseeing and want a fun day out with the family, I'd highly recommend Universal Studios. We were lucky to be there on a Friday, so the queues weren't too long and rarely waited more than 10 minutes.

review_366630133,“Really not worth the hyoe”,"We went on a weekday as suggested in other reviews. The place was still crazily overcrowded and any of the outdoor rides were closed for a good few hours due to lightning warnings.Most of the rides were lame and certainly not worth the queuing time. However, we did enjoy the Puss in Boots mini roller coaster- our 3 year-old son really enjoyed this. Also the Jurassic Park Rapids ride is great fun.I would strongly suggest bringing plenty of drinks as the day will be long and humid and the drinks, like everything else here, are ridiculously expensive. Most of the staff look harassed and bored and quite unhelpful with directions to particular things in the park. The highlight was the Steven Spielberg movie experience but like all the rides here it did not last long enough to properly enjoy.Honestly, if you don't go, you aren't missing much.

review_366539218,“Universal Studios - reclaim your childhood fun”,"In April we visited Singapore for a week - What an amazing city. High on our list of to do was Universal Studios. The weather was hot so a water bottle and hat is a must - if you can get away without a bag to carry around do this or you will be packing belongings in lockers or leaving them on exit counters / I carried a small zip up bag with a string handle about 10cm by 8 cm and simply wore it around my neck and tucked it into the front of my pants - it contained my mobile phone and my money and my train card - the MRT card that you buy at the railway station and load money on. To get to Universal Studios we caught the train to Harbourside then a monorail trip to Universal. We also paid an extra $50 for express passes so that we did not have to wait in queues - these ended up being amazing as we did not have to wait in the heat at any time. We headed off straight to the transformers ride - loved it - then Human vs Cyclon an amazing roller coaster - wow!!!! Revenge of the Mummy is not to be missed and Jurassic Park Rapids ride also even if just to cool you down. Then you will probably want to do these again a few times if you are an adrenalin junkie !!! Many more nice rides and theatres and look out for Fiona and Shrek they are sure to want to give you a cuddle in the land of Far Far Away. Lunch at an American Diner or any of the food outlets and street dancing and singing - so so much to do. Afterwards as you head out it is only a short walk to an amazing aquarium that shouldn't be missed - have fun

review_366480631,"“Only a few great rides, Water world show is a must see.”","Best advice i can offer it to visit this place on a weekday and preferably off season. I was excited to visit Universal studios after many recommendations however the thing that scared me the most was the long wait times for rides, luckily we never had to wait more then 10minutes for a ride! we arrived at 10am for open, the one downside i have is no one tells you if you have a fun pass you need to collect a ticket first then line up. So many people waited for so long only to have to re join the lines after getting a ticket. not one staff member said anything or any sign's. We were lucky enough to go on all four major rides in under an hour. The transformers ride is pretty cool , i suggest try getting a seat at the front as it is much better for effects. The Human and cyclone roller coaster were great, however the Human one was pretty boring. Other then those and the Mummys revenge and Jurassic river ride theres not much more in the way of exciting rides. The water world show was amazing, sit up the front to get soaked on a hot day. The crew were fun and got the crowd involved. The effects were really great to see, i highly recommend going.

Difference is that the themes here are of universal movies instead of Disney. Going during CNY was an issue as all rides were over crowded and waiting times ranged into hours. Though these adventure rides were similar to one's in disneyland. The different part is there are a lot of live shows and a special effects show which was actually very good.

The 45 min queue for the Transformers ride was air conditioned and, surprisingly, entertaining. The ride itself was fantastic. Our last stop for the day was Ancient Egypt, the ride was thrilling and tge special effects took us straight into Tomb Raider. Our boys cleared the height restrictions easily but even when we climbed into the ride there was nothing to warn us that this was a hectic rollercoaster....more thrilling than the outdoor ones because of the special effects. A little more than the regular health warnings would have been good. And, the food at Jurassic world is terrible. Throughout the park food, water and other drinks are seriously overpriced. Otherwise, a great day out.

At least their Elmo ride was super cute. If you are on a budget, pack your own lunch.

review_365964533,“Great time at Universal Studio”,"We went with out two children 10 and 6 and a day was not enough at the universal Studio. In spite of going on a Tuesday, we ended up spending about an hour in the queue for most of the rides. It reduces the time drastically when we go as a single rider. Better to have two days to cover everything. Transformer and Mummy are the two best rides. Though I went in for Transformer, I didn't have courage to go in the Mummy ride, it being more like an advanced roller coaster. We had a great vegetarian meal at the Ancient Egypt restaurant. Don't be fooled by looking at the queue outside Transformer. There are rooms and rooms before we actually get to do the ride and it might easily take an hour to get to the ride.

review_365962679,“Cyclone & Human Rides are a must”,"Universal Studio is one of the best amusement parks based on a theme of Hollywood movies. We were able to cover most of the park as we visited during a weekday! So here is what I did -1. Hollywood street - is nothing much to do, rather it is a place to shop/eat/click pictures. There is a store called the universal studio store where you get souvenirs of all the themes based in the USS.2. New York - Again a lot of restos and well designed walls to give it a New York look. My favorite part was the 'Lights Camera Action' and the 'Sesame Street Spaghetti'.There were also street shows which I couldn't make in time. I will not give away the details to avoid spoilers :)3. Sci-Fi - The bestest part was the Cyclone & Human Ride in the battlestar gallactica, these are roller coaster rides gives you an amazing head rush! Transformers is the second best in the whole USS. These two rides take your energy to a whole new level.4. The Revenge of Mummy - The third best part of the USS. A must do for all of you.5. The Lost World - Canopy, Rapid Adventure are the one's I would suggest here.6. Far Far Away - A beautiful Disneyland-like set. Very nicely designed buildings, feels like you are in a fairy tale. Shrek Movie is a must. Enchanted ride is also suggested.7. Madagascar - Nothing great about it. Crate ride gives you a nice ride of Madagascar island. Maybe a must do for Madagascar fans.We had food in China Bistro in the Hollywood street, decent food. Great atmosphere overall. Very bright and vibrant colours all over the place. Good luck with the queues. :)Tip: They almost always display a waiting time for all the rides, do not just get in the queue at once. Take a tour of the whole of USS, complete the must do ones if they have <15min wait time first. During the second round complete all the remaining must do's. If time permits take a third round and complete the ok-ok ones!

review_365900378,“Don't Leave Singapore Before Visiting Universal Studios”,"My husband and l were on a 4 night stay in Singapore over the Easter break. On our must see list was Universal Studios, Sentosa Island. Firstly many tour buses will get you there, we used the Duck & Hippo Group (see other review). I didn't time it but seemed like a 15 minute (give or take) ride to get there from the departure stop (Suntec City) which is one block from Raffles Hotel with plenty to see on the way. On arrival all transport enters through the underground drop off carpark with escalators to take you up to the central area with eateries, museums and yes Universal studios.Several packages are available to suit your needs depending on what sort of experience you want. We just bought general admission tickets at $74 SGD per person for a day pass which at todays rate would be $70 AU. There are several ticket booths at entrance but don't be dismayed by the long lines as they move very quickly with lots of willing staff to help guide you through. I noticed stroller hire was available as well. Before you go in grab a studio guide with map of layout and info which are available inside the gate as well. Very easy to walk around again with plenty of staff to assist. The themed areas consist of Madagascar, Far Far Away, The Lost World, Ancient Egypt, Sci-Fi City, New York & Hollywood. Now we didn't go on all the rides but a big hint if you go on the Rapids Adventure at Jurassic Park we waited in line for 1.5 hours yes 1.5 hours, no seats. It's set up like a cattle shed just lines and lines of people waiting. Go on this ride as soon as you arrive as the day goes on it gets longer and longer. WaterWorld was closed for renovations which was disappointing but Aussies should be used to that with our Qld parks. I just feel personally if people pay full price for the whole experience then thats exactly what they should get. I know maintenance works have to be done sometime but an incentive would have been nice upon purchasing tickets say a free snack & drink for example to compensate.Also be aware if your whole family are going on the same ride many rides do require you to put all your belongings in a locker before boarding so do this upon arrival taking only your money, phone that can be put in pockets securely. Lockers start at about $4.00 SGD and that gives you about 3 hours if l recall. They are all individual code access so no keys and are located at many ride entrances. If you go over your time it will simply ask you to pay the difference before disengaging the locker. Also chances are you may get drenched or not at all on this ride hence locking up bags but raincoats are available if you decide to take your belongings with you, also $4.00 SGD.One experience you should not miss is what it's like on a movie set with lighting, props and special effects show, only about 30 minutes but really fascinating. We did not eat inside Universal but chose The Hard Rock Cafe instead. There seemed to be an abundance of eateries to choose from though. Upon leaving Universal we decided to take the Singapore Cable Car back over to the mainland and catch a bus from there but upon reaching the ticketbooth we were misdirected not once but 3 times and basically got sent walking back and forth until we gave up( another review, no fault of universal) and jumped on the MRT. Communication breakdown to blame.Overall don't leave Singapore without spending the day at Sentosa Island, you won't be disappointed worth every cent. Happy travels.

review_365876210,“Get the lovely Disney feeling”,"The only negative thing I would say about the Universal Studios in Singapore is that the music in the park is too loud and it is everywhere. Other than that it is a wonderful park with lots of fun rides for both small children and teenagers, lovely streets, nice cafes and of course the possibility of getting to meet and greet Disney characters.If you can afford it buy the Universal Express pass which lets you pass the queue on many attractions, or else most of your time spent in the Universal studios will be in a queue.

review_365638099,“Hot but fun!”,"Scorching heat on Sentosa Island at Universal Studios in April but still had so much fun. Several of the attractions are cool inside so that helps. Transformers the Ride, the Battle Star Galactica roller coasters (Human & Cylons), and the Shrek 4D were highlights for us. Also the movie set hurricane experience hosted by Steven Spielberg was quite fun. Plenty of rides (and most are family friendly), plenty of shows, food and snacks everywhere (including a Starbucks near the entrance), and an overabundance of souvenirs & memorabilia to buy.

It is full of adventure, fun and needs lot of adrenaline.Wait sometimes can be irritating, but u can always take the Express pass and jump the queue.Express pass can be bought inside at 50SGD per pax, which is definitely quite a cost to add on. But worth the penny if u interested to enjoy full.Keep your camera / selfie sticks handy. There are endless avenues to go click click click click..Best attraction is transformers.....

Hint: Upgrade to the Universal Express pass for an extra $50 per person. It will let you bypass the normal queues (between 45-90mins) and hop onto the ride in 5-10mins! Takes away the frustration and maximizes the experience.

review_365555527,“GOOD FAMILY DAY OUT”,"This was our 3rd or 4th time in USS. There has been no much changes since our last visit.. the show and rides etc are same. We went during Easter, so they had Egg deco everywhere and they had spl eggravagant show at additional S$10.00 per person on top of the USS tickets which i feel was not really worth it the additional cost.I feel they do need to keep adding new shows and new rides from time to time. The Q are long as usual and if you are ready to spend additional $50.00 for express pass, then will suggest u to do it as u can save lot of time esp in the rides like Mummy and transformer where the waiting time can easily be 1.30 hrs.On our visit day, we were lucky as in the morning it was pouring so the crowd was less so we managed to do many rides in 15-30 min waiting time but during the noon, it was packed again and then again we were back to 40-90 min waiting time. Try going on the rainy day..ofcourse u will get wet but atleast u can njoy the rides without waiting.The drinks / food are quiet expensive in the park, so be prepared accordingly. For reference small coke / can is $ 3.50 and big glass is 4.5$ , food set is approx $11.50.For water carry your own bottle and fill in..as there has drinking water in many places.My kids enjoys the rides so i guess we will surely get to visit again if we are in SIN.. I hope there will be more changes once we visit them again..

Only disappointment was the lack of photos when coming out of rides as we love to see our crazy faces, and have the option of purchasing the pictures. Transformers was our favourite ride which was so very unexpected. And the express pass was the most worthwhile purchase as we didnt have to wait in the hour long lines. When we were there, some outdoor rides were suspended for about 30 minutes because of lightening, however the storm didnt come. But I saw many people extremely disappointed as they had waited an hour to get on the ride only to get to the front and have it cancelled. Whereas we only had a 5 minute wait and at times not even that. They whole day was awesome.

The very first 4D Transformers ride is at the Universal Studios Singapore and it is simply exhilarating..! And the Mummy Roller Coaster is just unbeatable..! Went THRICE on the Mummy Roller Coaster and I still haven't had enough..! But the best part about all the rides are the queue lines. Regardless of the genre of the characters involved in the ride, every queue line will guide you through a series of events which gives you a good background on what the ride is about. Every ride is linked to a story, which is just fantastic. And to top that, what brilliant execution by the staff..! Would love to go again!!

New York City and parade. Thematic restaurants and buildings were well decorated to bring out the vintage characters and places to life.I was really amazed on the thematic entertainments and really enjoyed a lot . Evening at 3 30 PM i witnessed the spectacular New York City Parade , with cartoons characters, Madonna, Chaplin ,  and vintage caracheters and artists dancing and performing on streets. Hollywood Stunts were performed in the amphitheater with real explosions and stunts fires and boats stromig inside water with real movie FX. The Jurasic park Discovery was amazing and thrilling with round about water coaster  floating and waters splashing.It was eyes captivating and there was variety of shows running in each theaters and at the evening got relaxed on the waterfront lake at 8 PM there was a spectacular fireworks in the lake and i watched it relaxing on the pavements.After finishing  my Universal Studio day out i came out and headed to Crane Dance show near the cause way front which is also spectacular with two cranes dancing with splashing fountain waters and light effects.Crane dance show is free anyone can sit on the gallery and see and enjoy the show.

From hollywood zone to jurassic, from the mummy zone to madagascar zone. The place is not too big as the other Universal Studios, but 1 day is quite enough to play the rides.The most challenging ridea in here are the Mummy Indoor Rollcoaster and their dual ""Battlestar Galactica"" outdoor rollercoaster, Human and Cylone. Even though it looks very scary for some people, but I am very recommend you to try this. After feel the experience, I am not become scarrier but wanting to try again the rides. But remember, to try these, you need to use the free locker at the side of rides.For kids, the theme park also provide kids related attractions. From Minions to Sesame Street until the Madagascar Rides. You also can find easily thematic souvenir shop and collectible item at each stores.If you loves to have a challenging and entertaining attraction in Singapore, this can be a good recommendation for friends or family trip.

Children can enjoy far far away (Shrek) and other cartoon characters, while the adults can enjoy Mummy returns and jurassic park. One of the must do rides is the TRANSFORMERS ride. do'nt forget to do it as it might seem to be difficult from outside. If you want to enjoy the full park thoroughly, you should take a 2-day pass as 1 day is just not enough !

review_365005133,"“Avoid weekends, bags, bring iced bottle!”","It's easy enough on foot to get around the park. Best rides IMO: Transformers, Mummy, the roller coaster. You'll have to use the lockers to keep your things between rides or walk a giant round back if you rent one locker for the whole day (cheaper than renting one at every ride). I suggest pants with zippered pockets so at least you have cash for food/drink & handphone for photos without repeated walking. The lines took up a lot of time so do avoid weekends or you won't finish the park.Going back, I'd have packed a frozen bottle of water - so as the ice melts you get a cold drink and you can use the bottle to cool your neck as you get so hot and sweaty especially at the Waterworld show - also a highlight of the park. You may get a little wet at the Jurassic Park ride but that was so mild I'd rather have skipped the long queue and given it a miss. Nothing much to mention in terms of food. I'd rather have burgers in Hard Rock cafe outside the Studios, if you can last the day. Worth it if you bring the kids as I felt half the rides were child-oriented. A tall 12-year-old would be able to enjoy both worlds. Maybe a VIP pass would have made a better experience...

Firstly the noise from the speakers around the park is set to the highest volume so you can't hear the person next to you. Also the sound on the rides is the same volume if not louder and is so distorted that you can't hear it. This was the case on the puss and boots ride and even the Sesame Street spaghetti ride - our 4 year old actually asked to leave the park because it was so loud. This coupled with the heat and very little shelter unless you wanted to pay for extortionately priced food made for a very uncomfortable expensive and disappointing day.

There are also shopping and dining options at various areas in the park.I went to Universal Studios with much expectation like real sets as in Universal Studios LA, but on visiting I realized that this place is only rides.

It was during Queensland school holidays just after Easter so was busy but no where near as busy as it could have been judging by the queueing barriers. We were disappointed to not go on the Jurassic Park ride but we just refused to wait 100 minutes in a line. If you can afford it, definitely worth the express pass in busy times, although this is VERY frustrating when you don't have one and watch so many people going straight to the front of the queue. The times stated at the beginning of each ride line are not always accurate, we waited an hour for a ride that had said 20 mins and only waited 20 mins for a ride that said 50?

All the popular rides were more than an hour of wait, some two. So we decided to get the express pass. Totally worth the money. You can use it for almost all rides, unlike most of the other parks that restrict only a few rides. We watched the parade in the afternoon. It's not good. Don't waste your time unless you want to sit for a bit. And if you will have your lunch anyways, sit at the restaurants where they have outdoor seats - front seats to see the parade. We didn't do that and it's dumb. We first sat on the side of the street thinking we would be the first row. When the parade started, everyone all the sudden stood in front of us to watch. Totally didn't understand why. So we had to do the same to see anything if we would. Hundreds of people squeezing each other in a hot sweating day.... Not very enjoyable. And the parade was not good at all.

review_364315349,“Live up to the expectation as signature attraction of Singapore.”,"We visited USS on 2/4/2016. The general experience is pleasant, given needed to mention that one may have to tolerate the frustration of queuing and waiting, and the competition with filthy rich fellow holiday goers who hold the express pass.We went on a non-holiday weekend, with the park operating from 10am till 9.00pm, and the operating hours is more than enough for us to play around the whole park. To our surprise, all rides are fairly easily available with almost no queue after 7pm. Hence, we got chances of repeating few good rides like Mummy revenge(twice, no queue), Jurassic park rapid adventure(twice, no queue), Transformer(single rider lane 3 times, no queue) and even Battlestar Galatica(5 minutes queue for Human side). Cylon ride is forever long queue. The most fascinating ride in the park is definitely Battlestar Galatica: Cylon. This is the best roller coaster so far in my travel log. Transformer: The Ride is very impressive as well, and I won't mention any spoiler. Just go try those 2 rides yourself, as these 2 are really true signature ride of USS. Food is quite alright, typically expensive for in-park dining but nothing special worth mentioning.In summary, definitely worth our visit. I would recommend this place to people of all ages, but need to be in good health.

review_364294708,“Must visit for little and big kids alike.”,"Writing this review after my second visit to USS. The first was in 2012, so I was excited to see any changes that might have occured!We took the MRT to Vivo City and enjoyed the walk along the Sentosa Boardwalk to get in. Lucky for us we chose a day that was slightly overcast and a few showers were forecast- which I think scared a lot of the locals away! We probaby got rained on once or twice but it was just a sprinkle, and we welcomed the cooling mist after spending a day in the Singaporean humidity! We were going to buy ourselves express passes at the gate to skip the queues- but we didnt need to! We got on most of our rides within 10 minutes waiting. The longest wait was the Human Vs Cylon rollercoaster which took more than an hour- but we were happy to wait, thinking of the money we saved from not buying the express pass! This ride was VERY FAST! It travelled at high speeds but was over quite quickly. My favourite of the many worlds is for sure Far Far Away, it seems the best thought out and is very magical- plus it has the BEST soundtrack when walking around/ waiting for amusements. MUST DO'S- THE TRANSFORMERS RIDE. I loved it the first time and loved it even more this time! I would have even rode it straight away afterwards but the line was a little long and I wanted to explore the rest of the park with my friends who had never been before- JURASSIC PARK RIDE. This is a great water raft ride and definitely a drawcard! Explore Jurassic Park on an innocent boat ride... but watch out, recent weather conditions means something has gone wrong with the dinosaurs....WATER WORLD SHOW. This show is a face paced, full of effects and stunts outdoor show with fire, water, loud music and boat tricks. Not to be missed! I've heard a rumour they're thinking of retiring this show so definitely go while you have the chance!MELS DINNER. There are plenty of themed eateries throughout the park which offer similar food, but I definitely find my favourite to be Mel's Dinner. A 50's themed diner with classic cars out the front and a stage for The Dinettes and The Cruisers to sing Acapella Pop Songs- such a blast and a free performance! SUNSCREEN. A lot of the attractions are water based or involve water, so make sure you re-apply your sunscreen throughout the day. FIREWORKS. The fireworks show at nightime was absolutely lovely, so if you can- stay the whole day and watch the Fireworks at night over the lake Because we bought our tickets with Mastercard we got 10% off and also got some ridiculous and oversized Shrek waterbottles in Far Far Away! It was great :)Although I've been twice I've still never managed to get photos with the Shrek characters! The slip of paper you get as you enter which tells you when the characters are around for meet and greets seemed to have failed me this visit, because Shrek and Fiona weren't at Shreks Swamp when the piece of paper said so. Not a big deal... I guess I'll just have to come back ;) Not much had changed since my last visit, Far Far Away had expanded for some new Puss in Boots themed attractions which were fun, Seasame Street took over the Hollywood strip and The Minion Mart was a new addition. However I definitely think I loved it more after this visit, and I still haven't done ALL the rides!

review_364274518,“A must go place if you are in sinagppore...”,"A few tips if you are going to universal studios ...- take a cab and get yourself dropped if you are staying nearby and on your way back the monorail will take you back to vivo city free of charge. - if you are looking at a place to eat street food at a cheap price , there is a food court opposite harbor-front on the other side of the road. there is one exit from the harbor front which connects you directly to the that food court.- food inside Universal studios is a bit expensive. there is one food court each for each of those attraction segments. ex: if you are ancient Egypt the food you get are related to same.. - transformers is a ride you should not miss / we loved he mummy ride as well...

Some good rides for younger kids are "" the Madagascar: a crate adventure"" & ""treasure hunters "" . One of the rides I went on which was quite scary was the "" TRANSFORMERS The ride: The ultimate 3D battle"" I wish there had of been more of a discription about what to expect as it wasn't suitable for children. But over all I had a really good time. But also in the shops everything was very expensive. But it was still a great experience.

review_364049893,“A good amusement park day”,"Universal Studios Singapore is small by most amusement park standards. This was my 5th visit since it opened. Like most things done by the Genting organization, it was well built but is not being well maintained. At opening, I thought this version of Jurassic Park was the best of all the Universal parks. Now sadly the highlight animatronics are broken. The T-Rex that is supposed to be the big scare just hangs droopy headed and not moving while the roaring soundtrack plays on. This is the Genting way. Build it nice...never touch it again. It is pervasive through the entire Resorts World Complex.Back to the park itself...as it is the only real amusement park in Singapore, it is a good day out. There is an assortment of attractions for all ages. START LEFT! The mildest attractions are to the left and build as you work your way around the park. If you start to the right, the big thrills will be over with early and the rest of the day a continual let down on excitement as you work your way to less and less exciting attractions. Like most parks, food and gifts are overpriced...no surprises there. Food quality is a bit lacking here as compared to other Universal parks. This one does have the best version of the Mummy. I would not recommend staying on the island. It is too removed from everything. Stay in Singapore and come out to the island for your Universal Day. There really is not much other reason to be at Sentosa Island. I have posted other reviews of my hotel stay in the resort as well as the other attractions visited.

review_364029695,“Good day out”,"Good family day out. Queues weren't too bad with the longest wait about nearly 90 mins however others were ok. By staying later, the park started to empty by about 5pm and the long queues were only a few minutes waiting. Worth arriving a bit later and staying to closing time. Some high speed rides require all items to be put into a locker. The first 45 mins is free but you have to pay after that and with some waiting times quite long - watch out. Probably worth paying for fast track tickets. Food prices were ok when comparing with other theme parks. We got a giant hotdog (18 inch) & fries for about $18 which was large enough for two people. By paying with Mastercard at the information booth located behind the ticket booths we received 10% discount and a voucher for free Shrek drink bottles.

review_363922022,“Mr Hassan ”,"Went there for the day. Reasonably priced entry if you purchase tickets online. Lot's of areas closed off to public, which they don't mention to customers on website. Really expensive snacks at food outlets, even for UK citizens. Example, 5 Singapore dollars for a 300ml plastic cup of blue slush ice. Usually 50p from my local ice cream van at a UK Park. Park map gives the impression of an enormous piece of land, the whole Park is spread over. I did a full lap with my family in 15mins. Many things are charged for in addition to park entry fees. They deliberately make you hire lockers to store your pocket contents, watches and baggage etc, in the hope that you overshoot your free 85 minutes rental period and then 4 Singapore dollars an hour kicks in, accrued in one hour increments. This isn't very had to achieve when you experience that average queue is just under 2houes long.

review_363545728,“Good but inefficient loading and unloading that eats into your fun”,"We went as a family with our child (10). This park is not the same as what is in California/Florida. This park is very much smaller and can be covered in half a day if you plan your rides and have the appropriate tickets/passes. We got tickets to Universal as a part of 2 day fun pass to Sentosa. We reached Sentosa at 9:45AM and the park opens at 10:00AM. We did get our UNLIMITED rides passes in the front gate guest services. If you are planning to be there for only half a day, I highly recommend this unlimited rides pass. This pass/hand tag, will allow you to skip the long lines and jump in front of the line in addition to riding any number of times. This pass is similar to Disney's fastpass except with no time slot. Please keep in mind that unlimited pass is not valid on 4 rides. I remember one of them was treasure hunt where you sit in a jeep and go for a short ride around a pre-defined path (boring! boring!). The other one is just a rock climbing activity which we skipped anyways. The other ride Canopy Flyer in the Lost World section/area. The lines for those were anyways shorter. The last one is magic potion spin which is a wheel for kids so we skipped that as well. Rides are great and my kid had lots of fun riding the coasters and other ones. They do suspend outdoor rides in the event of thunderstorms etc. However, it seemed temporary and they are opened when it is safe to do so.I had to rate this as an average only due to the fact that the staffs are not trained to load and unload. Loading an unloading is nowhere close to Disney for sure. When you see a ride with wait time 30 mins, it is the same as seeing a ride in Disney with wait time 10mins. Definetly staffs are not trained in loading and unloading which takes lot of time which eats into your day. If the park is crowded I highly recommend the unlimited pass ($50/person). You may end up going in each of the rides atleast 2 times considering the inefficient loading and unloading.Food inside is expensive but you are left with no option. There were many places that had water fountains to fill up the water bottles.

My favourite ride was the transformer which is and indoor ride that has multiple sound and light distractions to keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Food is a little expensive but no more than you expect to pay at a major tourist attraction in a large city. If you are looking for a fun day out there are plenty of different rides that cater for all age groups the 4D Shrek ride was a bit of fun and one I am sure all the younger kids would really enjoy.

review_362982865,“Great park with lots to offer for rides but food is nothing special”,"We were a little concerned that the park was going to be tiny and not have a whole lot to offer an adult couple but we were really impressed with what they have. It cost about $75 Singapore dollars to go which is about the same Canadian which seemed pretty reasonable. Some rides had major waits up to an hour or two and we were there during low season. The one thing that really annoyed me was the Jurassic rapid adventure ride they don't provide lockers like they do many of the other rides even tho they advertise that your stuff will certainly get wet. So whatever we decided to get a locker we rented for an hour because the wait time was 35 minutes. While waiting the time kept going up and up then after waiting probably close to an hour we decided to do the single rider line. Once we got back to our locker we see that we went over the time and we owed money. It just seemed like and absolute money grab to me. Other than that the rides were all good but the food is all fried and nothing great.

review_362667315,“Nice and loud”,"The reason why I think Universal Studios in SG are average and not more are basically: a. the place is not very big, b. the place is sometimes too loud. Ok I can see the objection: cannot go to some amusement park and pretend the peace of the Austrian Alps. True, but the matter is the music all over the park (commercial music, not something dedicated to Universal movies or themes) is set up quite loud and there is nowhere to find a quite oasis, for example when your small kid finally sleeps down, exhausted. Pair it with the heat, which in SG is a constant, and you'll find why I found it unpleasurable. When they have some show on the road the music of the show mixes with the loudspeakers of other areas... This said, we did not try all the attractions, kid being too small sometimes, but we found some of them quite good, Transformers above all of them. The place can be visited in half a day to one day, depends of how intensive you go around, and I found it to be comparatively less attractive then, for example, Disneyland which we visited in Anaheim and Orlando. Food offering around the park is ok, whereas it is mostly junk food or fried things. I found the website to buy the tickets not very functional and particularly the mechanism to purchase the express passes (or how they name them) felt to me more on a rubbery base than on a fair base. ""Rubbery"" might sound a too strong word but that is how I felt it. The fact is on their website the price for Express Pass is indicated to be SGD 30,00. Actually this is not true as it is increased on a base of demand/offer (or supposed so) criterium. So when I logged on the website the price for Express Pass was indicated as SGD 50,00. I looked around to understand why this difference but could not find any explanation. Finally, not wanting to loose too much time I effected the reservation and when I wanted to pay for some reason the card payment did not go through. When I finally logged in again the price was raised to SGD 70,00!!!. So, all in over we had to pay for the Express pass SGD 80,00 more (160 if you consider the price they put on the website) and I felt about being treated very unfairly, if I do not want to use the term robbed anymore. There was also an Easter Egg Chase event which was not explained in detail (it was about SEEING some eater egg around the park) so I ended up to buy 4 tickets for it when only one would have been necessary (another 30 SGD shelled out for mostly nothing). Paid just for the kid, if it was for me I would have avoided to go, this is why it is so bad: they rely on the emotional blackmail most of us bring a kid there and you do not want to explain you do not want to go because a few bucks. Still, greedy. Total damage for our party of four, 596 SGD, in my opinion totally not worth (if not for the kid). Okay, you can avoid the Express pass (which costed basically the same amount of money of the entry ticket) but I was in holiday, and not wishing to stand hours in queue in the heat with a 4 years kid for any attraction (still waited enough for some of them). Beware: Express pass was LIMITED to one entry per attraction, unlimited would have cost more. Still, inexplicably, some attraction do NOT have any express pass lane so so that you simply pay and wait. My feeling how this park is managed: with little respect for customers, but great for own bank account. Would return? Nope.

review_362495683,“Awesome ”,"Universal Studios Is part of the santosa island.The rides are divided in 4 categories -Sci - Fi city - this segment has 2 major attraction Transformers and battle star roller coaster.The transformer rise was an awesome experience with 7D effects.Ancient Egypt -The main ride here is the Revenge of the Mummy - this is a high speed roller coaster ride and is an excellent experience.Treasure Hunters - is a slow jeep track ride which takes you through ancient Egypt landscapesThe lost world -Jurassic park rapid adventure is a rapid river ride and has a surprise element at the climax, it's must experiencing Canopy Flyer is a sky ride and gives you the hawk eye view of the complete park. Amazing one.Far Far Away-This is also a very good section.-Puss in boots is a coaster ride with twists and turns and is awesome-shriek 4 D is also an amazing theatre experience.Hollywood -Light camera action is a good show which tells u how the special effects Ar created in the movie - must watch

review_362411655,“Brings back the child in you!”,"I went here for a trip with my college friends before graduation.You must be prepared for the humid weather. It was one of the most amazing experiences that I've had with an amusement park. It was so funny because we went for ""Revenge of the Mummy"" and we thought that it was a horror house or a horror train like the ones here in Philippines. While entering, all of my friends were shouting thinking that machine operated mummies were there to scare us, only to find out that it was a high speed roller coaster! It was the best experience ever because I am usually afraid to ride any roller coaster ride here. It was my first time and definitely not the last time.Another must-try is the ""Transformers"" ride, we really felt that we were part of the movie. All of the other rides and amusement are gonna bring back the child in you! I am excited for another visit here this coming July!

review_362252159,“A day in Universal Studio Singapore”,"That day was initially intended to explore the famous Universal Studios. Because of my epic fail attempt going to Universal Studio during my last trip, this time it really excite me. At a very expensive ticket price at 79SGD with ride all you can and 1free meal, we need to get early at USS and blame our long list of things we want to achieve with this single trip for a limited time to explore the entire Universal Studios. It has lot of thrilling rides. We prioritized the famous rides recommended by friend who had been there – all of us clueless of what’s inside each ride but one thing I know is the Galactica. But unfortunately as we entered the USS, that ride was under maintenance and will open by July (so sad!) and I think the sky know that were sad and it rained that day! Awesome! Among the rides we tried, I personally think the Transformers and The Mummy were the most awesome! Apart from trying the rides, we took the time to just walk around and swung our way around Far Far Away castle and meet my prince, Shrek. Too bad there were very few characters in costume roaming that time. Jurrasic Park that makes my clothes and hair get wet. We got the chance to watch a live sea war, a death-defying stunt show at the Water World. I really did enjoyed the few rides we had and appreciated the creativity and effort to recreate the movie set from each of the ride entrance to the ride itself. After of all the rides, we get our free food from our voucher in one of the fast food at the Far Far Away Castle.

review_362144800,“Great experience for first time”,"First time at any USS. We went on a Friday and we felt there was a lot of people. We arrived later than we planned around 11.30am so the lines were fairly long already. The average wait was around 20 minutes because we made use of the single riders line. I highly recommend this. Most of the time my husband and I could sit close to each other and it was definitely worth not having to wait in some cases for up to 200 minutes! Free lockers are available for limited time outside certain rides so make the most If them.For lunch we went out to the hawker food centre which had cheaper food than inside USS. You can leave and go back inside on the same day. All up we spent about 6 hours there and this included going on all of the adult rides except the Human battleship galactica one.

The area is huge so even with an entire day pass, you won't have enough time to go through everything (especially if you want to go to the aquarium next door as well). The rides were really fun and the lines weren't that long either. There were lots of shops for souvenirs so if you feel like resting for a while, you can just browse inside the cool, air-conditioned stores. There were also a lot of mascots that you can take pictures with. So if you're on a budget and you can't go all the way to Hong Kong Disneyland for a holiday, try heading over to USS with you family for a fun-filled day!

review_361665166,“Great”,"USS is a wonderful day activity to Ve included in your Singapore itinerary.The park is divided into various sections and themes.The must visit rides are revenge of the mummy, human vs robot, transformers 3d, jurrasic park adventure. Rest of the rides are meant mainly for kids.The shows lights, camera, action-steven Spielberg, Shrek are a must visit. (Waterworld was under maintenance when we visited)The need to make time for character meet and greet as lines close up really fast.Its advisable to get a bottle of your own as it gets very hot and humid throughout the day. There are lot of fountains to refill your water from. Singapore water is extremely safe.If you need to cover most of the rides opt for single rider wherever possible as we get to fill an empty spot on a ride and complete the same within 5 minutes instead of standing in queue for 40 minutes.You can cover the entire park in a day.

review_361642986,“Go on a weekday to avoid queues”,"It's worth going to a universal studio once in your life but if you have been to the one in the USA or to the Gold Coast in Australia it's pretty much the same. Getting there you can pay to go in cable car, or you can use you regular mrt ticket to catch the train or you can actually walk across a shaded bridge about 10 minutes to get there for free. For those who have never been to a theme park, wear comfortable shoes because you will be waiting in line a minimum of 30 mins to 1 and a half hours for each ride so in a day you can probably get through 5 to 8 rides. If you have small children think about bringing things to entertain them whilst waiting in hot queues. Don't miss the transformer ride, I think it's the best ride I've been on. For each ride you exit via a store which makes it difficult for parents with small children. See if you can promise them a toy at the end of the day and they can choose from all the shops they go through. Avoid buying somethings first up because they will pester you again at the next store. In terms of food it's all disgusting American fat fried food. If you are used to eating healthy, bring you own food because apart from the odd apple there is nothing you will be able to eat that is not stuffed with fat or sugar.  If you have money you can upgrade to a fast pass for $50 extra per person. I personally find this system disgusting because it basically means if you have money you can avoid waiting in line with the masses and if you don't, bad luck! Apart from that the decors are amazing, the rides pretty good and you can have memorable family day.

Layout is great with food, refreshments and toilets dotted around so you are never to far from those. Ticket pricing too is reasonable in my view considering the quality of entertainment. Kids can be kept entertained throughout the day with rides and shows. In my opinion way better that Disneyland Hong Kong where everything felt sub-par relatively speaking. Thoroughly recommended, buy the fast track as well to save some time (though even with that waiting could be quite long at times).

review_361447181,“Awesome is the word!”,"Since I have been to Disney land, I can not help comparing it but it was as expected, no doubt. There is a huge crowd on weekends and holidays and it is better if you start early so that you can finish as many rides as you can. Given it is not as big as Disney land, it can be covered in a single day if planned smartly with some very good rides. We took anti-clock wise way to start our rides. Some of the rides are kids specific and might be boring if you dont have one. My favorite rides in order are Transformer's, Blue Galactica (Cyclone - it is more difficult than red one as you go upside down and the air time is more, but you get the full view of universal studios from inside \m/), Mummy ride - with surprise elements in it. Rest of the rides are worth an experience as well.They dont allow outside food so make sure you had heavy breakfast if you are either a vegetarian or willing to save some money, as you dont have good veg options.Note**Check the timings before going because on some days it is open until only 6 instead of 8 pm. You can come here via monorail (4SG $ each). If you are more than 3 members I would suggest you better take taxi/uber because monorail is free for return trip and thus you can come here easily via cab paying the same or less amount and go back free! One more suggestion would be to not take return monorail from Imbiah, instead if you want to save some time and have some energy left, walk until waterfront station - which is hardly some 500-600 meters from here and take monorail from here, since it is less crowded as compared to Imbiah - which is Universal Studio's stop!Enjoy your trip!

I have a nine year old daughter and a 2 year old son who both were able to enjoy the rides and the facilities of the place. Some rides however that my son wanted to ride where in Jurrassic park and beauce of his height he was not allowed to go. My daughter however was able to ride most and had the time of her life. What I liked about the place was what every spot had a store to buy what you might need and there was an ample amount of food stores and bathrooms, we never had a problem with waiting in line. There were also a few new rides from when we last visited, which means the park is always bringing something new to the crowd to enjoy. The Water world area was closed however and we weren't able to watch the show which was a staple to every Universal Studios Visit. Universal Studios Singapore is really a good place to visit whether with family and friends where everyone is sure to enjoy.

review_361098695,"“Worth Every Ride, especially for first timer”","I came here with my fiancee, so we surely looking for something thrilling. Universal Studio offers it in a very well theme park setting. We can finish all te thrilling rides without the express pass. We even have some of them twice. Even if it was in Saturday and the park is pretty much crowded, the waiting line is not as long as what is noted in the entrance. For example, when a ride information board told us to expect 50 minutes waiting, we already finish the ride before 50 minutes.Most of the thrilling ride wouldn't allow you to bring bag inside the ride. Even when actually they have something like locker right next to the ride. So if you are in a thight budget, you better not bring bag of any kind.However, they have locker for rent. Do not take the locker in Jurassic Park section. It cost you $4.00 every hour. You can take the locker in Revenge of The Mummy section or in the Human vs Cylone section which offers free locker rent for 45 minutes and 115 minutes respectively.3 rides I mention above is the thrilling ride. The Jurassic Park is like a rafting track where you probably get soaking wet (luckilly I wasn't that wet). The Human vs Cylone is the Roller Coaster ride. Very fantastic, especially the Cylone one (blue track). The Mummy Revenge is indoor Roller Coaster which is also amazing. Don't forget to take the Transformer Rides which is mostly like virtual Roller Coaster with dramatic 3D experience. It was a real fun.Food here were expensive compared to those in the main island. The park closes at 8 pm. Most of the ride ends in 8 pm. However, the park is started to be less crowded by 5 pm at that day.Overall it was a very impressive experience especially for first timer.

The express ticketing system where people can pay to push in front of everyone patiently waiting is unfair (try explaining why people just keep pushing in front of you to your kids after they have been waiting patiently 40 minutes, kind of teaches kids it doesn't pay to be patient and that money can buy everything). The kids loves meeting the Minions and Madagascar characters.

Make sure you already choose the rides especially for popular rides, like Transformer, The Mummy revenge, and Battlestar Galactica.I suggest to watch the water world rides, Based on the blockbuster film, ""Waterworld"", witness a tidal wave of death-defying stunts, along with thrills and spills from real explosions of fire and water at this sensational live water show.

review_360511546,“Soo fun”,"We visited US around end of February and had such a great time! It is quite a long walk in to US if you choose to go via the Sentosa boardwalk so the train may be a good option if you wish to avoid this. Obviously we went in the low season so it wasn't that crowded and thankfully no rides were closed. Do check this on the website before you go because they tend to schedule maintenance in low seasons. However, despite the low season the queues were sooo long. There was at least an hour wait for each of the main rides which was a bummer. As suggested we HAD to purchase an express pass which is available in most shops inside the park. The express pass is an absolute necessity if you want to go on the rides. however, after 4-5 pm the crowds do lessen and we got to get on those same rides without a pass in like 5mins.The rides are worth it, i especially loved the Cyclone! The light show at night isn't all that and lasts for like 5 mins but try to get a good spot. Oh and the food/ drinks inside are ridiculously expensive- $6 for a bottle of water! so do bring your own drink and snacks. Overall we had a really fun day and would definitely recommend a visit

review_360267964,“10 Things to Note While Visiting Universal Studio”,"Dear all,Visited Universal Last week from India. It was awesome but due to lack of knowledge of my agent bit screwed. 1. Universal has 3 types of tickets: Normal Ticket (around 77 $), Express ticket (99 $) and Express unlimited(110$).2. Please note here visitors comes from across the world. I have seen groups from Russia, India, China, US.3. Since it was long Holi holiday in India could see lots of Indians. Because of this for each attraction I have stand min 1.5 hrs in line, this eats up ur whole day and you end up not seeing many of the attractions. 4. If you visit via agents that too via SIC (recommend never go by Singapore SIC) then you have limited timings like 5.30 pm.5. To avoid all such messup: Ensure you take express tickets (ask your agent to have that ticket only) . There we dont have any option to UPGRADE::X6. Ensure if you have baby then take pram with you (I ended up paying up 15$). You will min one whole day to visit universal completely. Also if you want to shop ensure you have min 200-300$ for shopping as no item is less than 50-60$.7. Try to get Universal map before you go there. You will save time in looking,planning, knowing attractions and route.8. Agents generally give out timing as 6'clock, however closing timing is around 8-9 pm. Agents gives this timing because night charge of SIC is high.9. Please note : Private car are cheaper than these SIC and unlike india you need not book it via mobile. There is a dedicated Taxi point at universal you get taxi very very easliy even at 11 pm.10. Taxi meter starts from 3.2$ (some starts from 3.9$), you can get both option as taxi comes very frequently. People stand in line and when their turn comes they see taxi standing in front of them (you can say helping guy over there that you want 3.2 $ taxi ( :) if want to save some money). I had bad bad experience with Apollo Travels SIC service: being very- very rude and their drivers keep on saying if you dont to wait, get out and take private taxi (they say so cos they already have ur money in their hand).Hope this review helps!!! Enjoy you trip to Singapore...

review_360220047,“2year olds first holiday”,"Great place to take kids. But if you have young kids and want to avoid lines, make sure you go on off peak times (not weekends or school holidays). We went on a Wednesday, just as it opened and the longest we had to line up for the first hour was 5min (and that's with a standard ticket). The park it self wasn't as big as I thought it would be, we did 2 loops of the park, but was a good size dragging a 2 year old boy around. Food was reasonably priced for a theme park. I was expecting it to be super pricey. We brought this large container of ice tea for $15 (I think) it was like a litre bottle and you could then get cheap refills. Good amount of rides for little ones and my husband and I took it in turns to go on the ""big kid"" rides. Public transport to the island is pretty easy. We took the mono rail the first day which was $8 per person then the second day to Sentosa we went along the board walk. The board walk has moving walkways nearly the whole way so you really don't need to walk that much

review_360202201,"“Make sure to visit the transformers ride, the rest of the rides were average ”","Before you enter into Universal there were no queues and we arrived around 11am. I read reviews on here on where to book the tickets cheaper and it was recommended to book via klook.com as you get the tickets 15% discount. Booked online with them no problem and same day received my e voucher tickets. The transformers ride is awesome even though we queued 50mins for it was worth the wait. The mummy ride to me was a basic roller coaster ride and nothing wow. For me it was just an average universal studios especially when you compare it to the one in the states. It is worth a visit as it's fun for the kids. The park closed at 8pm but we were pretty much done by 6.30 and went for a bite to eat after. Plenty of restaurants as soon as you enter out- Hard Rock Cafe, chijis, McDonald's, and plenty more. Make sure you cover up as it gets extremely hot. The good thing about the queues are the fans around to keep you cool. Inside queues have aircon

review_359978458,“A fun-filled day out!”,"When I asked my girlfriend what she most wanted to do in Singapore she answered ""I would like to take a photo in front of Universal World"", so popular has this place become that of all the shopping centres, restaurants and other attractions Singapore has to offer that the most important thing for tourists to do when visiting the ""little red dot"" is to take a photo in-front of the revolving Universal Studios logo globe out the front of its Sentosa Island theme park.After queuing to purchase a ticket and paying a reasonable entry fee, you need to queue to enter the grounds, then once inside you burst into a whole other world - you could be forgiven for mistakenly believing you are walking along Hollywood Boulevard itself, except this one is an all-weather one, completely under-cover!Once you have caught your breath and made your way to the first ride (in our case it was the Madagascar ride), you are soon breathless again because of the size of the... wait for it... Queue! 40mins!! Anyway, once we lined-up and eventually got aboard the ride, all was well - it's quite an experience, especially for children or those young-a-heart :)Then to the south is Shrek's Far Far Away Castle, which is just like the movie having been brought to life. Queue for Puss in Boots' Giant Journey or Shrek 4D Rides if you like - only 25-30mins each, haha! Onwards to Waterworld, which unfortunately during my visit was closed, so we moved West to Jurassic Park's Lost World where the biggest, most Jurassic queue I have ever come across exists (70mins), so we bypassed that one and went to ancient Egypt instead where everything is very beautifully crafted and with the heat it makes you feel you really are in Egypt with all the statues of Pharaohs & Hieroglyphic replicas - amazing!We then went to Steven Spielberg's Lights, Camera, Action! ride, which has the shortest queue of all at only 15mins, but was certainly very informative and interactive explaining how the stunts are often filmed for an action thriller. Thence there is the New York City-themed area, which, like Hollywood Boulevard, is I imagine about as close I will ever get to New York City without actually being there. Onwards to the technology park where Transformers-themed stuff is everywhere, which would be mesmerising for those inclined.Once you have done with the rides there is ample shopping and food shops strategically placed all over the park for your pickings. The products they sell are all genuine and of great quality, but as is to be expected in Singapore, expensive. With the exception of the queues, Universal Studios in Singapore is a wonderful day out - next time I return I will be purchasing the ""Express Pass"" for a relatively small additional cost, which I didn't know existed before entering the park.

review_359971936,“It can be crowded during weekends. Read on.”,"USS Singapore is slightly smaller than those outside the region. Having said that it's ideal for a 1 day visit. If you wish to cover all the rides(esp the popular ones)come early at 10am when the park opens.Like many suggested, go right straight to the popular rides. Skip the entrance and zip thru the crowd to the Galactica rides. Its the most thrilling ride you can ever find down there. Try both the Human and Cyclon both equally heart-pounding adrenalin rushing rides. Then move to the Transformer 3D. They are awesome thus the queue here can get very long too.These are at Sci-Fi City.Then move on to Revenge of The Mummy ride at Ancient Egypt. Don't be fooled by the peaceful mood at the entrance cos this ride is by far to me are 2nd best next to the Galactica rides. Treasure hunters rides aren't that interesting but often the queue may get long maybe because kids like it. Look out for the Characters at Madagascar and you can take photos and dance with them.Afterwhich you can continue with the other rides. Those rides i mentioned above can easily take an hour ++ to queue when the crowd starts to build up.For those with small children. The Shrek 4-D show is fun with all the effects can be felt on the seats while you enjoy the show. After the show there's a mini ferris wheels enough for 4 children to sit it just around the corner.Especially for toddlers, ride the Sesame Street Spaghetti, its so much fun.Weekends are always busier so go during weekdays unless it's a school holiday season you have no other way but to blend in and wait. Alternatively you can buy the express pass to skip the queue but it'll cost more.For special dietary meals esp halal, certified restaurants there are Mel's Drive at Hollywood and Oasis Spice cafe at the Ancient Egyptian.The Hollywood parade will begin at 3pm and fireworks will start at 9.30pm.Note: There are a lot of people especially during the weekends after the fireworks.

It will take all of your day and you still wont get to see all of its rides and attractions ... There are some rides in particular which i really enjoyed and would recommend to any and all adults who go there ...To be honest there were some kids 15-18 also going for the rides so it just depends on who likes thrilling, adrenaline raising rides ...Battlestar Galactica (Cyclon and Human) : These 2 roller coasters are the highlight of the park, usually have a large waiting period and long queues to it ... Transformer 3D: This ride is quite nice as well, you actually feel as if you are in the action sequence while you are seeing it in 3DThere are lots of variety for food with stalls in each section selling food matching the theme of that section of the park ... Same goes for the people who like buying memorabilia from the attractions they goto ...  I waited 70 mins and 120 mins respectively for the battlestar rides ... Better idea would be to buy a priority pass which reduces your waiting period to approximately 5-10 mins ... The only way you can finish all the rides in one day ... There is a fireworks show over the weekends around 8.30pm, which i have heard is quite nice to see ...

review_359330401,“Good fun for the day”,"This was our second visit to Universal Studios Singapore. USS is fun, clean and has some thrilling rides (although not enough to make it worth 5 stars). It's a small theme park which makes it perfect to see in 1 day and easy to manoeuvre around.Some general tips:-buy tickets through klook for a 15% discount and avoid queues at the gates-arrive at the park before 10. When the gates open go straight for the Transformers ride, Battlestar Galactica Rollercoaster and maybe Jurassic Park Rapids. Following this method you will NOT need an express pass (on weekdays at least). We got to do all rides multiple times, the queues disappear around 6.-the park is seriously hot especially in the afternoon. Bring lots of water and plan to visit the shows during this time-eat just outside the park at the Malaysian food hall to save moneyThe rides:-Mummy ride, transformers and Cylon are the best/most thrilling. Often the Mummy ride has only a 5 minute queue-Jurassic Park Rapids queue is insanely long. Either ride it between 10-11 o'clock or after 6 to avoid a 1 hour + waiting time. Take your bags on with you to avoid locker fees (bring some waterproof pouches for phones/cameras)-New Puss in Boots ride not worth the long queues. Anticlimactic. Also the Madagascar rides can be easily skipped unless travelling with small children-Enchanted Airways Rollercoaster is unexpectedly good and worth doing

review_358694663,“HOT”,"We have been going to USS for more than 20 times already since it opened. I have to say that a good thing about this theme park is it re-invents itself. It changes shows depending on the occasion, there are a few new rides now, even the parade changes.But the bad thing about this place is the heat!!! The heat is terrible! Guest services need to be beefed up too! We waited 2 hours just to renew our season pass!!! It's even longer than waiting for a ride.

review_358685443,“Go early and buy the express pass”,"Visited as a family with two young kids (5 and 9). Arrived at 9.30 for 10am opening. Initially didn't buy express pass as cost was extra $70 per person! Very steep cost but after reading the pricing is 'dynamic' I assumed it would be very busy. First hour was ok, but from 11 onwards wait times were up to 100 mins for most popular rides. Express was walk right in. Adds a big cost at $280 extra for family of four but worth it. Still think Legoland Malaysia is much better value for money and more to do for young kids. Wouldn't come back to USS until kids are early teens at least as most rides are suited to older kids.

review_358628751,“If you can afford it seriously consider the express addition to your ticket ”,"We had a great day, we arrived at opening (first big hint) and were able to do most of the big queue rides quickly. An hour after opening this disappears quickly. The queue for the raft ride was 60 minutes long by the time we got there, first express pass use, we boarded in two minutes. The food outlets get very crowded at the back of the park around 12 midday, try and plan to be elsewhere. The big roller coasters get 90 minute queues as the day progresses, shortened to 10 minutes with express pass (2nd hint).The rides are intense versus big, we enjoyed the day a lot, I liked the seat fitting station at most rides, need to add one on the canopy flight ride.

review_358575769,“Go early and on a weekday”,"We went with a 6 year old so some of the rides weren't suitable. It was a long hot day spent queuing and we went on a week day. Some rides were a 45 minute wait which is hard for a small child. We worked out where to buy the express pass later in the day so it wasn't worth buying as it does add a big cost to your day. Would definitely make the day moe enjoyable but if the budget doesn't stretch that far be prepared to wait for rides.

review_358502778,“Perfect ”,"We purchased the tickets for USS as well as for the cable cars prior visiting which saved waiting times at the queue.We selected the cable car to go to the USS. It was a fantastic view from the above.We visited there on Monday and it was not that crowded. First of all we visited to the Transformers the VR ride which we had to stay on queue for around 1 hour( in a less crowded day ). But it was worth the day, as it was really exiting. Next we selected the cyclone the best and adventurous roller coster in USS. If you are afraid of the speedy roller coasters you can select the human version of it. For this ride also we had to wait around 45 mins in the queue. Both of these attractions were at Sci-fi city.Then we went to the Ancient Egypt and went in revenge of the mummy ride. It was again one of the best. In Jurassic park , far far away land and puss in boots also you have some other roller coaster versions.We enjoyed the shrek 4D show as well. Tips, Carry a water bottle. You can refill it any place.Wear some lite clothes.Bring your own food if possible.

review_358426363,“Excellent day out for adults too! ”,"We are two adults in our 30s and had an excellent day at Universal Studios. Tips:1) Try and arrive when the park opens (10am) before the queues get long. 2) DEFINITELY buy an Express pass. This is worth its weight in gold. We bought the option that gives you one express access, but there is also a (more expensive) option to have unlimited express access. This saved us hours and hours. Eg. Battlestar Galactica (blue roller coaster) - 10 minutes in queue, versus 50 minutes for regular pass. The other Battlestar roller coaster (red) was our worst queue (45 minutes) versus 2 hours 20 minutes for the regular pass. With all other rides, we were on the ride in less than 10 minutes. The most popular rides are the two Battlestar roller coasters and the Transformers ride, so do these early. 3) Lockers - we hired a small locker all-day for SG$15. Again, very useful and highly recommend. For the roller coasters, you can't have any thing in your pockets as you go upside down. Unless you have someone to hold things for you, a locker is essential. They are located at various points around the park. 4) Water - being Singapore, it is very hot and humid. There are quite a few drink fountains around the park where you can fill up your water bottle which is very useful. Really fun day!

review_358339162,“Finally the kids are big enough to enjoy most of it”,"At 7 and 5, the kids are finally old enough to enjoy the majority of the rides. At 102 cm, all but 3 rides were accessible. The Shrek 4D adventure was great fun, as were most rides. Transformers was amazing! But also too old for my kids who were terrified (both girls too). Rides end up with long waits quickly 100 mins+), so either pay for the express passes, or be happy to get on your favourite rides at the start of the day and then picking whatever has a shorter wait in the afternoon. Ditch the park food and head out to Din Tai Fung or the Hard Rock for lunch. And avoid the pantomime performances at the Pantages Theatre. The shows are terrible, some of the worst rubbish I have seen in a long time (plot, acting, sound, the whole shooting match). Avoid the weekend or public holidays for a more pleasant experience.

We got lucky as couple of our friends joined us in this plan. It was a day well spent and we enjoyed alot. To my surprise my son had fun too starting from watching a movie show, Madagascar and dinosaur rides and so on. Just an advise if you don't want to wait for longer duration standing in queue go for a priority pass. Do not carry lot of stuff with you but in case you need to, don't worry you can keep your belongings in the locker available near rides where you cannot take them along especially roller coster. To all the couples who don't want to leave their kids behind, you don't have to. Just go and have a blast..

We had a fabulous full on day. The park is extremely clean & very well mainted, there are rides & attractions for all ages & and thrill seeking levels!! We were pleasantly surprised with the price & selection of food & drinks available through out the day. My biggest tip would be to purchase a fast pass which helps you skip long queue's & walk to the front of the lines. We worked this out after waiting 1hour 40mins for the Jurassic Park ride. Longest wait of the day. We had a fantastic day and were completely exhausted by the end of it. I thoroughly recommend Universal Studios Singapore as a fabulous attraction & value for money day out.

My experience with wife and kid was also awesome, for most of the shows. However, almost every show the queue is too long – in some cases we had to wait even more than 1 hour standing. A better queue or crowd management is expected from this world class facility. Another very important thing is most of the shows include bumpy rides kind of things, which may not be preferred by many of the visitors. There should be a good balance of different types of rides – some bumpy, some extreme, some normal, some smooth to offer each visitor as per his/her preference. Overall, it was really an excellent experience, specially for my 10 years daughter. Worth spending the money and time for. I may not go again but everyone should pay at least one visit into this amazing world of entertainment.

review_356760764,“Fun and exciting experience for everyone !!!”,"I had doubts on USS after hearing not so good feedback from friends but I had to entertain my two boys (age 9 & 15) because it was March school holidays! Turned out, I had so much fun myself! I love roller coaster that I took Revenge of The Mummy ride 3 times and Transformers ride twice! I was laughing and screaming with happiness during the Revenge of The Mummy rides because it's roller coaster in the darkness!!Initially I only bought the regular tickets but changed my mind after looking at the 5 rows of long queues at 945 am. So I bought the Express tickets ($50) for 3 of us. It is expensive but I thought queuing for rides will be tiring for the boys and will kill the fun. Our second ride was Transformers and there isn't many people queuing. The good thing is the staff will not encourage you to use your Express ticket if there isn't long queues. The Express ticket is one ride per attraction but you can join the normal queue line if you want to ride again. Because we went there early, we could take some of the rides at least twice. Food and drinks are expensive, of course! There are many water coolers around USS. In my opinion, go early and there is no need to buy Unlimited rides ticket. Unless you have kids who are crazy to go for rides many times. But my boys would love the Unlimited rides of course. Do spend that extra dollars for the Express Tickets because you will save a lot of time to enjoy USS and no need to endure with people who cut queues! If anyone tried to cut your queue, do tell them to go the back. I saw a few people who were shocked to see someone cut their queues and just stood there wondering. Now my boys is asking me for a visit to Universal Studios Orlando!! I am secretly excited myself because I know the roller coaster rides there is crazy!!!

It was very hotyand humid so not very pleasnt waiting all that time in line with two 9 year olds. It came to a stage where we couldn't be bothered queuing for rides and decided to leave (it would have been worth buying an unlimited express pass each but that was about another $50 each).On the plus side, it is very easy to get to by MRT to Harbourside and then the Sentosa Express across to Waterfront station.

If you are going with kids, consider the limitless option because some rides are fabulous and they might like to ride over and over again. Do take note of the shows and the fireworks at night as they are well worth seeing. The aquarium is fabulous and so are the activities offered. We tried the Sega walk, zip lining and the skyline luge. Great experiences for the entire family !

review_356487993,“A Thrilling Adventure!”,"One place where you can forget about everything and just go crazy! Have been there twice in consecutive years and trust me I can go there again and again. The team that works there is simply amazing! The performers are best at what they do and some acts will surely leave you in awe. My suggestion, reach there in the morning and stay through the day because the performances are timed and there are different interesting things to keep you busy, other than the rides. Don't forget to try all the roller coasters, specially Battlestar Galactica. No matter whatever age-group you belong to, there is something for everyone. You would surely fall in love with the place.

review_356454943,“Excellent place ”,"We went here on the first Monday of school holidays. If you can avoid it I would suggest not going on one of these days. It was very busy and long lines. We ended up waiting for the jurrasic park ride for 1.50Hours. When we lined up the sign said 50 minutes (long but we wanted to) by the time the hour mark came around we were far to committed (and stuck in the line) to leave the ride was excellent but would have been better to be honest about wait times and we would have come back. This was the same for the transformers.The park is very clean, the food was ok and reasonably priced. There is plenty to do. We got there shortly before 10 and got in quickly and did a few of the easy rides. The wait times blow out so good to pick the few you really want to go on and get them done early. Plenty of shows and things to do and see so I would suggest taking some time to plan the day to get everything in. We did our shopping last thing before we left toMinimise carrying things around and didn't have any problems getting what we wanted. This is a great day very long and hot, water sunscreen and hats are a must.Worth doing

Reached around 10 A.M. Queue on the gate, 10 min. Ran towards Transformer Ride and found another queue. Waited for 30-40 min for our first ride. Transformer was awesome. ""Once more Once more "" :-):-) ""Bigger queue bigger queue"" :-(:-( . I decided to buy Express Unlimited. Imagine the queue on other rides. It is expensive but totally worth it.Got around each and every ride .....many times. Had lot of fun. My advice if u can stretch your pocket....go for it.. u wont regret it and if u r a tourist, what r d chances of coming back. + Reach before opening time. U would like to spend whole day here.+ Outside food is not allowed, but they didn't checked bags. So.. + Many restaurants. Mel's drive in , A Chicken burger and coke costs 12 SG i think. Tasty.+ Water bottle is must to carry. Water fountain are available widely.+ Locker are available at cost. Free locker duration of 89 min for Mummy and Battlestar.+ Wear flip flop, not shoes ...Very convenient, carry extra t-shirt if u can.+U can identify the camera (Big Flash) during the rides n give pose next time.

review_355481265,“Still a highlight in an adult's life”,"I've visited Universal Studios Hollywood in the late 1990's. And after 17 years, I set foot on its ASEAN counterpart in Singapore. I may have enjoyed the rides more as a kid, but I appreciated the art, the spectacle, the complexity of movie making more, as an adult, with this later experience.The rides with the Mummy and Transformers were still a thrill, but it was that Steven Spielberg spectacle of being in the set that really set this experience high for me. Aside from getting cooked with the heating and fire effects, and getting wet with the rain and spashes fo the indoor river, being there on-set, made me think, why the hell did I not go into the industry of movie-making??Downside is the price. Everything in Singapore is expensive I'd say, and Universal Studios is no exception.

As great as the park is without them you can be waiting up til an hour for the more popular rides the only disappointment with the passes is although they say they are unlimited there is small print that says there are a few rides that aren't included which is disappointing considering you are paying extra for it to be unlimited. saying that i wouldn't do Universal without them.There is water fountains all over the park. The food is diverse you can get anything from burger and fries to chicken and rice or curry. We had an amazing time make sure you wear sunscreen it gets really hot.

review_354745927,“USS Easter Eggstravaganza”,"USS is currently holding their Easter event. This year, you need to get a separate ticket to take part in the egg hunt, watch the show at the Pantages and go for the Meet & Greet. The ticket is $15 at the door or $10 online.Pro tip: Starbucks at the Forum has free WIFI, and Guest Services can process your e-voucher :)The egg hunt was actually quite fun...some of the eggs are very well hidden. The prize is a large Minion-themed egg filled with various banana flavoured candy and Minion stickers.The show ""An unEGGspected Wedding"" at the Pantages was a bit of a let-down, mainly by the poor audio. It was a bit hard to follow the plot due to the muffled dialogue, supposedly it is a sequel to last year's story. Try to be at the theatre earlier as there is a small pre-show segment. After the show, you can go to the Meet and Greet at ""Eggingham Gardens"" to take photos with the Easter Bunny (?), Humpty Dumpty (he's an egg...Easter is eggy) and some of the cast from the show.We also opted for the Easter lunch buffet at Casa Del Wild (halal, limited choices for vegetarians). At $38, you get the Easter activities above as well as a decent lunch buffet. There is also a small egg painting activity, they even provided aprons for you to stay clean. The characters from Madagascar come around for photo taking during lunch. It wasn't crowded when we went, so we had a nice, unhurried lunch. The buffet included salads, Western food (potato gratin, chicken roulade), Asian dishes (fried rice, laksa) and a small dessert selection (carrot cake, bread pudding). There was pizza, fried chicken and hash browns for the kids. It was definitely better than what I expected. Drinks (refillable) are $3/person.There is some Easter deco around the park, mainly along New York. The Sunlight Eggspress (roller skate crew) does a short, awkward performance and hands out bead necklaces. Two short projection shows take place after 7pm at the New York Library.Overall, this event might appeal more to pass holders because it may be a little difficult to complete the whole park together with the Easter eggtivities. Or if you have children who are too young to take most of the rides, they can be kept entertained with this package.Other park tips:- hit the park in an anticlockwise manner, we noticed it was less crowded this way- don't try to skip queues or try your luck with single rider q when you want to sit with your group- many water coolers onsite to stay hydrated- check rws website for latest ticket offers- to Express pass or not to Express pass? The crowds can be a tad unpredictable, so if you don't mind q-ing or missing a few rides, then you don't have to buy one.

review_354698865,“Awesomest place in Singapore >>>>>”,"if you like rollercoasters, movies, food, fun, adventure, etc.. this place is for you!A days entry costs around 74SGD, I would recommend buying 98SGD season ticket which gives 6 month entry :) as covering the whole place and all rides is impossible in a days time even with EXPRESS passes (which cost 55-60SGD) over an above your entry ticket.Useful tip for people who want to save time - Go as 'Single Riders' even when you are with friends, as the queue there is smaller and you get to enjoy rides quickly, but only seated with strangers and not your pals... Trust me its fine... as you save time and energy.Lockers are available at entry and near each ride. there is a free time outside of each ride to keep your stuff. and incase you are carrying many things, buying a locker outside near the entry is advisable.All rides are fun. Don't miss Egypt, Jurassic Park and Transformers rides... all of them are amazing. For Jurassic park ride, you will get splashed with water so be prepared... if you don't want to spend money on locker, outside this ride(as there is no free time) a simple hack is carrying a small plastic bag to keep your wallets and cell phones) ... you can get wet and dry off easily by soaking the sun in 20 mins :)Wear comfortable clothing.. half trunks and t-shirts are best for men and women feel free to wear whatever but long skirts, delicate dressing, and too many accessories is not advisable....Carry caps, sunscreen..

review_354464947,“Fun Day Out”,"didnt really want to go here but thought we should as we were in Singapore. So glad we did. Super fun day. We turned into teenagers again and laughed and screamed our heads off on the rides. would go back in a heart beat. Very much like Disneyland in Anaheim, even down to the terrible fried food on offer at the cafes. The Universal Express pass is worth the extra money so you can go right to the front of the queue. The Cylon Rollercoaster is amazing and the Mummy ride also thrilling.

review_354332280,“Fun Day”,"This was a fun day trip. Things were amusement park priced as is typical but not too bad. They do a small discount if you purchase things with a MasterCard Debit/credit card. The lines weren't too bad. The rides are pretty good, I was slightly disappointed with the Jurassic Park section, I feel like it could definitely be updated and expanded. But overall a funway to spend a day. If the lines are small you can do all the rides in 4 hours or so if you stop in every shop. It opens at 10, but not everywhere is open until 11, so you don't have to be there right away.

Great thing during the visit was there were not much people. We can say that the waiting time for each ride is not that bad compared to the other review given. I hope the company will not stop entertaining the kids!

The place has a good number of games and attractions for a varieties of ages , I'd highly recommend getting your tickets online and arriving early so you beat the rush and longs lines. Also I'd highly recommend getting the VIP pass , yes it might be a bit pricy but it's worth it when you don't have to wait 30-40 mins to get on each ride cz of the long lines specially on weekends !

review_353734730,“Go to Halloween Horror Nights in October!”,"I had a lot of fun at the park in the afternoon with my group of friends. It's very easily to access, just off the monorail. However, I must admit the real reason this attraction gets a 5 star rating from me is for the Halloween Horror Nights experience. It was really like stepping into a twisted horror movie at times. The downside is that the lines are really long and you may not get to do everything you want because you'll be spending maybe three hours standing in a line for one haunted house (It's kind of worth it if you love that sort of thing). During the afternoon most of lines were alright. The Battlestar Galactica line was very long but it's a pretty good ride (The Cylon ride is the best).

review_353579401,“Weekdays are the best”,"Weekdays are when you can enjoy the park the most: shortest rides queue, most chances to take a picture with the characters. Rides like Transformer and the Mummy only takes 5 - 10 minutes to my surprise! Battlestar galactica ~20 to 30 minutes instead of 50-60mins. There are lots of free water dispensers in the park in the middle of the queue lines, so bring a water bottle and keep hydrated in singapore's hot weather. That's cheaper than purchasing bottled water ($3 cheapest). Indoor rides like Madagascar, Sesame Street, Shrek 4D and the Revenge of the mummy are nice air-con places to escape from the sun.Food cost around $10-$15 in the various themed cafeterias in the park, outside food is not allowed, but it doesn't stop you from exiting the park for lunch (You can re-enter). Malaysian food street outside USS offers a lot of food at $5-$7.Best rides in my opinion: the mummy, battlestar galactica, Jurassic park rapids

review_353550414,“Not like in LA but still super”,"I had a chance to be in the Universal Studios in LA so th first part of my review is a comparison. The main difference is this theme park has different regions like Sci-fi, Egypt, Jurrasic park, Far Far Away, Madagascar and New York street. Half of the rides are really childish. Light roller coasters or carousels. And the other half is the same as in LA except one, the Battlestar Galactica double roller coaster. The Jurrasic boat ride, the Mummy's Revenge and the Transformers ride are identical. In overall the place is smaller than in LA and less exciting for an adult. If you just want to try new rides and have been in LA, you can totally skip it and save a lot of time and money.But in general as an amusement park it is a lot of fun! It's good to see characters and places out of the movies and walk around in life like sets. If this is you first time in a Universal Studios Park you can spend your entire day here trying out everything (sadly, most of time is spent in queues). Come early, even half hour before opening! Then you have a chance to try the most exciting rides fast. I recommend going in this order: Transformers, Battlestar Galactica Human then Cyclon, The Mummy and then Jurrasy Park boat ride. Luckily these rides are coming in this order in the park, you don’t have to go back and forth just forward. Don't miss the Universal if you haven't been in one before!

review_353131276,“Nice but not spectacular”,"If you are going there with or without kids, start at 10am when it opens so you can cover as many of the rides and attractions in there. Due to the lengthy queues for each ride, you end up spending just as many hours in queues as enjoying any of the rides & attractions. If your budget allows, I would strongly suggest paying extra so you don't have to waste time queuing. Hold on to kids as it would be very easy to lose them in the crowds.

review_352999398,“Best Theme Park in Singapore but...”,"Considering the amount of theme parks in Singapore being barely a handful, Universal Studios has made itself to the top. Been here about 10 times since it's opening years ago. Many fond memories forged here. Generally a very small park. You would be able to completely go through the park in half a day if not for the ridiculously horrendous waiting time. Or you can pay another 50% to your already expensive ticket to get an express pass. Maybe they can implement selective express time slot for free to regulate the crowd much like DisneyWorld? Then again there's nothing worse than the wait for special events like the Halloween Horror. While the attractions are good, the time taken to enter a 90 seconds attraction just leaves a bad taste in the mouth.Overall, it's a fun place to be in but be prepared to wait wait and wait.

review_352681158,"“Absolutely fab day, recommend it!”","We had a great day, lucky with the weather it has to be said, but for the unlimited cable car ride and entrance to universal it was just S$100 per person about £50 - considering you have to pay to go on the island anyway, this was a reduced price and good value considering how much uk parks cost now. You can get there cheaper, but the cable car is great and your pass to the attractions is about 10 dollars less that way. The rides were good, the battlestar galactica roller coasters especially. Not a huge park but good for a day out. We went on a Tuesday in Feb and didn't have to wait more than around 40 mins for the most popular rides, most were only about 10- 15 mins. There are other parks on the island but we didn't visit them. The whole place as you would expect from Singapore was amazingly clean, including the loos of course.

review_352495652,“Patience for the long queues is a must.”,"It was a trek to get here, and we went on Monday to beat the weekend queues- we took the Harbourfront MRT, went to Vivo city 3rd floor to take the Sentosa Express. $4 per adult for a return ride.There are three sections to sentosa and we got off at the first stop which links to the Resort world where Universal studios is located. Cost was approx $72 entry fee per adult.We waited approx 1 hour for each ride, and after 5 rides the queues and humidity got to us. Having being to US in USA and movie world in QLD australia i thought this was a bit of a let down. If you buy the express tickets you could get on the rides in about 10-20 minutes but an additional $50 per person. We did observe some staff did not check all riders for this type of ticket so was a bit let down that some where still pushing in and claiming their express line ticket.Some of the souvenirs were discoloured from the sun. eg the minions were pale yellow and looked old due to the wear and tear of the sun- mainly minion and sesame st characters sold.Overall an average day for two adults and eventually the lines and humidity told us to go home after 4 rides and almost 5 hours. If you are short on time get the express tickets. If we had a choice to go back, we wouldnt recommend it and the time it takes to get there + costs weren't that worth it.LInes back to Vivo city was extremely long. You need patience!

Third, you get a 5 S$ meal voucher.TIP 2: Try to visit during weekdays, be there at opening time. Then you won't need to pay extra for the fast pass. I covered all the rides at least two times.TIP 3: If in party of 3 or 4 take a taxi from the city center, you save time and money.

review_351763649,"“A fun day, a good theme park!”","Traveled in Feb 2016 as a coupleTimings: It opens at around 10.00 am and closes by around 7.00 pm. Tickets: Ticket price is around USD 74 per person but you generally get discount of 10% either through their own website (master card offer) or through other sites. We booked through their own website, got a 10% discount and free shrek mugs worth SGD 20. Generally it is advisable to book in advance as there are long queue for ticket purchase also. Also note that for advance booking be sure of the date as the tickets are generally non-refundable and non-amendable unless for extraordinary cases. Express pass costs around USD 50 per person more. Take a print out of the online ticket as that will suffice for entry.Getting There: Take the MRT to the harbor front station and either take the Sentosa Express from the 3rd floor of Vivo City Mall or take the cable car.The Sentosa Express is the cheaper option (SGD 4 for the return trip), you need to get down at the waterfront station and follow the signs to Universal Studio. Cable car costs around 25 SGD (but also includes ride on cable cars in the Sentosa Island) You might also take the cab.Rides: We enjoyed All the rides. Battlestar Galactica and the Mummy were the highlights of the day. Transformers was also good but after the 1 hour wait we lost the charm for Transformers. We did both the Human and Cyclon rides in Battlestar and found the cyclon ride to be more thrilling and exciting. Cyclon is the one which is suspended and involves a lot of twisting and turning including 360 degree spins. The queue is also shorter in cyclon as compared to human. We also enjoyed the water show, the donkey show and the Shrek 4D Movie. The water show and the donkey shows are at specific timings so kindly note the same before going. You will get wet in the water ride in the Jurrasic Park section (you may buy a polythene cover at SGD 4 at the entrance of the ride or carry your own). Puss in the boots also looked good but after doing cyclon you may give it a miss if the waiting time is long.Lockers: Bags are generally not allowed for rides like battlestar galactica, mummy and the water ride in jurassic park section. Free lockers are available outside Battle star galactica (first ~50 min. free) and the mummy ride (first ~ 40 min. free). Other lockers are chargeable.Tip - bring hat, sunglasses as it get really hot. Food in the park is expensive, you may choose to carry your own food. I would advise to do the famous rides in the afternoon when the water show starts (around 1 PM). Most of the people are seated in the stadium for the water show and the waiting time for rides during this time for us was 15-20 min. You may catch the water show later at ~4.30 Pm. We went there on a Sunday instead of a Friday or a Saturday as advised to us by our friends in Singapore. Sundays are relatively less crowded.

review_351736499,“was great but...”,"when we talk about singapore, one of the first things that comes up in someone's head is Universal Studios...and so we went! it was great! the place was nice and if you're a fan of the movies, you will certainly be able to relate to everything, getting you so excited to see everything. but then, it was too crowded that we were only really able to ride two things (madagascar crate adventure and the roller coaster). everything was full, it took forever! we really just had to patiently wait for our turn on the roller coaster (to make our trip at the place worth it). but, hey, the roller coaster was worth the wait! it was crazy fun! and i love that they had drinks sold everywhere in the place (the weather was too hot to bear). and the lockers (for those who want to ride the roller coaster) they provide proved to be safe. we had to leave everything we had (our camera, engagement ring, passports, wallets) and not a thing was lost. one more star for that!

review_351442500,“Smaller than US ones but adequate”,"Don't expect it to be like the USA. Rides are a lot milder.. We visited in February and it was not very busy which was great. We got there at 9.30, opens at 10am and was not busy so we got on a few main rides really quickly, then we used our express pass. I would say It's worth paying the extra $30 (especially when busy) as it's hot waiting in queues. Although they have drink fountains and fans going. But at this time of year (after Chinese New Year) only a few of the top rides had waiting times of 25-30 mins, most we were on in 5-10 mins.

Only to our utter dissappointment, apart from the ride to do with a tomb or something (some sort of indoor roller coaster), teens/young adults really dont have much to enjoy, the two HUGE roller coasters were shut. And those are the main reason why we even went, I would definitely not recommend anyone to go there, if you have kids, it may be fun, but anyone upwards of 11 is gonna be bored.

review_350972466,“A great place but better if the show was on”,"Universal Studios is located on Sentosa Island which can be reach by taxi or cable car. Discounted tickets are available through the rwsentosa.com website for Mastercard holders and include a Shrek drinking cup until May 2016. We went a couple of days ago but were disappointed that the Waterworld show is not on every day. This was not shown on their website. Other parades and singing performances were cancelled due to rain so check out the forecast before you go. It opens 10.00am - 7.00pm. Riding the Transformer experience was amazing as were some of the other rides. Smaller than Universal in LA, it is still worth the visit at $68 after discount. Other things to do on Sentosa include Aquarium, lovely restaurants and a water park. It's a full day out.The view from the cable car is wonderful. Catch it from Mount Faber ($29 return) for the longest ride and if you catch it back early evening, you can enjoy the pretty lights of Singapore..

review_350924289,“Unlimited Express pass is worth it if you have young kids or want to enjoy all rides”,"It was crazy during CNY .... initially we bought only entry tickets, went inside, there wasn't much crowd but the queues were huge!After waiting in a normal queue for about 45 mins...we decided to get the Express pass - we got the Unlimited Express pass for SGD 90 each, had loads of fun....not all rides are for the young ones (min height 120) so it turned out good as the kids could enjoy unlimited rides without any wait times - the longest we had wait in the Express queue was 5 mins only - so it TOTALLY worth it!!!!We enjoyed ALL the rides except 1 or 2 that were suddenly shut for maintenance...another thing is that for all the really good rides (Ancient Egypt, Jurrasic Park, Sci Fi etc) they said there is a wait time of 40 mins for Express and advise to go for other rides, so we went on another one and again they said the same. but this time we said ok and went inside and found it wasn't the case, we got in less that 5 mins - not sure why they said so....We spent the whole day there, food is plenty inside, veggie options too...Suggestion: Take the map and go in reverse order, starting at Scifi or Jurrasic, all the good rides are on the right and this is were all the ""locals"" or people visiting again go, as first timers we didn't don't know ....we could have missed withour the Express pass!!!

We were encouraged before the day to purchase ""fast pass"" which was well worth the money! We waited no more than 10 mins for any ride. All the shows were well worth lining up to see. Shrek 4D can be quite confronting for young children or those with sensory issues as very loud and due to being 4D your seat moves and you do get sprayed in the face a few times.Best rides included Jurassic world Rapids, Shrek and Madagascar as well as Transformers!Great day out had by all and our son talks about it most days so it definitely had a lasting impression

review_350272656,“Bring back the Kid in you ;)”,"I visited Universal Studio last June 2015 just before my birthday. My visit to Singapore was very short and decided to pay a visit in the Universal Studio and Sentosa. Who said going there alone is not as fun as going with friends? I enjoyed my time wandering around Universal Studio. Its as if a small Global Village where you can visit the famous places in the world like Egypt and New York. The Staff were very courteous and knowledgeable of all the directions and rides. The place is very organize and very entertaining too. Rides are very safe though some rides were a little scary but you can trust the materials they used in the Park were up to safety standards.There was a food court close to the Jurassic Park which is big enough for the customers however there were limited variety of foods. The serving was a little small but is fine, food service was fast and the food court areas were clean.They keep the park clean and entertaining for all ages, I have to admit that the Water World show was the best show they have and would recommend to watch... its worth a wait for the show pal! In order to enjoy the whole park one must spent a day, some rides have a really long line to wait and when you get there you'll realize that you've waited an hour for a 15 minutes ride. When you go to Sentosa just before riding the Train please do not buy the 2 pass tickets (Sentosa and Universal Studio) why? it is because you will not be able to utilize it all since Universal Studio will cost you a day.Another tip going to Sentosa, you can walk from the mall to Universal Studio rather than taking a train that will cost you more... Honestly the walk is worth trying to see the beauty of Sentosa, at night while walking you will also see a robotic bird show in the water. In case you finish late in Universal Studio which is mostly the case, it is better to take a walk from there to the mall and ride your train home rather than being in a big line to ride the train back to the mall. If you plan to watch the most exciting show they have (water World) I recommend to bring an extra shirt and be ready to get wet! also don't forget to be jolly and friendly. Going there alone was fun and memorable, you get to meet a lot of strangers that will become your new friends. It takes back all your childhood memory about fairy tales, castles, princesses and Cartoon friends you used to know. It makes you feel young again and get away from the stress outside the walls of Universal Studio.

It's our fault we were expecting too much of this place. First of all the Strong points of this place:Perfect for families with young children!Lots of shows and mild adventure rides to cater all ages. Great 3D adventure rides with special effects (the best for us was Transformers).Located in Sentosa, so you can do more things in one day apart of the universal studio experience. Good public transport connections.The weakest points of this place:Not as big as it looks like.. You could spend around 4 hours to do most of the rides and walking around.If you are expecting rides like some found in Alton Towers in UK(with no fatal accidents as with the Smiler of course) like 13, Air or Oblivion..Or the ones in Port Aventura in Tarragona (Dragon Khan, El diablo..) There's two fast rides but I found them milder to those mentioned!So this is our opinion, it's not for thrill seeking people. We might be back when we have kids though.. Who knows!

review_348988347,“Amazing!”,"Fans of the US parks won't be disappointed by this park. As a big Universal fan I couldn't wait to get in and it offered something slightly different even if it was on a smaller scale. Even though its hard to not compare it to its bigger counterparts it does still offer a great day out and that is reflected in the price. In the Singapore Tourist Centres you can usually find a map that has lots of coupons attached and this is usually one of them to get around $5 off. Food choices are limited but that is to be expected in a theme park, but the rides are fantastic as are a couple of the shows and the waits aren't too ridiculous.

review_348801840,“Fun Place: Buy Express pass to enjoy comfortably!!”,"Undoubtedly my best day in Singapore was spent in Universal Studios.I went to the USS during Chinese New Year, hence it was crowded. The lines were long and the waiting time for every ride was more than 2 hours. However, I avoided everything by buying the express pass (80 SGD for one time ride), thanks to the recommendation by a friend.Everything is meticulously planned, the rides are fun, the food is amazing (Egyptian Town) and the place has so much to offer.My package tour to USS ended at 6pm but I decided to stay back. The 12 hours I spent there went by in a jiffy.You can never get over the amazing rides of Transformers/Mummy and the Roller Coaster (small but scary).The place has a lot of souvenir shops but they are expensive. The ride back to the city is easy. The Sentosa tram connects you to the nearest MRT (Metro train) station.Crazy place to be!!

review_348769070,“Plan your day well to make the maximum out of the visit”,"This place has 7 zones, lined one after the other.The variety of rides are both for children and adults, fun rides and adventurous rides.It would be very helpful to do some research beforehand and make a list of rides one wants to take in order of priority.Figuring out on the spot can be a hassle because by mid day the waiting time can be as long as 2 hours.I would recommend spending the entire day there, We could do all the rides of our preference and some additional rides too.Plenty eating points are available within the premises but one can take their own food too.Some rides we loved - Revenge of the mummy ( Ancient Egypt), TRANSFORMERS The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle ( Sci-Fi City) , Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (The Lost World)Some shows we loved - Lights, Camera, Action!™ Hosted by Steven Spielberg (Hollywood), Waterworld (The Lost World) - only 2 shows in a dayGetting there - take a free walk on Boardwalk ( the path has moving walkway so one does not have to walk much) or cable car for a view or sentosa express for $4.Sentosa express can be taken from Level 3 of Vivocity mall. People coming from MRT need to get down at Harbourfront MRT station which opens into Vivicity mall.Boardwalk can be taken from Level 1 of Vivocity mall.Sentosa express transportaion is free on the sentosa island and also for the return journey from Sentosa island to Vivocity mall.

It is a draining experience so energy level needs to be high. Don't wait more than an hour at any one spot. It is a waste of time. If there is a long waiting time try to go on ahead and find a spot where the waiting time is less and come back later to those you have missed. Special mention for Battlestar Galactica and Mummy.

review_348079010,“A really good experience”,"My boyfriend and I bought the season pass for Universal Studios Singapore. We went to Universal Studios Singapore quite a number of times due to the unlimited number of entries for the season pass and we felt that it's a really good value for money. I would strongly recommend locals to buy the season pass as it can really save you alot of money and you also get more perks like discounts and all that.We absolutely loved and enjoyed our time there in USS even though the main roller coaster (Battlestar Galactica) was under maintenance during the period of our season pass. We're thrill seekers, it would be much more enjoyable for us if there were more rollercoasters in USS. So because we did not get to ride on Battlestar Galactica, I would say the best ride for us is the Revenge of the Mummy and the Transformers ride. The rest of the rides were more for kids, but it was still okay for us, young adults.The queues at some of the rides are rather long, don't bother queueing for them, instead go for another ride with a shorter queue and come back later, most of the time the long queues will shorten by then. I would recommend people to spend about half a day in USS, it's more than enough time to cover all the good rides. (:

No need to book a tour if you can take public transport or a taxi.This is one of the best places to take your kids. But one should definitely buy the VIP pass which allows to save your time on queues and if kids want to experience the amusements multiple times, you wont regret it. We went on a wednesday, it was pretty crowded for a mid week with no particular occasion. After my 6 year old wanted to play transformers more than once, we regretted not taking VIP pass. You can spend a whole day here, if you have kids, get there early as they may get tired by lunch. We missed the water world ride as the line would take a week for our turn to come! Do try transformers game, Madagascar was nice for kids, Egyptian theme rides and dinosaur ride were more for adults.

review_348053969,“Loved it!”,"Been there 4 times ever since it opened. Each time was an experience. It is a must visit place in Singapore if you have not been to an universal theme park. Be prepared to queue if you visit during holidays. Tips:1. Buy your tickets online, if not you will be spending hours queuing for tickets.2. Be there early esp if you are going there during school holidays or weekends.3. Don't bring too many things to carry, for some rides you will not be allowed to carry things with you. You can use the locker provided at the entrance to store things but it will cost you money. ( I can't remeber how much) I believe there are lockers near some of the attractions but again it would cost you money. A pouch or a sling bag should be sufficient for you to carry around. 4. Buy the express ticket if you intend to experience all rides in one day.5. Food - vegetarian options are limited and not worth the money. Might want to pack a sandwich to go.

review_347501491,“Fun day out!”,"Visiting Universal was a must for my Singapore itinerary. I haven't been to any Universal parks before this one and i was not disappointed. The park is located on Sentosa island, so not on the main island, but is easy enough to get to - via either cable car (less waiting time) or the Sentosa express rail (very busy stations and cramped carts). The park has attractions to suit everyone including little kid safe and scary big person rollercoasters. We went mid week and that helped with less people queuing for rides but expect about 20mins wait time per ride. Around the time of the water shows, there is less wait time, however the Underwater Show is worth seeing. Universal is fun for everyone and don't worry about missing a souvenirs at one of the gift shops; there is some towards the exit that sell all the same gifts!!

review_347475914,“Heat & one grumpy staff..”,"To be fair, this is minor but it only takes one staff member to spoil one's good experience. ""Linda"" was operating the kids dinasour merry go round (the push button to lift the vehicle) on Tue 2 Feb2016. At about midday she became very agitated, yelled at a number of customers that we were in the wrong queue (even though it wasn't signposted And she assumed we understood mandarin!). She was clearly grumpy and affected by the heat, and wanted no more of the work. The replacement staff arrived to find that fat Linda had taken away the key for operating the machine! Another staff member had to run over to help. Bad staff like this need to identified and removed. I told a group of staff members and they all agreed that she was appalling in how she interacted with the other staff and customers!An obvious reminder to all foreign visitors, the heat and humidity in Singapore means that you have to be prepared to wear these typical climatic conditions when roaming this relatively small theme park. Research also on neighboring country school holidays. We completely overlooked the China school holiday to our detriment. These are my two tips that may not be so obvious elsewhere. Have fun!

Overall universal studio seems a fairly great place to go.Thus our decision to purchase the annual express pass for uss, however things took a spiral down turn from there. Upon entering, the usual upbeat friendly smiles from uss staff was missing, in place we found bored and slacking expressions on most of the staff faces, not even due to busy overcrowding, the park wasnt even that packed on a Friday, and average waiting time for most rides less than 30mins, so why are the staffs all so unmotivate in low spirits, apart from a few diligent staff from mummy and Jurassic park rides.Toilet maintenance could be much improved, floors are wet and smell terrible, especially the first one I went in next to entrance. Glattic rides can't be missed, it's an awesome ride, but the seats smells awful, it was so bad that the less than a minute ride caused me to vomit, not from thrill of ride, but because the safety harness straps were too smelly! Someone could at least give these seats a wipe a day for God's sake.Worse part was when we had to use the lockers at glattic rides and found a used tissue in our assigned locker?!Went Starbucks for a rest but couldn't because most of the tables are taken up by huge families without a single order on their table...Quite a speechless experienced considering the amount of money spent for membership and express pass.

Typically though we were on the very next 'loading' with barely a couple of minutes wait.

review_347079018,"“My escapist one-day holiday, three times a year”","I'm a frequent guest at Universal Studios Singapore (USS), and this was a monthly experience for me. I've been on every ride several times, and being a resident in Singapore I must say this is probably the best theme park experience we've ever had on the island. The best rides in my opinion (in order of personal preference) are: The Battlestar Galactica, Transformers, The Mummy, Jurassic Park's Rapids Ride, Puss in Boots, Jurassic Park Canopy Flyer, Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase, and Accelerator. The rest of the rides are pretty standard theme park fare, which kids may enjoy depending on the level of their endearment to the licensed characters. Note for travelers who've been to Universal Studios Orlando: The Transformers ride is an exact facsimile of the Universal Studios ride in Orlando, so you aren't missing anything if you've ridden that one before. Lights! Camera! Action! is a smaller version but worth a look. For the shows, Waterworld and Puss in Boots are top notch, and the Donkey Live Show and Shrek 4D can be a hit or miss, depending on the crowd that day. Food is decent for USS, and I think they put in more effort seeing the typical Asian's love for good food. Pizza at Loui's used to be above average, but has since declined in standard. The local fare at The Lost World's Discovery Food Court is decent but with turkey legs at nearly every corner and superb fried chicken at Goldilock's are far more deserving of your calorie quotas. Overall, I'd say this is a great treat for travelers to Singapore. Look out for Halloween Nights and the weekend parades too if the timing is right. Weather: be prepared for Singapore's hot, humid weather, with the not-uncommon showers. Temperatures can hit 35C in the open, so bring water (there are water coolers around the park) and dive into the air conditioned rooms where you can. Many of the queues are in open air (except for The Mummy and Transformers), so you might want to strategise queuing for the hot periods for these rides. If the food is not your fancy, there's a plenty of local fare just outside of the park, but you'll need a re-entry chop if you want to come back. Ideally, a full day will be required to comprehensively cover the park with some rests over meals, but if you don't want to rush it (especially if you have young children) do it over two days. Adventure Cove also makes for a great second day stop.

What they had that other theme parks did not have is the faster line although you need to pay extra. That was so worth it as we were able to go to most of the rides easily. The food were good but expensive. The bathrooms were clean and were found everywhere. The mascots/characters should stay longer for picture taking.

review_346422524,“Fun for the Kids!”,"We had a great couple of days at Universal Studios. My kids love going on the rides so most of our day was spent lining up. The lines we not that long, except for the most popular rides, which were about an hours wait. On our second day we purchased a front of line pass for $50 so the kids could go on their favorite rides without waiting too long. The only thing we found strange, was the Jurassic park section didn't open until 1 hour after the park opened. It was roped off and then by the time it was ready to be opened there were hundreds of people squashed together fighting their way in so they could get to the Jurassic Ride (I think the most popular at the park). It was really uncomfortable and we got trampled. Other than that it was a good day out.

Weekends and holidays are sure crowded better to schedule a trip on a weekday and off-peak season. It is better to book a 2-day ticket to get the most out of USS. Do not ever leave USS without going to the waterworld attraction. USS is not the best place for kids under 2 years old as they can't really appreciate much of this park; parents will just be stressed with them as the weather can be very warm and sunny.

review_346125438,“Awesome Entertainment Experience for all ages”,"If you're into fun and thrilling experience, try Universal Studios Singapore. Located in Sentosa Island, you can reach it via MRT (harbourfront station). Then take the Sentosa Express at Vivo City. Alight at waterfront station. You can buy the day pass ticket for $74 (adult) and $54 (child). Food and drinks are not allowed. But you can try bringing a bag with a sandwich and a bottle of water for snack because food is quite expensive inside. You can bring along a water bottle because there are water fountains inside the park, just refill 'em. Don't forget to bring a poncho (raincoat - you can buy at daiso japan store in vivo city. It will only cost you $2 at daiso and $4 in USS) as well because you might get wet in one of the attractions and it sometimes rains in the afternoon. You don't wanna get wet! You must bring an extra shirt in case of emergency too! Come early as there are lots of tourists and locals visiting the park especially on weekends! Outside USS are lots of restaurants, souvenir shops and cafes. Hope these infos can help!

The day we visited it was not particularly busy however the queues were horrendously slow.

review_346022786,“January Family Holiday 2016”,"Loved the whole concept of the park. So very different to the Sentosa we saw when we were last in Singapore in 1978. Children would love many aspects of the Universal Studios theme park but some of the rides would likely be too much for some and there are restrictions re height as well. The Universal Studios Sentosa website has a pdf you can download called the Riders Guide. Read it before purchasing any tickets as it will save you $ and also let you know in advance what your child/children will be able to go on and not. Whilst it is not the cheapest day out as far as prices for entry it is probably comparable to somewhere like Dreamworld all said and done.Whether you are buying tickets in advance or on the day and you absolutely hate long lengthy queues, then purchase the Express Pass as this will allow you to walk past those queues. Hubby and some others in our group waited 90 minutes to go on the Jurassic Park ride. Only after that did they realise they could go and buy the Express pass.My eldest daughter went on the zip line and loved it [I was supposed to go on it too, but prolapsed a disc in my back on Xmas Day so no rides for me :( ]Food is what I call standard fare for theme parks - it's okay but nothing to write home about.If we had more time we would have loved to go back and see the Trick Eye Museum and Underwater World and get around to see Siloso Beach area...maybe next time :)

Many of the restrictions can be found on the website and its really well worth the time to check it out... So heres what we know. The hotel booked our reservation at $74.. our kids were free 0 and 3... we arrived at Marina Bay Gardens and changed bus...Arriving at Universal we entered had a coffee etc at Starbucks and planned our Itinerary ... Baby age 5 months and boy aged 3.... queued 70 mins for first ride and found out you can but an express ticked $60.. PP.. You can use this once for each attraction, but given the mandatory hight restrictions 90% of the rides do not accept the express..!!!! had difficulty getting any hot water for our baby boy to make milk... The rides with the Express ticked had a waiting tome of 60+ mins causing problems with our 3 year old.... left early and TAXI requests were a nightmare...the attractions and street carnivals a disaster, as so crowded you could not see..Really adults great, but families with young kids BEWARE ITS NOT WORTH IT..

A majestic world one has always dreamt of and would never want to leave ! Undoubtedly assuming the heavy rush at this place , I would appreciate the arrangement of washrooms and drinking water are absolutely perfect and upto the mark . The washrooms are very neat and clean and I would rate them @ 5/5 for the maintenance ! But somehow I felt that the prices for water, food and other drinks were too high and not worth the quality and quantity as well !The beauty of universal is that it's a tourist friendly place and apt for all types of age groups ! The rides were great and daring as well ! Well, I would suggest the tourists to take a Universal Unlimited Express pass to cover the entire u overall studios without having standing and waiting in long queues ! We had a great time because we could manage to cover the entire area till 4pm and thereby we even repeated many rides and shows bcz of the unlimited express card ! Street shows are great fun to watch including the cartoon characters which keep on roaming about on the streets !

review_345520903,“A must visit in Singapore!! But pretty expensive during holiday season”,"Been at Universal Studios, Singapore during my Christmas vacation. Entry fee for an adult is SGD 70 and if anyone wants to pay for express pass (limited), pay additional SGD 70 and 90 for unlimited express pass. Unlimited express pass entitles the fun/thrill seekers to take the rides/shows multiple times. However, for few rides even express pass is not valid, everyone has to stand in a line which makes you feel being overcharged for the passes. Need one whole day to complete all the rides/shows at the studio. The best ones which I liked are:1) The Transformers2) The Galacia (the big rides)3) The Mummy4) Jurassic World5) The water show (specific show timings)During holiday season its recommended to visit the studio on a weekday rather than on weekend. The park charges might be lower on weekdays as compared to weekends.

The biggest surprise for me for the Transformers ride. I had heard that it was good but never expected it to be THIS good. I visited the place with my wife and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore. The food inside is priced reasonably well but the same cannot be said about the merchandise. A few points to note before you visit the place to make sure you have an enjoyable experience.1. Dedicate an entire day for the visit and reach early (10 am) - Anything less and you will miss out on a LOT2. If you aren't travelling with kids then USE the singe rider line - It will save you a LOT of time3. Do not carry a lot of things to lug around - Most rides have a free locker which you can make use of but then that just adds to the time4. The best rides in the park in the order of preference. Do NOT leave the park unless you have experienced all of them  - Transformers- The Ride - Battlestar Galactica - Cylon - Battlestar Galactica - Human - The Mummy ride (forgot what it was actually called) - Jurassic park - Rapids - Shrek 4D

review_345177835,“Good for a starter if you haven't been to other larger formats”,"Singapore is smaller than many cities in the world! And Sentosa Island.... smaller than many privately owned Ranches and Farms! Taking that into consideration, what they done with Universal Studios is not just commendable, its phenomenal! They have Rollers Coasters for all age groups, and much more. The best is the Cylon, a definite 'do not miss' thrill.A few important tips:1) Always lookout for online promotions. You might come across some excellent bargains with excellent freebies.2) Buy an express pass only. It will save you almost an hour per ride in case of good ones and 15-25 minutes in the ordinary rides. Don't worry if you bought an ordinary pass. You can top up with an Express Pass after entering too and dedicated stores inside too. They have Unlimited Express pass too wherein you can visit any ride for more than once.3) It will be tiring, exhausting and thrilling. Carry only what you can't live without. Less things to take care of, more you will enjoy.4) Align your time with various events and activities going around the place. They have something or the other going on for various age groups. Decide what suits your style!

review_344875850,“Universal Studios Singapura”,"For people visiting Singapore for holiday and specially with kids should visit Universal Studios. Please make sure to have ample time on you hands. It cannot be a half day visit. You should get in by 10:30. A universal express pass though expensive is worth the cost. Any ride or show would be less than 15 minutes wait .Else, all the important rides like Human and Cyclon would be at least 35-40 minutes wait time. Make sure that you have all the show times mapped out during the trip. Donkey Live is the best along with Water world. The S.E.A Aquarium is not so great so do not club that with Universal

review_344872883,“Love it sooooo much”,"This was really a massive highlight of our trip. It's an absolute must do if you are travelling to Singapore. The rides are soo good and have so much detail to it and it just creates an amazing experience that no one will forget. The food it good (mid - ranged) and the drinks average. The top 3 rides are Cyclon, Transformers, Revenge of the Mummy. Watch Waterworld as well. If you wanna get wet sit on the blue seats for EXTRA fun. Express passes are available but we didn't need it and got to all the rides we wanted to and got to do the popular rides twice!Just a great experience

review_344703895,“Fun day out!”,"We visited on a Saturday, and after reading reviews were weary that there would be long lines, but we managed to bypass most of these without having to fork out the extra money for express passes. We arrived at Sentosa at about 9.40 and found cheap tickets for sale at the Harbourfront end of the boardwalk which was a lovely surprise (although this seemed like a temporary thing). We entered the park as it opened and went straight to the more popular rides like Transformers and The Mummy, before making our way to the Jurassic Park rides which don't open until 11. We then made our way through the Far Far Away Land, Madagascar and Hollywood sections which tended to have shorter lines. We spent the middle part of the day and early afternoon watching shows and street performers, before going back to the rides where the lines had started to shorten. Food was ridiculously overpriced, but what more can you expect from an amusement park? Overall it was a fun day out, although it would be nice if they had a few more rides.

review_344687772,“Fun for kids of all ages ”,"We spent a whole day at this theme park and thoroughly enjoyed the rides, sights and sounds. The park is well laid out and easy to navigate. There are plenty of places to eat and drink and most of the restaurants are halal certified. The Cylon and revenge of the mummy are highly recommended rides. Lockers are available before the more serious rides and are recommended. Do carry some cash though to unlock the locker if you are returning after the initial free period has expired. Be prepared to wait in long queues and like elsewhere in Singapore, dress for hot and humid conditions.

review_344660070,“Too crowded for enjoyment ”,"I've been to universal studios a couple of times. The rides and food were good. Rides had a relatively big range for both young and old and all well maintained. For the food there is also a range which is a tad overpriced compared to what u see in some other theme parks (Disney land in Tokyo for example). However, what really put me off from visiting again (at least not any time soon) was my one experience when we went over a public holiday. The queues had reach 5 hours for battle star Galaxy which is a ridiculous time to wait for a ride. Not to mention the fast pass queue (it costs double the price to get the pass - unlike Disney which is free) was also 2.5 hours long. The theme park could have easily avoided this by not selling anymore tickets. They were also not open about the wait times or when the rides would close. Apparently, the ride would resume once the fireworks ended and this meant u could wait inside even though on paper it says the rides all stop earlier than that. I'm just surprised for the amount they charge, they stop the rides so early. Theme parks like Disneyland in Tokyo which costs about the same stays open till 10pm and rides go on all the way till then. Maybe universal should consider the same especially if they want to let heaps of people enter the park and not exercise any control there. Ruined my what could have been good experience at universal.

When you sit down and the ride starts, it's fast compared to others who is slow at the beginning. There are many loops for sure and it has a STEAM that will surprise you which is a big deal for me.

By the time we stayed in the queues we weren't able to visit all the attractions. There are 2 amazing roller coasters but the issue is if you are going in the normal queue without the express pass there is a nearly 2 hour waiting time (Which we simply couldn't bother to wait). There are some excellent attractions and some not so amusing ones as well for instance we waited in the queue for the Puss in Boots ride which was so not worth the time.

At first the queues were okay as it wasn't as busy but the later it got the worse the queues got. We looked into buying a fast track ticket but they were asking for $80 each, which is well over what we paid for the ticket. When going on the the fast rides you have to put your bags in the lockers you get 45minutes free then after that it's $4 for 20minutes over. Complete rip off! Also don't trust the queue times quoted either, we got quoted 15 minutes and we are waiting over an hour. The rides are good but not good enough to queue all day and spend all your money on lockers.

Due to i'm alone ,i had requested your staff to help me to offload my 2 bag which was hung to the stroller and she agreed to help me to offload my bag. While i was squatting down infront of the stroller to unseat my baby(1 yr old) from my stroller, tragic things happen. Tthe stroller had fallback due to the heavy weight of the bag which resulted my baby was hurt by the stroller belt and your staff who had promised to help me was now where gone!It was a terrible mistake make by me which i trust in good faith of your staff that will render her help. Pardon me for raising my voice to your staff WAN, but as a parent, if things happen due to you had comply the theme park rules, how will you react when your child being hurt?I requested WAN to bring my baby girl to your in house first aid to seek for medical needs there where i receive humilating treament from your inhouse nurse by the name of Lemuall. Lemuall had informed there no problem with my baby leg no swollen and no crying, he had revert me to go hosiptal to check for xray. I told him if he diagnosed no problem, i requested him to write a note, but he rejected.i had ask Lemuall who going to take responsibility since he had informed there is no problem with my baby, he even challenge me i can write to your company legal team to seek compensation.To make things short, inside the medical centre there a few staff by the name of Maria (operation manager of Pantages Hollywood Theater,) WAN (staff from Pantages Hollywood Theater), Lemuall (in house nurse),Haja (customer service represetative),Maria had ask me what had happen and the condition of my baby, i ask Lemuall to relate to Maria.Below is the conversation between my and Lemuall Lemuall: Can your baby speak or stand? There nothing wrong with her leg since her leg is not swollen or cryingMe: Mind you, my baby only 12 months old, how she able to speak or stand?Lemuall: I have 8 kids, my kids is able to stand and speak at this age.Is this how your train your in house nurse to ask patients or baby when they need medical attention?When having conversation with Maria, it seem all your staff are sided to your workers. It's really a disgrace to knew all your staff who i mention merely push the responsibilty when accident happen and yet no help is render, this is extremly dissapointing and shame on you guys!Last note, if you are a parent who is taking care a toddler alone, how will you feel? Prior when this accident happen, i had when to your jarassic park restaurant. Stroller was not allowed , but i had requested your staff to help me to offload my bag ,it was a breeze for me to take my lunch alone. rdgsMatthew

We pre-purchased VIP tickets to enjoy the full experience of the park without waiting in the endless queues for the rides & shows. Although expensive, we don't regret our decision. We had a wonderful guide, Cheryl, who couldn't do enough for us. On the day we went, we were the only two on her VIP list for the tour, so we were very fortunate to be able to choose between which rides we wanted to experience. We were always given front row seats without waiting in any lines. For people who have been to Universal Studios in California, don't expect to find the one in Singapore the same. It is not a working movie studio as the latter and therefore much much smaller in comparison. Nevertheless it is worth a visit.

Lucky we bough the tickets from the hotel we don't have to line up at the gate. They just let too many people in at one time. The ratio of people in the park need to be smaller number for everyone to enjoy. It's seem ridiculous paid $175 for family ticket just to walk around the park...

For adults, Universal studio has rides like Transformers, Mummy, Jurassic Park rides, Cyclone (Blue) & Human (red) roller coaster rides. Out of these Cyclone was awesome and scary. To take these rides, you need to put your all stuff in lockers which are available there and these lockers are free of cost for few minutes then chargeable to 4 SGD or more. Other than rides there are many shows out which I like water show (near to Jurassic park). For kids, Far Far away, Madagascar, space ride and many other attractions are available. Ticket cost is 74 SGD (to enter and all rides are free) but google it and you'll find online price @ 54 SGD approx. Also you check universal express ticket to kill the long 'Q' Line (which is worth spending more money on this ticket) as this ticket will allow you to enter via VIP line. I'm not sure on price for this ticket.

There are two kinds of express pass. limited which gives you 1 express per ride on any given day ($S30) or unlimited ($S50). it is $50 well spent..2: If you get there early (9am-ish), you may be selected as ""The first Family"". This is a promo where you get taken in in advance of the crowds then get to open the park. They also give you a photo or two of you doing it and a bundle of express passes. .Also: Kids smaller than 120cm cant ride the mummy ride. The american diner is great food.

review_343139848,“Express pass is a MUST”,"Visited d studio almost a week ago, I can't stress more; you can save on buying the discounted tickets from a travel agent, but make sure you buy the EXPRESS pass from outside the studio else you will be spending 95% of your time standing in the queue. And yes try to not visit d Park during school holidays as it is chaotic during that time. There is food court in every theme park inside the studio, if you have d express pass you can visit most if not all d rides inside d studio with time in between to watch the shows.One whole day can easily be spent in d studio enjoying if you have the express pass, especially for family with children.

review_342804062,“Good fun on Sentosa”,"Went here on a local holiday so it was very busy on the monorail and at the resort particularly as we didn't pre-book so we had quite a wait to get tickets. We also would have purchased express tickets which allowed people to go straight to the front of the queues. Some of the wait times were up to 120 minutes particularly on the more popular rides. The whole experience is good fun although not quite to the US scale in terms of rides and entertainment, however still good for this area and there is plenty to do nearby.We had a fair bit of rain, however there was a lot of shelter.Food we felt was more varied just outside the park and you could get your hand stamped to allow a return to enable this.Plenty of water is available FOC which helped during the queuing.We did experience a couple of occasions were people queued for 40+ mins only to be turned away as their children were under ride height, so watch out as you enter the ride.

review_342741284,"“Great safe,clean experience!”","Nothing needs to be written about universal studios, am sure. However, would like to add a few tips here. It was a fun experience, of course. Fortunately, we had taken the express pass and did not have to wait anywhere for more than 7 to 8 mins. This is another 50 SD, however, certainly worth it if you are going during peak season. Those who have issues with height can avoid the revenge of the mummy experience also, as it is pretty close to a roller coaster feeling. Carry enough water and if you have a kid, take a pram along. Use the pre-loaded MRT cards at Singapore, so that you can use the same for the sentosa ride as well....again you save on time

My favorite attractions are Transformers, Revenge of the Mummy and Water World.If you are going to Water World, get ready to be wet. Bring raincoat because they are spraying water and even throwing pail of water in the audience. If you dont want to get wet, go to the higher/upper box seats.It's best if you have extra clothes, even underwear and pants. There are free drinking fountains around the area, just bring water bottles or tumbler. The queuing line is much shorter during weekdays. I really enjoyed this place even though we are walking all day and falling in line up to an hour. 1 day pass is not enough if your really want to experience all the rides.

review_342499911,“One whole Day of Fun!”,"Before we went to USS, me and my wife made a little research through the internet on do's and don'ts for a maximum fun.First, avoid the weekends/Public holiday (if possible).. Although you'll miss the parades & fireworks (Saturday only). But still, we went there Saturday!Buy tickets online for time saving (maybe there's special discount). Wear shoes, since there are some attractions that can make you wet from head to toe, and also you can run to your next attraction. Park is open at 10am, so go early. Don't forget to take the map and the schedule at the park entrance (it is free).We ride our (we're 29 y/o couple) favorite attractions first. (there are 7 different Stations). Suggested Rides (in chronological order):0. Entrance: Universal Studio Globe1. The Lost World: Canopy Flyer (flying vehicle)2. The Lost World: Jurassic Park Rapid Adventures (river raft)3. The Lost World: Water World (live water/stunt show)4. Ancient Egypt: Revenge of the Mummy (extreme roller roaster)Lunch time at Discovery food court (The Lost World)4a. Sci-fi City: Battlestar Galactica both Human or Cylon Track (sad that these rides are closed when we visited, but they reopened last July 2015)5.New York: Lights Camera Action (movie set)6. Madagascar: A Crate Adventure (Kiddy boat ride)7. Far Far Away: Sherk 4D Adventure (cinema 4D)8. Far Far Away: Enchanted Airway (junior roller coaster)9. Hollywood: Parade of the cartoon characters!!! (bring your camera)After all the rides, we've returned to EACH ONE of the Station for photo/selfie opportunity.Dinner at Marty's Casa de Wild (Madagascar)...wait for some time...rest.End the night with Fireworks display near our dining table.Buy Souvenirs.Tip: If you want to skip regular queues, buy Universal Express or Universal Express Unlimited.

review_342491236,“To do things in Universal Studio Singapore for adults and kids”,"Visited Universal Studio on Jan 13,2016. We visited on weekday but still there were long line at every ride. Waited 2 hours for Transformer ride, but the wait was worth. It rained intermittently on that day so they kept on closing roller coaster ride. But we managed to do one roller coaster at least. As soon as you enter studio, there might be a feeling of ""now what to do?"". So let me try to put in simple terms. Just take right and head straight to transformer, as it is going to be long wait with time. Kids are allowed, but smaller kids like 2-3 year old may get frightened, so better go with older kids say 6-7 years.If you are with kids, just take left when you enter studio and head straight to Madagascar ride. In front of Madagascar there is a light ride for every age of kid. then a little ahead, there is ""far far away land"". Enjoy 4D movies there and then move to Jurassic Park. There is boat riding and small roller coaster for kids. There is minimum height required , i think 0.90m for boat ride. Same is required at Madagascar. So smaller kids, 2-3 years, really had nothing to do in Universal Studio.So if you are adult, take ""Right"" turn as you enter, with kids take ""Left"" turn.

When they opened it, I felt like a kid, how excited I was. Everything was so amazing! I tried to play almost games, but after that I went to Egypt town. I kept my bag in locker and I was so careless. I didn't ask the man there clearly. So when I finished this game, I didn't take my bag back. I came to sci fi city to play game. I waited more 90 mins. Coz there were so many people here. After I finish this game, I came back to Egypt town to take my bag. And the locker didn't work out. I asked the man who kept lockers. He stared at me look like I was a criminal. He asked me: "" where was I come from?"" When he knew I was from Vietnam. He scolded me in front of everyone. This was my fault, I had to pay 12S $ to take my bag.

Although it is about 3 x the cost of a standard entry ticket it enabled us to numerous privleges including no waiting in lines for rides, air-conditioned viewing rooms for shows and meal vouchers for all. It would have taken us 3 x as long to cover what we did in the time had we not had without VIP access and if your not the type to stand in lines, this is a no-brainer.The whole group had a wonderful, completely stress free day and this rates as one of the best investments I made in a long time.

They dont smile, they dont get into the spirit or theme and it kinda puts you off. The cashier in the gift shop didnt even say a word to me once. At the Fairy God Mother's potion shop we queued to get a juice, only to get to told that it was closed when we got to the counter (wasnt even 5 yet).

review_342038517,“Excellent rides let down by poor crowd management and guest services”,"After we arrived I joined the line to get tickets for Universal studios as we have our SIA passes which we show to get free tickets to all of the attractions. I had the passes out in front of me all through the line but got to the front 20 minutes later to be told that those ones have to be done at guest services, another line. A sign would have been nice. We had planned our time to get there early to try to get the big rides done first but ended up getting in about half an hour after it opened.Dallas and Megan went to do the Battlestar Galactica rollercoaster and Reid and I joined the line for Transformers. We agreed to meet about 75 mins later. The estimated wait time had just hit 40 mins which was about my limit. We ended up in line for 52 mins and it would have been longer if not for the fact that they were looking for 2 people to fill a carriage. The ride was excellent - 3D movies interspersed with a moving car and lots of special effects. It took five minutes. By the time we got out it was too late to do another ride as it was just about time to meet Dallas and Megan. When they arrived we learned that they had managed to get 3 rides in. We stayed together for the rest of the day and saw the waterworld show, did a few tame family rides and did the sound stage show which was pretty awesome. It rained quite heavily at one point and cover was extremely sparse outside of the central areas. We hung out under a tree for a bit and then ran for it and found an indoor show. For an attraction in a place where it rains a lot, it is not well set up for rain.I can't help comparing Universal to Disneyworld. The rides are good but the waiting areas are not very well done. I was really annoyed that they do not have wifi as we had no way to communicate with each other and had to arrange meeting points and times which wasted a lot of time. For the amount of money that they charge to get in they should be doing things like wifi to make life easier for guests. Coming from Vietnam where every hole-in-the-wall cafe has wifi, I have been somewhat disappointed in Singapore in this regard. I also thought the express pass system was not well designed and caused a lot of delays to people who did not have them. It is clearly a money making venture rather than any sort of attempt to manage the crowds. The disney fast pass system is far better.

You can only use the pass once per ride but it means you can go on every single ride! The Rollercoaster, Mummy and Transformer rides were our favourites.

review_341535196,“My 1st trip to universal studios Singapore.”,"Universal studios Singapore exceeded my expectations. I went in thinking it will be an exact replica of the one in L. A but it turned out to be better than the US one. It's quite big so ideally you need min 2 days (more if you've young kids which we did). You've to keep Singapore's weather in mind and if like me you're not used to humidity then plz make sure you have plenty of water on you (preferably electrolyte water) as it can be draining on not just the little ones but adults alike. The wait time for some of the rides was very long and with a not yet 4 year old it was very difficult to wait in the heat. If they could aircondiiton the waiting area it would be much better. You must wear comfortable shoes as all you do is walk and stand. There are plenty of eateries but as usual like all theme parks you can't bring your own and the food is way over priced and pretty unhealthy. In the Singapore heat all you want to do is eat watermelons and other hydrating fruits but I didn't find a single fruit stall:/ weather wise I don't think there is a best time to visit this Plc as we went 2 weeks ago which is supposedly winter but it was beyond hot and humid. In terms of avoiding the crowds the best thing would be to buy the more expensive express ticket which makes you avoid the lines slightly. I didn't know about it and will definitely buy one for next time. There are a lot of rides that are unsuitable for little ones due to age/height restrictions. If you've really young kids I would suggest waiting a few years otherwise it will be a waste. My personal favourite was the transformers ride which is exactly the same as the US one. A must for all the fans and non-fans:) the ""waterworld"" performance was probably the best stunt performance I have seen in any of such parks. I would definitely recommend this theme park if you can brave the heat and humidity then go for it and have a blast;)

review_341488962,“Fabulous place to take the children”,"We travelled as a family (grandparents, 3 adults & 3 children) and went to universal studios for granddaughters 12th birthday. We all had a lot of fun with excellent rides, shows and 4 d movies. The place is spotlessly clean and very organised when lining up for rides. We arrived early when the park opened so the queues were short, they did increase in the afternoon when there were more people there. We all had a wonderful day young and old.

All the cartoon character I have seen in my childhood, I can have a picture with them. There is so many things,exciting Rides,Memorising shows, Dance shows by local artists and so much. Felt like I am in a different world, I don't wanna go home. For kids its a paradise. Bit costly but worth it.

All kinds of set created for all age groups. It is very well made, maintained. The roller coaster rides are phenomenal for those who love the adrenaline rush.... The ""Transformers"" ride a MUST for all. The real size Bumble bee and Optimus Prime, one cant miss for anything.

Unfortunately Battlestar Galactica wasnt operational when we visited but I am sure its worth the rush! Avoid weekends to cut the local crowd.

Initially we thought it might be hard to cover the place but it is so well managed and facilitated that you'll never know how time goes by. The rides are first class with some of them topping my all time favourite rides list (Transformers Ride and Revenge of the Mummy - DONT MISS!).

review_341098578,“Good for family holiday”,"Well, it's universal studios! A bit pricey, but offer many attractions for all family member (except for under 5 yo I suppose).We went here on saturday 9 Jan 2016. We took MRT from esplanade st. to Vivo, but then the queue of Sentosa Express was so long even in 10am. We decided to take bus just outside vivo instead.All of attractions here were well maintained, with street performances here and there to add more fun. Spent whole day here. We can guess which attraction suit for which family member, except for Transformers (really not for little kids!). In afternoon the weather could get hot so don't forget to bring caps.There are many restaurant inside but the food was average. Tips: if you travel with family and stay in area near, like marina or orchard, you'd want to consider to take a cab instead of using public transport. The price difference is not significant plus you get there fast hassle free, maximizing your holiday.

The park makes it convenient for all rides with safe storage for bags available throughout. Phototaking spots are quite creative. Shows were interesting and interactive, but I think they were more for children. The queues can be devastatingly long, so I suggest going on weekdays. I bought a season pass, so I go to USS very often. The rollercoasters still hook me in, but for people like me the other rides might become redundant.

review_340917788,"“Two times now, and won’t be a third”","I’ve been to Universal Studios Sentosa twice now, both times with my three kids. My first visit was back in 2011 and more recently in November 2015. And both times I really didn’t enjoy it.I love theme parks, and have visited many Disney parks around the world, and also rate the theme parks on Queensland’s Gold Coast quite highly. But Universal Studios just doesn’t cut the mustard.Firstly, there are too many dud rides (like the terrible and outdated Madagascar Ride :O). And then there are just the inexplicable attractions taking up space (like the rock climbing at Jurassic Park). And then there are restrictions on many, many rides that prevented my (tall-for-his-age) 7 year old from enjoying his day. To top it all off, the queues were horrendous both times I visited.And, like I said… I love theme parks so don’t object to queues. But the ride-design should be smart enough to handle the crowds, and these rides are largely just poorly designed.The undoubted highlight was the Transformer Ride… it was extremely clever, totally unique and bizarrely thrilling.

While there are really only 2 roller coasters for the thrill seekers out there, there are still plenty of rides and shows to keep yOu entertained throughout the day. I loved the transformers ride, as well as puss in boots and the mummy (even though the mummy ride broke down and we were stuck for about an hour in the queue). Food prices at Universal were not too expensive so I was pleasantly surprised. One tip I do have when you are going on the mummy or the battle star galactica coasters is to take at least $6 with you in your pocket, as you need to put your belongings in a locker and if you exceed the free period you will need to pay to open the locker again - which is very difficult if all of your money is inside it.

We enquired and found out that the studio had half year pass available then, costed us around 100 dollars each. Since, we were there in Singapore for 10 days, if we had visited the studio even just twice, the pass had given us better value compare to buying any other type of tickets. You would not believe, we visited the studio four times during that visit, certainly, not for the whole day every time, but for a few hours each time and did most of the rides, including ride the movie, etc. Note: The food is very expensive in the studio. We went outside for a little while and had lunch in the food court, just next to the universal studio and then went back into the attraction.

review_340335771,“One full day ! ”,"This was our first visit to universal studios and it was amazing! My kid was 11 months old when we were there.There were seven zones one after the other . We entered at Madagascar as we had kids with us. We took two rides.King Julian's beach party-go-round : This had no restriction. A mild ride (merry go round ) and my kid enjoyed this a lot. Madagascar - A crate adventure : This had a height restriction and my kid was not allowed here. So we went separately. It was a boat-ride with Madagascar characters all over the ride. Far far away :The only thing we saw here was shrek 4D adventure . The quality of 4D movie was awesome. Lost world :There were 4 rides here but we picked two as we had to take turns for rides to take care of our little one. Canopy flyer : This ride was good . Our legs hanging down, we take a speed ride in an open rider. Nothing to be afraid about this. We do not feel any giddiness. Jurassic park rapid adventure : This is a water ride . We go by in six-seater tubes . Tube goes in a small canal all through. Some special effects for some time with lights off and dinosaur sounds . At the end, we will be taken to certain height and there will be a sudden drop (not to be so afraid though) . Scifi city:Transformers ride : Best of all the rides in universal studios. We sat in a car like thing which is called evac. The plot goes like this. Optimus prime tries to protect us from decepticons . Decepticons try to damage evac and kill us. This is a 3D ride and we see all the characters through out the ride. We didn't feel the ups and downs in the evac as we were thrilled by the concept. There was another roller coaster too which was under construction in October 2014.We met some characters of transformers live on the streets. We took photographs with Optimus prime, a huge transformer .Ancient Egypt:Revenge of the mummy : This was a dark ride with so many turns. It was the dangerous ride of all. They click a picture of us inside the ride . Not recommended for patients and pregnants and small children . There was a ride called treasure hunters too! But we didn't do it. New York :Lights, camera , action : Its a fabulous show presented by The world famous director Steven Spielberg . He made a brilliant attempt to exhibit the real action behind the screen.Hollywood:Sesame Street: We took our kid here. It was a train ride with animations of sphagetti and characters. It was pleasant. Mels Dinettes: Splendid dance performance by the group.When we were done with all this, we had a surprise waiting on the streets: CHARLIE CHAPLIN . Yeah and he was splendid! We clicked pictures with him. Note : Avoid weekends as it is very crowded. You can take express pass to directly go without any waiting . It costs extra 20$ for all the rides.

Since I brought my 3 kids (11yo - 10yo - 7yo) so I've made a little research through the internet on do's and don'ts for a maximum fun. And as I experienced it myself, I'd like to share it with you all.* It is more comfortable to go there when the peak season is over. And if possible, go there on weekdays. Avoid weekends, although you'll miss the parades & fireworks that only appears on Saturday.* Buy tickets online for time saving and sometimes you can get special discount.* Wear comfortable clothes since it is very hot & humid. Buckled sandals are better than loose sandals or shoes, since there are some attractions that can make you wet from head to toe.* Go there as soon as the park is open at 10am.* Don't forget to take the map and the schedule at the park entrance, so you won't miss the show & character meet & greet. The schedule is different from time to time.* Rides the favorite attractions first: Transformers, Battlestar Galactica (Human or Cylon), Revenge of the Mummy, Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure, Waterworld (show). As for me and my kids, first we ride Transformers at Sci-Fi City. Although it's already low season but the queuing time still takes about 40 minutes. But the ride was worth it!* If you want to skip regular queues, buy Universal Express or Universal Express Unlimited.* Drink lots of water to stay hydrated.* Stay at nearby hotels at Sentosa if you want to spend a lot of time visiting most of attractions at Resort World Sentosa (Universal Studio, S.E.A Aquarium, Adventure Cove Waterpark, Trick Eye Museum, Madame Tussaud, etc) for time & energy saving.

A great example is the Jurassic park Water ride. The Jurassic park ride compared to any other log flume ride in the world is so much more entertaining, exciting and extravagant.

review_339858487,“Great Theme Park for the Family”,"Situated at the Sentosa Entertainment Complex, getting to the Universal Studios was a breeze. Be warned, leaving Sentosa Island at peak hours can mean waiting at the taxi stand for a long time!Even though the park itself is rather compact, it is much better organised than a lot of the other ones in Asia. The different areas are well marked, and one can cut through some of them easily (especially when travelling with your children, or when the weather turns foul).The rides are suited for all ages with some height restrictions imposed on the faster/scarier ones. If you can afford it or travelling with young children, go for the Fast Pass, the money is well worth it.

review_339823848,“Great day out”,"We arranged a one way transfer and tickets to Universal Studios at home before we left for Singapore. There was plenty to see and do. Even though we had a very wet day there, apart from the big roller coaster rides, we found most things were under cover and we still enjoyed the day immensely. We had a crate adventure which was a river boat ride with Alex Marty, Gloria, and Melvin. My daughter and Husband took the Puss In Boots’ Giant Journey suspended coaster ride and even though they got saturated (due to the rain) loved it. We walk down the Hollywood Boulevard and browsed through the stores. We also enjoyed the 4D Shrek Movie Adventure. We left by taxi and even though there was a long queue, it was very orderly and taxis came quite frequently. We took the short drive to Vivo City ( A hugh Shopping Centre) which you can easily walk to from Sentosa Island. There was also the MTR (Train) or Bus that could have been taken. We had a great day out.

review_339804748,“Ok not great”,"Took my 7 and 10 year old boys. I thought the basic ticket prices were quite reasonable but the express ticket prices were $150 for the 3 of us. Expensive ! But... There was no way I wanted to spend an hour queuing for a 5 minute ride. Anyway it turns out that neither of the boys wanted to go on any roller coasters or do the transformers ride but even the less exciting rides had long queues. There was one ride that looked good in Jurassic park that we could not use it for so was disappointed and so we didn't bother as the queue was 30 mins. Other than that park was smaller than I expected, and had less rides than I expected and I certainly would not go to a theme park again. Waterworld show almost made up for the expense- it was excellent !!!

review_339804377,“A great day out!”,"We only had one full day in Singapore and my husband and I decided to hit up Universal Studios to round off our trip in Asia. It was great fun! Tickets were $74 Singapore dollars +$50 Singapore dollars for the universal express pass, which lets you skip rides an unlimited amount of times (as opposed to the express pass for $30 which lets you skip queues once per ride). Despite being the quiet period (January, once everyone is back at work and school), we found the universal express pass well worth the extra money. The best rides of the park are Transformers 4D ride (by far!), the Cyclone half of the BattleStar Galactica roller coaster, the Mummy Crate ride (although don't waste your life queuing up for the Mummy ""Treasure Hunt"" ride!) and the Jurassic Park rapid river ride. All were good fun! The food at Universals Studio was average but I guess that's normal at theme parks. A good day of fun! Getting there is really easy but a bit of a walk from the train station.

For few rides the waiting time is around 1 hour which is tiring but once you take ride the feeling goes away quickly.One has the option for quick rides with a VIP ticket which costs more.

review_339778631,“Nothing overly special”,"This is colloquially known as Asia's #1 theme park - which it probably is - although some peoples' views may differ. It is a super small park and you should be able to go on just about every ride in as little as 3 hours on an off peak day. The park is great for solo travelers as you don't have to wait as long on some rides and won't need a pass to jump the queue.There are only a couple of thrill rides and roller coasters for those thrill seekers and is probably a more family oriented park. The best roller coaster is the blue Battlestar Galactica ride. The Jurassic Park Rapids would have to be one of the best rapid rides you have gone on, it is themed well and you almost feel you're in the movies. The Mummy ride is really exciting - although quite short in duration - and the Transformers ride definitely wakes you up. You get a great view of Singapore and the docks from the new Puss and Boots ride, but the ride itself isn't the worst but is more for younger families, same with the Jurassic Park sky way. The Madagascar boat ride is also great for young children, and the little Shrek roller coaster too.Like just about every theme park in the world, it is not smart to come here on peak days, as cues for rides can be longer than an hour and you will only end up going on 4 rides for the whole day. Even the access pass to jump the queue can be long, but obviously not as long so if you do go when it is holidays it is wise to get the pass. Overall, Universal Singapore isn't too cheap (around $70 Singapore dollar) considering its size and number of thrill rides. But if you like theme parks it still good to go but you probably wouldn't rush back once you have been. So, nothing overly special, recommend coming on an off peak day and personally I wouldn't even consider going during School Holidays.

review_339774385,“Don't go without the express pass”,"This place is great for family and friends. The atmosphere from when you enter the gate is excitement and that's what i got most out of the visit. Even though it was a rainy day, the staff were helpful and all the rides were open. Having said that, there is at least an hour wait for all rides. Going without the express pass is madness if you don't value your time. Most of the big boys rides were an hour and a half wait and only go for less than a 60 seconds. All in all great positive experience but definitely would not feel the same if i had paid for just a standard ticket.

review_339526444,“Second best theme park in Asia”,"I would definitely recommend this park to all families because of how easy it is to move around the theme park and the rides are much more thought out and creative in terms of the themes used the ride. A great example is the Jurassic park Water ride. The Jurassic park ride compared to any other log flume ride in the world is so much more entertaining, exciting and extravagant. The rides in general are much more unique. We went there at the start of this year and the lines didn't have that long of a wait time. I do recommend you get the superpass to avoid massive lines. The eating places are quite good too. If I compared it to my favorite theme park in Asia which is Disneyland Japan, I would say Universal Studios is much better for families since it isn't too big and has better eating places.

review_339524879,“Great family fun”,"So the rides might not be up to the same level of thrills as Universal in Orlando (that said, my boys loved the blue Battlestar Glactica one!) and it might be a fraction of the size, but there's still a lot of fun to be had at USS. Having just one day here we invested in the Unlimited Express passes which allowed the boys to continuously by pass the queues for the main roller coaster and make the most of their day. Also recommend the water show. If you don't have an express pass and love your roller coasters arrive before opening and head straight for the Battlestar Galactica ride or risk very long wait times. We came mid week when crowds weren't too bad but it can apparently get very busy on the weekends.

review_339513836,“Great park – but way too popular”,"We visited on the last day of the year – along with what seemed a million other people. With queues for rides averaging 90 minutes plus – we felt we had no choice but to purchase Express Passes for everyone, costing another $70 each on top of the admission price. This felt like a rip off, but at least it allowed us to complete all the rides by the end of the day. When we were there, it looked unlikely that anyone could do this without buying one. Apart from all the people, we had a good time. If we had decided not to get Express Passes, we would have spent hours waiting in long lines and left very disappointed.

My kid enjoyed so much meeting up all his fav characters like minions, Santa Claus, Madagascar cast, Shrek & Fiona & Pinocchio, Dinosaurs and his most favourite Bumble Bee & Optimus Prime. There were long queues for most rides so we couldn't do all. You can spend the entire day here and you wouldn't know where the day went! The rides and the theme parks are amazing as are the stunt and special effects shows. Try to see as much as possible and take a map and the meeting schedule of the characters to plan accordingly. If you buy the Express tickets, you may be able to do all rides but not with toddlers or elderly. Food options are ample and each food court is made according to the theme park you are at which is fantastic. It rains quite suddenly here so be prepared.

RWS tries every trick in the book to extract more money out of you. On rides where you can't take a bag because it will get wet or fall off they make you pay $4 to rent a locker for an hour. If you've already spent over $200 bringing your family into the park I would expect this to be complimentary.Also, on the Jurassic Park ride they make a big deal out of telling you that you will get wet - not everybody does. They then sell you overpriced plastic macs which they then throw away. It would be very simple for them to save all of this non biodegradable plastic being sent into land fill. They could allow people to reuse them for free. Rather than save its customers money and do a little something to reduce their impact on the environment , RWS would rather make a fast buck out of customers who have already paid a small fortune for a day out.

I would advise you to buy the premium unlimited pass which costs approximately as much as the ticket but gives you access to queue jump.

Otherwise queueing time is about an hour on the popular rides. Universal studio is a paradise for thrill seekers. Attractions such as transformers are excellent, with outstanding special effects.

All manner of photographic accessories can be purchased there; however, if you harbour outlandish thoughts of photographing much more than the boulevard itself or the sky above you may well be disappointed. From the outset, humourless employees became animated at my attempts to capture the faces of my excited children even though we were only queueing for the Madagascar ride! ""No video. No video!"" Pecuniary advantage may be par for the course when theme parks are being considered but Universal Studios, Singapore not only managed this but threw in monumental servings of officiousness too. If it wasn't bad enough being rebuked for unavoidably aiming a lens in the direction of the attractions, one particularly miserable individual even took umbrage at the fact that we were consuming a pack of chips which weren't purchased within the confines of Universal's shakedown juggernaut. $11 for a hotdog? Despite the theme park's appalling prices and the niggardly approach of some of it's employees, my children thoroughly enjoyed themselves. My son was particularly keen to enjoy Transformers: The Ride and he'd been looking forward to it for months. Sadly, it broke down barely two minutes into the fun and we had to trek across the tracks and exit through the bowels of the building. Still, at least we were extended the courtesy of a verbal apology in a rare outing of Universal good manners.

review_338503900,“Fun but not for the whole family”,"USS is fun for bigger kids and adults. It's not quite advisable to go if you have a younger child since the child won't be able to go on most of the rides and you can't really leave them behind alone. Lines are really long so if you have the budget for it, splurge for the Express Pass so you can maximize the experience.

Could not do it all in a day though as we were with seniors. Best show:Waterworld do not miss! Best rides:1. Cyclone Rollercoaster blue track2. Transformers3. Revenge of the mummy4. Canopy flyerOthers:1. Shrek 4d was super! 2. Madagascar crate adventure3. Donkey live was OK would pass especially if queue. Decent Indian vegetarian options at oasis restaurant in the Egyptian zone opposite revenge of the mummy. Best overall attraction in singapore for us! Can get decent discounted prices via some agents rather than online or at attraction venue. We used cebu air travels and tours at lucky Plaza Orchard Road and saved a fair bit.

review_338301565,“Awesome fun; Awful waiting time”,"This is a really fun place, if you go on a day you dont expect crowd. We went there on Christmas day and were greeted with a crowd like i had never seen before. All the great rides had a waiting time of more than 70 mins. Others still had longer waiting times than you would like. Because of the waiting, one misses out on character meet and greets etc that is going on outside.Now , transformers is a fantastic ride and one with huge waiting times. Similarly battlestar galactica is a great ride with a big waiting problem.The solution to the problem? go to the park on a working day and reach there early. By early I mean as early as 9:30 - 10:00 AM. Apart from queues, it is a place where the fantasies of a fanboy /fangirl come true. For that, it is worth the wait !!

One complete day from early morning to late evening is required and preferably one should visit on a weekday as local visitors are very frequent. One can take a MRT to waterfront and can walk down for appx.10-15 min on the deck which also has a good view.If you are traveling alone with small children then make sure you have someone who can take care of them for few minutes as there are few rides which you should not miss where small children are not allowed and someone would be required. if you are couple traveling then you can go alternatively but don't miss the rides.

They told us it will be 70 minutes for the queue so we didn't buy the express pass (then it took 140 minutes!!!)Roller coaster (the blue one) is the best ride in the park and is amazing. Totally recommended.If you can buy your ticket from a tour/travel agency you can get some discounts (we bought the ticket at about 50 SGD instead of 70 SGD)Buy some meal vouchers as well (we bought 4 meal vouchers at 2 SGD each, with the value of 5 SGD for each voucher). Food is not cheap there so each person would need at least 2 or 3 vouchers (10 or 15 SGD)It was hot and humid but we explored the park and it's beautiful.

We got there by taxi, and from Bugis it cost around S$12-20. The theme park is not that big, you can finish it in one day specially if there are no lines in major attractions. For us best seller is the 'Transformer the ride', a 3D ride, line usually takes 15-30mins. Other attraction that we enjoyed are Sesame street show, Lights, camera, action a hollywood movie set up, Shrek, River cruise, Madagascar, Water world and the new one Puss in Boots giant which we did not have the chance to ride cause its raining that time. The rest are basic rides which you can find in other theme parks like carousel or train ride. The place is highly recommended as it was one of singapores tourist attraction.

review_337662773,“the whole family loved it”,"We had a wonderful time at universal studios. I would recommend that you find out before going if your smallest child is 120cm or over, as this is the minimum hight for a lot of rides. Also our day would not have been as good if we didn't purchase ultimate fast pass tickets. They are an additional 75 SGD on top of your ticket per person, but the lines (if we didn't have it) had minimum of an hour waiting time, to go on them once. We just walked in and the longest we had to wait was 3.5 minutes and we could go on the same ride multiple times. It made the day fun, and the children (4,7,18) and us oldies had a happy, carefree, non stressful day, and we got to see everything and go on everything, which wouldn't have happened if we had to line up.We were really suprised, if you wanted your photo taken with a character, the professional photographer took a photo (to sell you) and also asked you if you would like them to take a photo for you with your own camera. The day was not expensive (other than tickets and ultimate fast pass tickets, which you can purchase online in advance). Great full day of fun!! PS: you can also get normal fast pass tickets for an extra $50 p.p (on top of entry ticket) this allows you 1 fast track to each ride.

A perfect place for photography and do take along your selfie stands with camera or mobile batteries fully charged and if possible also take along Power Banks. Has numerous food courts including Halal Food. Drinking water is not an issue in Singapore as Tap Water is drinkable, just take along water bottles and water chillers are installed all around.

Otherwise, the rest of the rides were suitable for children and family for a weekend getaway. There were many food kiosks and restaurants that are great for chilling if you have ran out of rides. My only rant is that the photo-taking session is pretty limited with each mascot coming out only about 20 minutes. Hence, you have to plan your time well if you want to take photos with them.Understood from the staff that the after 5pm promotion has ended, hence its advisable to just get the annual/half year pass to re-enter any time.

The first time I visited was in early November and although I had made a list of the must do rides and also the order in which I was going to do them, I ended up missing the Donkey live and water world show and also the mummy ride. I did not anticipate a lot of crowd and so I did not purchase express passes beforehand. After waiting for 40 mins early in the day for the Jurrassic Rapid ride, I decided to purchase the express pass. Unfortunately after lunch the crowds can get heavy even in express queues. Even with the express pass for the second half of the day, I was not able to complete all the rides. During my second visit on Dec 26th, I purchased the express pass in advance and started in the express queues for all rides and I was able to finish all of them - I rode some of them twice - the mummy and the transformers. I followed a TripAdvisor user wicaxon's suggestions - rode in the same order as suggested in the review. The ratings given to the rides in the review are also spot on. We traveled as a couple. If you are travelling with young children, there may only be a few rides for the kids - which is also mentioned in the review.Here is the user Wicaxon's review with suggestions: https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294264-d2439664-r151083155-Universal_Studios_Singapore-Sentosa_Island.htmlHere are some suggestions to get the best out of your trip:1) if you are traveling as a couple or with friends and you want to ride on all the attractions, get an express pass.2) arrive ahead of time - by 9:30 a.m. The monorail queues at VivoCity may be long on holidays. On 26th Dec there was a 1 hr wait time to board the mono rail to Sentosa. Skip the monorail - you can take a cab from HarbourFront station for 4$ to Sentosa.3) USS is normally open from 10 to 6. But in the holiday season - Christmas/New Year, it is open from 10 a.m to 9.30 p.m. on select days. If you are visiting in the holiday season, make sure you watch out for this window. It gives you so much more time to enjoy at the park. Plus they have some Christmas special shows for kids in the holiday season. If you are looking to visit Sentosa in the holiday season, please do. We were initially skeptical about visiting during the holiday season fearing the huge crowds - but there is an additional 3.5 hrs for you to ride the attractions and there are extra runs of the staged shows during this time. The day we visited -26th Dec 2015 - the park was crowded, but still We got to ride all the attractions- every single one of them including even the kidsmerry-go-round :)4) follow the link to a another user's review above and take the rides and shows in that order. Plan your big roller coasters earlier in the day and do the staged shows - Shrek 4D, Water World and Steven Speilberg show - after lunch. 5) immediately after you enter the park, grab hold of a map and a pamphlet with show times for the staged shows. Some of these shows run once every hour - Shrek 4D, Sesame Street - while others have specific show times. So, at the start of your day at USS, plan your timings for these shows. 6) don't waste time taking photographs with Disney characters and at the different theme locations early in the day - that is unless you don't want to ride on any attractions. The photo-ops are available all throughout the day and you can do them after lunch.The tickets to USS are quite expensive at $74 for an adult plus a 50$ for express. So, plan well the attractions you want to ride and the order in which you are going to do them. I regretted not planning thoroughly the first time where 74$ + 50$ almost went down the drain. It is quite a small place and you can do it all in a day if you plan well in advance.Here's the order we took:1) Jurrassic Rapids ride2) Human3) Cylon4) TransformersLunch5) Shrek 4D6) Steven Speilberg Lights Camera Action7) Revenge of the Mummy8) Puss in boots ride9) Water world at 4.30 p.m10) Enchanted airways11) Madagascar crate ride12) Accelerator13) Transformers 2nd time14) Mummy 2nd time15) King julien's carousel 16) Canopy ride17) Dino soarinEateries:We tried oasis cafe at Egypt-theme (Indian food) - not great but not badThere are ice cream/ ice lolly and juice stalls all over the park.What to wear and what to carry:Wear comfortable loose clothing as the temperatures can be quite high in the afternoon. bring an umbrella. It was quite hot the day we went and we were walking with the umbrella from one attraction to the other. Bring a cap and a pair of sunglasses. Wear running shoes - you may have to walk around a lot. Don't wear them to your Rapids ride, though. They may get wet. You will get wet in Jurrassic rapid ride - carry a poncho or buy one for 2$ before you join the queue. The poncho machines near the queues only take 1$ or 2$ coins.You can bring packed food from outside/home. There are no restrictions about what you can carry in terms of food. We took a few cereal bars and a water bottle. There are drinking water kiosks all over the park. You need not carry a lot of water with you.Lockers: the lockers outside ""mummy"" ride were free for the first 45 mins. Reach early to get hold of one of those.

review_337114608,“Excellent day”,"My family and I went on 29 December and it was extremely busy with most lines over an hour but we had the fast pass which is really worth the money. The Transformers ride was amazing and I think the best ride in the park. It is worth bundling the Universal trip as part of a package with other attractions in Singapore like the aquarium or waterpark. We did this and it saved a family of 5 over 200.

review_337094578,"“Good, no need to get there early”","The island is pretty far but you can get there early by bus. They kinda stick it to you with a 4 dollar ticket to rise the monorail otherwise you can walk almost 1.5 km which is kinda far. The park itself is very clean and charges the usually high amusement park rates but that's to be expected of any amusement park. You can see the whole thing and ride almost every ride in about five hours. The lines aren't that long especially as it gets on in the day but that may just be the very early January season. It's a good park to visit but eat before and wait to eat again until after

If you go during holiday season, it is best to pay extra for the express lines, or else you'd have to wait a lot for each ride. I made a mistake by not doing that.

review_336907651,“After 5pm visit to UniversalStudios”,"It was Santa's All-star Christmas event and I went with 2 other friends who wanted to sit the rides. There was lots of entertaining stuff to do for even people like me who didn't like roller coasters. We went for Transformer which was a 3D simulator ride first. The queue was about 40 mins for single riders and double that for the group. After that, we went on 3 other rides and ended the day around 8:30pm. The special thing about going during Christmas is that the rides open until 9pm. After being exhausted with all the adrenaline, we went shopping along Main Street and bought souvenirs. It felt like I was a kid again. Totally enjoyed it!

Was able to get on all the rides we wanted to even though we did not have the fast track pass. Maximum wait was for the Transformer ride and the Cylon ride around 1 hour all the other rides where much less.

review_336706704,“extremely busy and definitely need to pay the extra $90 for unlimited express lines”,"Went 1st January expecting crowds to be down - not likely as it was very vey busy. Some rides between 45' and 1 hr + unless you had an express pass. Brought grandkids express passes so that they got to enjoy many rides over the day and had a great experience. Factor in paying the admission charge ($74) plus the express pass of $90 per person otherwise you will spend most of the day in lines and queues.. The experience was great not as good as Universal Studios in Orlando, but still well worth the trip - note January is the wet season and it should rain at some stage during the day. For 1st time I hired an electric wheelchair ($50) - (wife needs one) and found it great, besides saving your legs, you always has a seat - recommend it no matter what age you are.

Having visited Disneyland in Florida we knew what to expect from this sort of theme park - and we were right. Big queues and expensive food but also loads of fun.

review_336587821,"“Good day out with kids, get an Express pass but expect queues!”","Fun attraction in Sentosa - 10/15 minute taxi ride from the city. It's not a huge park, so you can get in and out in 4-5 hours if you plan your day. In my opinion it's worth getting an Express pass add on for $50-$70 per adult (not required for kids), as in most instances this saved us anywhere from 30-75 minutes per ride on our visit (Saturday, New Years long weekend). If you don't want to pay the extra, then make sure you are at the park around 9:30/9:45 (in advance of the 10am opening), and plan your day so you head to the popular rides first when queues are short (Revenge of the Mummy, Enchanted Airways, Battlestar) and then to Lost World (Jurassic Park Rapids, Canopy Flyer) when that section opens at 11am. Plenty of food outlets - as well as beer! Do your research if you have young kids - a lot of rides have height restrictions which can be found on the website. Fun day, do your prep, and make the most of your time so you can enjoy the rest of it. And dress well for walking, and getting wet on a lot of the rides!

review_336559217,“Mind blowing place!”,"A must visit place, tourist spot for everyone!As soon as you reach Universal Studios, right from clicking pic infront of rotating Universal Globe at the start to the Hollywood Boulevard, you immediately are sold to the eye catching American style architecture. Light-Camera-Action is a must show. Other theatrics shows are also good.Mummy ride and Transformer ride elevates the mood and you would want to do it multiple times. An express pass in worth the money. It is costly but you would know the importance after you experience the difference - a 2 hours queue versus an immediate to 10 mins wait for ride with an express park, especially on weekends and PH.Human and Cylons are two giant roller coaster ride. Cylon will give you pure adrenaline rush and is the best ride of the park, though I tried it after lot of pushing by friends.Far Far East Castle and 4D Shrek show are treat to eyes. Kids would enjoy it. Madagascar and Carousel are two other rides were family along with smaller aged kids would enjoy.Their are few eatery options also including for vegetarians. You get Tea as well at Oasis restaurant.Better to go with group of friends if couples having kids want to do rides together.This is surely the most adventurous places in Singapore.

Would not encourage to go if you are not going with kids as the visit could be rather tense having to rush for shows and entry is always given to people who purchased priority pass, they do not have separate queue, thus even they come half an hour later than you, they still get in first and if your turn and quota full for show, you would still gain no entry.

review_336113056,“Hyped up place”,"Went around Halloween. There were many shows or buildings closed maybe due to renovation or maybe because they want to take a break and open at night. There is a crowd as I was there in the late morning. Do go in the afternoon or evenings when the weather is cooler. There aren't any rides suitable for seniors except the Madagascar ride. They had a great team taking care of the seniors in my family.There were queues everywhere and not much place to sit and rest in the shade. This is a waste-money place. Everywhere you go, there are kiosks and canteens charging very much expensive prices for everything. Bring your sunglasses, umbrella, portable stool, sandwiches, juices so that you can have a break under the shade. I would recommend not going at all if you have seniors. Save the money and don't spend your money at all for the tickets to this scam.

review_336113045,"“If you want to ""test"" your patience then this is the place to go!”","Totally over rated... queues everywhere for everything! Length of queues went from 35 mins to 3 hours for the sought after attractions! (most queues seemed to be around 2 hours) So even through we arrived at opening time, by 6pm we'd only managed to get on 4 rides! Of course there are the express tickets but these are upwards of $70 a ride so makes it a super pricey day if you wish to go that way. The rides that we did do were short and compared to Universal in the USA a real disappointment. We won't be coming back and if we are ever in Sentosa again we'd opt to do specific activities like IFly, etc where you have a specific time. I appreciate this was likely the worst time to go but they need to limit entry to the park to make it more enjoyable.

review_336103726,“Amazing rides - good shows”,"USS is a full day of fun and rides. The place has something for all age groups.Avoid holiday season and weekends if you can because it gets really crowded and some of the rides could have a waiting time of upto 2 hours (or you could buy the Universal Express Ticket to cut through the lines, HOWEVER, I think the Universal Express does not help you on the 4/5 high speed roller coasters where the wait times are higher).Travel light - ladies avoid carrying handbags... on some roller coasters you will have put away the bags in the lockers. There are 4 in the park... most are chargeable. the ones in Ancient Egypt are not for a certain time period (~45 minutes) ;-)I loved the ""Far Far Away"" the most. There is also a ""Waterworld show"" there are 3 shows every day. DO NOT MISS THE WATERWORLD SHOW.On the rides, revenge of the mummies in ancient egypt, canopy flyer in lost world, puss the boots in far far away and inter galactic rides are not to be missed. the blue inter-galactic is not for the faint hearted. watch the ride before you board the blue one.

review_335899991,“Not a must do at all”,"Really disappointing experience. This park is small but well laid out however it cannot seem to cope efficiently with the volume of people!!! Lines were ridiculously long - waited for blue roller coaster for over 2 hours! If you can afford an express ticket I would suggest you do so however we were quoted $70 per express ticket for a one time ride on each ride or $90 per express ticket for unlimited. As a family of 4 in addition to the $300 admission price, it simply was not affordable at all. Be warned of many people pushing in and cutting the queue - I had enough and told one of the staff and they made them go to the back of the line. Another queue jumper and while staff member had a go at them, they still managed to get on before us - very unfair considering we are all waiting a very long time.We got there just before 10am and headed straight for the Transformer ride - we waited 1.5 hours as the ride 'had technical difficulties' (how this happens so early and how this wasn't detected prior to opening I do not understand). The ride was enjoyable and probably our favourite. We left at 5pm and had only managed to get on 3 rides. Very disappointing and I feel ripped off. One ride (the red roller coaster) had a wait time of 145 minutes!!!! While we went on a fine (albeit very hot day) - be advised if the weather is rainy - the outdoor rides will not operate.We caught the MRT to Harbour Front and then caught the monorail ($4 return) from Vivocity level 3 to Sentosa. Depending on the time you leave, the line to wait to leave Sentosa for the monorail can exceed 30 minutes and when you have been waiting all day - it just makes you further annoyed.If you are short on time, give this a miss - plenty of other wonderful, more affordable places to go in Singapore.

As with other US parks, Transformers, The Mummy and the Jurassic Park Rapids are quality productions. Human and Cylon are good thrillseeking coasters but more adventurous riders will be left with not much else to do. Express passes are worth the extra cost during peak periods. Wait turns are around a quarter of the normal queue.

review_335388399,“Full day of fun”,"We arrived early and made a full day of it. We decided to purchase Express Passes when we entered the park. As the day progressed we agreed that the additional cost was well worth it! Top recommendations:- Arrive at the park early (before the gates open). There will be a long queue. We (group of four) travelled by taxi to and from Sentosa. If you stay at the park until closing time, prepare yourself for a long queue at the taxi rank. - Consider purchasing an Express Pass. Ride wait times can be reduced dramatically. - Take snacks/ packed meal and a water bottle. The food within the park zones are themed. The 'cuisine' that you feel like eating may be on the other side of the park when meal times come along. There are places to fill up your bottle. - Check out the show times, and plan your day around these. - Our favourite rides included: The Mummy, Transformers, Battlestar Galactica, and the water ride in The Lost World zone (we got soaking wet on this ride!). I would recommend purchasing one of the ponchos, or taking this ride early in the day on a sunny day so that have time to dry off. The Steven Spielberg special effects demo (I've forgotten the name) was insightful. - Utilise the lockers provided as you progress through the park. You will need coins. - Make some time to wander the streets of Hollywood. Enjoy!

review_335161812,"“LONG lines without express tickets, very disappointing”","We are amusement park fans, and were really looking forward to a day at Universal Studios - Singapore. The park was impressively laid out, and the decorations for Christmas were wonderful. However, on our very first ride, Transformers: The Ride, after waiting for over 30 minutes, we were told that there was a delay, and after another 15 minutes, they closed the ride. Luckily, my husband asked for express tickets so we could avoid the long lines when it repopened. About 45 minutes later, we waited 40 minutes for Jurassic Park Rapids and the same thing happened! At least this time, the ride started up again after 15 minutes, but really, two rides out of the first few rides we rode on?! The wait times for the rides were crazy long. Some rides offered single riders, which was a good idea, but not all of them, which was crazy. Express line people got in very quickly, but for us, we probably averaged 50-55 minutes per ride. It definitely takes away the enjoyment of an amusement park when all you do is wait for a two minute ride, many of which were let downs. However, when we returned to the Transformers ride, we got on in about 10 minutes, which was awesome, and the ride was a blast! If we could have done that on all the rides, our experience would have been so much different. The park brochure offered one tip for getting on rides faster: buy an express ticket!! It was such a let down. The tickets weren't cheap, so adding the extra cost of express tickets just wasn't in the cards. We had it by 6:00 pm, and then had to wait another 30 minutes for a taxi back to your hotel!!! Lines, lines, lines.

review_335129150,“Poor Staff Training and Profits above Welfare”,"I've been to USS twice and both times witnessed very poor staff attitude. The host/hostess all have glum faces as if they were forced to work and I saw them shouting/barking at guests who did not queue according to their instructions. Management should walk around or do under-cover surveillance. Is labour crunch so tight that USS Singapore have to employ part-time students with little training or QC? The experience from the staff at the F1 or the Sports Hub is so different, everyone there smiling and eager to help.On my second visit, it was a packed Friday so we paid $50 for the Express Pass, but the Express Passes were sold in an uncontrolled manner so even the Express queues were about 45 minutes to an hour even though the announcements were that it's 5 to 15 minutes. The estimated queue timings (for both Express and non-Express queues) are always grossly understated.The fact that USS chose to adopt the useless NEA Lightning Warning System also heaps further misery on the queuing time, and I queued for an hour (Express Pass) only to learn the Battlestar Galactica Ride will be closed due to LWS. Now, NEA started this LWS nonsense and say it is up to vendors to follow, but with such a system in place, vendor cannot not follow because of legal ramifications. But do exercise common sense, the LWS is too conservative and have a 99.999999999% false alarm rate. On that day when they close the ride I was about to board, there is no rain or lightning anywhere near RWS, but NEA being over-cautiously put up a 'lightning forecast icon' within 8 km radius of USS, and hence, the ride was closed. How stupid is that!!Anyway, on days where the queues exceed a certain timing, express passes and new walk-in admissions should be stopped. Don't just think of profits. Leave the profit-making to the Casino and do not, in any way, spoil the fun of those who come to USS for the fun. And please stop following the LWS, use your own professional judgement to decide on Lightning Risk.

review_334977067,“Just Awesome”,"This is probably the best amusement park in whole Asia. There is a section devoted to each of the major movie series by Universal, and each of them is great. Almost all the rides are awesome. Definitely worth the money spent. Express pass is not required though.

review_334951189,“Wonderful experience”,"We had a good time. We had been in the peak season and on a Monday.Egyptian Mummy, Transformers and Jurassic park were my favourites among all. I had been to similar rides, but, this was by far the best.Among other rides were Madagascar, Canopy, water world etc.I also loved the shows of Shrek and Steven Spielberg hurricane show. It's a good timeout place with family or friends. Tips:1. 1 day may not be enough to cover all. Plan our prioritize accordingly2. On a rush day when expected guest count is high, priority ticket is advisable. For 10-15min ride, wait time is from 45 mins to 90 mins in normal queue

review_334902102,“An adventurous trip”,"Last Sunday we had a family trip to universal studios at sentosa. The first thing I learnt was avoid Sunday's or opt for universal express ticket in addition to admission ticket.Every ride was so crowded as it was school holiday time. But as it was festive time universal studios were open till 9pm with all rides. There was a Christmas fireworks at 9.30 pm which continue everyday till Dec 30th,2015.Since we went with our little girl, the first ride was Madagascar boat ride. Good .Next was a carousel which last for just 1min.So highly disappointed. Next was Far Far away.Don't miss the puss in the boots and enchanted airways.The shrek 3d adventure and donkey show was lovely. Try to sit at last as they are moving seats.Next was lost world. Don't miss the canopy flyer, Rapid adventure and dinosarin. Revenge of the mummy is great but children must be at least 122cm to ride.Next was sci fi city, Transformers we totally loved it. Terrific. Then you Steven Spielberg's light camera action, great. Next was Sesame street space world. Don't miss the battle star galactica, we did not ride as my girl was not allowed.Do check the universal studios website where they have a separate file about height requirement for each ride and conditions. So you can plan your ride before you go. Since it was open till 9pm my girl enjoyed the rides many times. Catch a glimpse at Madaonna in Hollywood. We also enjoyed the Christmas dance show at 9pm. In the end it turned out be an awesome day.

review_334874677,“Best Place to Be in East Asia”,"Universal Studios were the only thing missing in the tiny but precious island of Singapora! There are 12 rides that are matchless. If you are solo or in an odd number group, take the advantage of the Single Rider and you skip the often-long queue for the rides. Don't miss the visit to the studios. Hold your camera tight -where it is allowed- as the experience is shocking. Outside foods and drinks are not allowed. And the quality of the food there is not better than any other theme park in the world. Spare a full day for the park. Seeing Sentoza itself is another adventure so do not combine your Universal Studio adventure with anything else in the same day.

review_334855134,“magical fireworks”,"it is my third time visiting USS and here are some tips based on my observations if you want to plan well:1. if you can, avoid peak periods in June, December, public holidays and weekends.2. if #1 cannot be met, i suggest getting an Express pass which entitles you to priority queues for the rides. the queue time during peak period can be from 30-90 mins after which they will accept no new riders until the queue is cleared.i have been to USS w/o express pass during a weekend and on Halloween night, as well as with an express pass during christmas wk. personally i felt that the express pass saved me a lot of stress and boredom from long queues and waiting. it can be very pressuring to rush from ride to ride so that you can cover the entire park within a visit and i realised i experienced less fatigue with an express pass. walking and taking rides are fun and doesn't consume much energy, but waiting and queuing actually makes you tired coupled with the pressure of limited time.3. of course the express pass doesnt come cheap but it buys you time and convenience. if you are unwilling to pay and have to visit during peak period, then here is a compromised option: visit USS at 10am sharp. the rides have nearly zero -15 mins wait time from 10-1130am. conquer these essential rides and be quick: transformers, the mummy, jurassic park rapids. make sure you finish these rides first before proceeding to the next series which are less exciting but still gd: canopy flyer, enchanted airways, puss in bootsafter which you can spend the afternoon queueing for the other rides and shows.4. bring a poncho if you dont want to get wet during the lost world rapid ride.5. purchase your tickets online.-----------------------other views:i really enjoyed the xmas fireworks, it was magical. :)

review_334745921,“Christmas day visit”,"So, this time I will write the review just with the summary of most important tips for travelers before and during visit:-If planning to spend christmas day at Singapore, Universal Studios will be a great and different way if want to experience something different away from the traditional western experience, but do not expect to see Santa, after all remember that that this is Singapore so Christmas is not a big event here-Plan to buy tickets in advaced to skip lines, some agencies like Asia Travel or even Mastercard will offer discounts of up to 10 SD-Plan to arrive as early as 9:30 this should be enough to pick up tickets and look around get familiar with the area and enter at 10:00-December is a highly rainy month so bring a poncho or something to cover or you can just purchase before the main gate, you will need it either for the day or some rides-Not sure about the express pass??? in my experience if you arrive early, you are not in a rush, only want to ride probably once the main rides and plan to spend the whole day, then don't buy, all day is enough to ride them all once but plan to spend from 15 up to 70 minutes on the line-Now, you are with kids, planning to hit the rides more that once, only have half day, don't want to wait more than 30 min max or less per ride and no money constrains then I highly recommend to buy the pass, it will be a big difference and your kids and wife will appreciate, I know that some people say that the single rider option brings you similar advantages but I'm today here and there are really not too many rides with this option so pass is ahead of this, of course will be extra money but again, family will appreciate-Even now still with doubt, don't worry I saw that some vendors are selling the pass inside at same cost 70SD, so you can evaluate once inside, I saw that the vendor in front of the Canopy Flyer had some-Food, yes overpriced vs street but normal for this kind of places, so no sorprises here, anyway plan to bring snacks to munch between meals and then have lumh or dinner at some locationHope this helps, nice vacations!

review_334723786,“If you've experienced another universal studios - put your money on something else”,"If you've ever visited any given universal studios berfore and aren't accompanied by kids, this one isn't worth the high entrance price. For thrillerseekers you've got 3 attractions and if you're in it for 4D movies you have 2 of those attractions. It's kinda small, you would do the park in 5-6 hrs (still; I don't speak for those with kids). To get to Sentosa you could take Sentosa express, but I wouldn't. For those of us with good legs it's a 10 min to walk the boardwalk which lies nicely along the water. It's 1$ instead of 4$ with Sentosa express (which is also very crowded sometimes with up to 1 hrs waiting in line)Also! BUY YOUR ENTRANCE TICKETS BEFORE REACHING USS. There are several places to do it. I bought mine in a ticket booth on the boardwalk and I'm glad I did. It was only one in front of me, compared to a massive long queue at USS entrance :-)Transformers attraction is the best attraction, don't miss out of it.If you're traveling alone or are in a company who wouldn't mind splitting up, you can save some time standing in singel riders queue. Instead of queueing 80min it took me 15 for Jurassic rafting for example. You do need to ask the staff at the entrance of the attraction to let you in.Anyways. I spent some good hrs in the park. The shows were the best! Enjoy your visit.

review_334694378,“An amazing day long activity ”,"Universal Studios Singapore is a great replica of the original in Los Angeles, with the convenience of just a few hours flight away from majority of the world, unlike the 16 hours+ long flights one has to take to get to USA.We went on a Tuesday and being holiday season, there was a big rush. It is all but natural for people to begin the day from Madagascar and go in an anti clock wise in zones. That's possibly the reason all rides have long waiting queues. I bought the universal express ticket that was more expensive than the main ticket at Sgd 70 but it was worth it. Worth it because it was very warm and humid and if you have kids and short on time and temper then the express ticket is a must. The Madagascar and Far Far Away are excellent for small kids. Afterwards it's a drag for them but all in all its a very good theme park. You can easily and efficiently do your park in one day. We also saw the all stars Santa Christmas show at 7.20 pm. It was quite good. All in all, it is for sure an excellent venue to spend your time with the family. Keep extra clothes with you if you have kids.

review_334547321,"“Amazing experience, great fun, but insanely crowded”","Great holiday spot for families, couples and groups of friends. They have attractions to cater for all ages and it promises hours of entertainment.Pros:-- wide selection of rides, attractions, events to cater for all types of visitors- great showmanship by the actors and good service from the staffCons:-- expect overpriced F&B- Not many places for parents with young children and seniors to rest when tired (seating benches were few and it can be quite humid given the climate)- crowd on weekends and holidays can be of epic proportionsI came to check out the Halloween horror night event because I have heard so much about it year on year. I was not disappointed the least bit. It was great fun, and the staff handled the crazy sized crowd professionally.Just be mindful that on special occasions and weekends, the crowd is tremendous and getting on to rides may require you to queue for 30 minutes to 2 hours per ride. If you are coming for the rides, you may want to invest in an express pass to let you cut the queue a little. To give you an idea of what I mean, during my visit, the queue to the haunted house was estimated to be 200 minutes long. The express pass I had put me in the priority queue which was only 20 minutes long. While some may shy away from the cost of the express pass, given the temperature and climate of Singapore in general, I am not keen to wait in hours in a crowd of people.You may also want to bring a spare change of tee shirts to slip into after your visit.After all that has been said and done, I can't wait for next year's Halloween event to see what they cook up next!

review_334529002,“Best to come mid-week”,"The crowd here over the weekend can be crazy. The wait for rides can be anywhere between 40-90 minutes! If you're not too fussed about splitting up from your group when on the rides, you can opt for the single rider queue, which is a LOT faster. What happens is you get slotted into single seats to ensure the ride is full. This way, you get to enjoy the ride a lot faster without having to sweat it out in the long queue. They do sell tickets for priority queuing (single ride or unlimited), but these are quite pricey. Best time to come here would be on a Tuesday or Wednesday. Some of the notable rides are Transformers, Puss in Boots and The Mummy. Of course there’s the Battlestar Gallactica ride, but it looked way too scary (but was a crowd favourite, based on the average 80 minutes waiting time). This is a great place to come to with family and friends. Best to arrive here at 10am when the park opens and make a full day of it.

review_334401366,“Not a place to visit if you have toddlers not able to sit by him or herself”,"We visited this place on a Sunday in Dec 2015. The place was packed with people, average waiting time for most of the exciting rides were 40 to 60 mins long. Not wanting to wait so long as we have young kids, we purchased the express ticket at $50 each. This is in addition to the admission ticket of $74 per adult. The express ticket is good for all rides except two: treasure hunters and canopy flyer. We brought two kids, age 3.5 years and 16 months. The little one gets scared easily so she would not leave my lap. Hence she is termed a hand-held infant and does not qualify for all the rides at universal studios except the carousel located at madagascar. Yes, all the rides refused her because she will not sit by herself, including the mini ferris wheel aka ""magic potion spin"" located inside a gift shop. So for the entire trip, I was babysitting my ""hand-held infant"" because of the reason stated above. Not a lot of fun since it was so hot in the sun, and there were indoor seating provided. Would not recommend USS to families with kids under 2 years old.

review_334350482,“Fraking Great day”,"Universal is located in Sentosa which is where most of the leisure parks including the beach, can be found. Getting here from Marina bay was easy using a taxi which costs under SGD20. Generally taxis are quite a good way to go around Singapore if travelling long distances with a group. The star of the rides is Battlestar Galactica with two choices as human or Cylon. Personally I preferred Cylon which had more complicated turns, a loop and also going through some mist. With Cylon your legs are dangling while you rest your feet on the Human. We paid extra a for the express so had one token for each ride. I would say the extra for express is worth it as we cut out the long que's that would have added an extra 30 minutes.Other rides included the Jurasic world which included a water ride which will drench you, a tree top ride that was a bit too slow, the dragon airline at the shrek area which was great fun, the mummy's revenge which was mostly in the dark but was exilerating, a special effects show which was good for anyone in a wheelchair, a transformers ride which is a 3D show which was OK. One ride that was very dull was the Madagascar water ride.. It did not seem to reflect the song.. ""I like to move it""Rides that are NOT present are Indiana Jones and Back to the future which is a real shame. This would have been awesome for the adults.There are regular shows at the different areas with live performers dressed up to entertain. Kids will be particularly amused by the shows and rides.The food stalls were a standard affair of burgers, fish and chips and wraps.

On the third floor we joined a long queue simply to get tickets for the Sentosa Express, there were only four people selling tickets and for some bizarre reason there were no ticket machines to be seen! At the entry gate they are very strict about you not taking in any food. Once inside there seemed to be too few staff on some of the rides meaning things were not as swift/efficient as they could be.Small changes would lead to big improvements.

The good thing about the attraction is that they have a balanced range of indoor and outdoor rides. Hence, if it rains, you could still enjoy some of the indoor rides there. Visitors should plan their route before visiting this attraction to maximise their time here. If it rains, you can always go to the indoor rides like the Transformers Ride, Sesame Street Ride or experience the musical performance at one of the theatres there. They are currently playing a Sesame Street Christmas musical. I would really recommend that visitors do their research and find out the timing for street performances and appearances made by the USS characters like Beetlejuice, Minions, Madagascar and Sesame Street characters, etc. It's an opportune time to really get close and take a photo with the characters. Variety of halal food in various interestingly-themed restaurants. Food is tasty but like many similar attractions, could be quite pricey for budget travellers. There's a comfortable prayer room for those planning to spend the whole day at USS. It's near to the Egyptian-themed attraction. Just one suggestion to make about the staff in USS. Although they may be quite efficient and professional, I think it would be great if they could exhibit more warmth and cheerfulness when interacting with visitors there. We've been to themed parks overseas like Korea, Japan & Hong Kong where we saw more smiles on their faces and really getting into the spirit of a theme park. Nevertheless, that did not dampen our enthusiasm experiencing the rides and atmosphere in USS.

review_333719314,“Among the list to explore in Singapore this was on the top.”,"On the top of list. Why? Because, the most expensive attraction on sentosa is an amusement park!! This notion always bugs me as in my opinion amusement parks are a place for kids and teens. There is nothing much for an young adult to do there other than to supervise them. Also, I am a nature lover and love to walk trails and climb up the highlands or, dive into the Sea etc. so an amusement park doesn't spark the bomb of adventure as to explore any such activity.However, Since many of my friends having already visited and telling me good about the place, I chose to visit it with my better half to spend some leisure time.I reached the venue late and started even late but in a pattern suggested by my colleague and on his suggestion to not to miss any of the rides and to cover them first.I started from Sci-Fi zone, heading towards the most hyped 'Transformers Evac Ride'. I respect the movies series but after being told that waiting time for ride is 1 Hour or more. The only thing I cursed was the popularity of the movies which I supposed was the reason behind so much wait. I kept the expectations grounded and started to test my patience after exact 1 hour and 10 minutes we were in-front to ride on the Evac. Everything seem mysterious as along the whole wait time visitors are addressed as recruits of NEST team and are briefed about a mission which seems to be similar to the incident when all spark has been attempted to burgled by 'decepticons' and mission objective is to foil this attempt.& then... the ride finally started to unveil what is there to feel. You are put in the mid of the situation with Evac to witness the near real 4D fight scenes. It was like a rugby match on going between Autobots and Decepticons with ball being the All spark. I felt it very much exciting because I didn't expected something like this. At the end of ride I made a decision to visit USS again not for any other ride but for Transformers.We then headed towards Battlestar Galactica 'Human' as my wife rejected going to 'Cylon'. The rollercoaster is nice but here also I had to wait for almost less than an hour to get the chance and I was continuously p****ed off by excessive shouting by some lady commander while trying in vain to fill fear in riders. IMO, this was nothing compared to the excitement filled in by transformer ride.We headed to Mummy's ride, which was damn dark but was better than Galactica Human (next time i'll go on Cylon to see if that is better)Then we covered Jurassic world to end our time of visit. The little rides remaining were not worth my explaining here.Please take this writeup as my personal opinion.Good Luck with your visit.

We leisurely strolled though New York getting on the rides that we wanted to do more than most.We didn't have to queue no more than 15minutes for the 4 big rides we wanted to go on.In saying that there are heaps more.Once we had completed the big 4 We visited each themed area and spent a good length of time in all, taking in more rides and attractions.Had completed in 6 hrs, we had showers during our visit but it didn't dampen our mood.Was a fantastic day, loved it.

review_333600240,“Loved it!!”,"Visited USS in November with our 2 young children (6yrs & 2yrs), and had an amazing time. Purchased the express passes which were worth it. No longer than 5mins wait for rides which is a huge deal when traveling with kids, most lines were 30-45mins wait time. The weather was rainy when we went but it didn't negatively affect our time, we bought some cheap ponchos which solved the problem and didn't affect any of the rides. We started off in the Madagascar area and were all able to go on the river ride, both of our boys loved it, we ended up doing it a few times. Our 6yr old was able to go on all rides apart from the Battlestar Galactica rides, I took him on the Mummy ride and apart from his initial apprehension he ended up loving it (this ride is my favourite), he also loved the Jurassic Park Rapids ride and Tranformers Rides. Our 2yr old is quite little and wasn't able to go on many rides apart from the Madagascar river ride, Madagascar carousel and the Treasure Hunters Car ride, but there was enough happening to keep him visually entertained. Even with our express passes meaning we didn't have to wait for any lines we still managed to spend from opening to close at USS, that was without doing any of the movie style shows such as shreks 4-d adventure or the Donkey Live show. All in all it was a fantastic day and we ended up going back to Sentosa for a second day to do Adventure Cove and the luge etc.

review_333525631,“Simply awesome!! A must must to do in Singapore ”,"It's my first ever universal studios visit n I simply luved it.. All themes and rides are amazing. The best being transformers, followed by Jurassic park rapids the and the mummy ride.. . We went with my 2.5 years old daughter who jus managed to cross the minimum height requirements.. She also had a great time.. One piece of suggestion, if u are going with a child who can't do all rides , then go through the 'single rider' line instead of taking express pass( which is pricey).. Cos at most of the times there is a waiting even at the express line, but single rider lines is super duper fast.. The main 3 rides above I did with single rider and managed to complete it within max half n hour..

review_333516668,“Awesome time. ”,"Ok so like everyone else we thought reaching there in the morning at 10 am would safe us from all the hassle but guess what that's not true. There was a long line and the whole place was super crowded. But then we came to know that if you're visiting universal studios during Christmas time then go at 5 pm because the ticket price is half (48SD) and there's not more than 10 minutes waiting time for the rides. So we spent 10 am to 4 pm on the beaches and at 5 pm when we reached universal studios to our surprise there were not more than five people in the line and there was so less of the waiting time that we did some of the rides twice. So I would recommend go at 5 pm and enjoy less crowd and good weather.

review_333513848,“Spend an Exciting Half Day Here!”,"This steeply priced attraction basically contains 'rides' through movie sets. Scenes from famous movies (like ""The Mummy"", ""WaterWorld"" , etc.) are recreated and one can experience that set on a real size/ scale. Many of the sets have actors/ actresses doing stunts, and some of the sets involve the visitors too.I really liked the WaterWorld set.

review_333450447,“Lots of fun filled rides!!”,"On my last visit to Singapore i had been to Sentosa island.. but this was way more fun and totally worth.There are numerous rides and a day may not be enough to cover it all, so you have to come as early as possible and select the rides and then just go for it.The only problem is the huge queues at every ride, especially the good ones. But there are drinking water points along most queues and you can eat while waiting to reduce time waste. If you are looking for some serious fun! better to head straight to the Transformer section, which has a super cool ride, near that there will be the huge blue roller coaster rides. If you like to experience 4D movie, try the Shrek one.Also there is super fun and thrilling ride in the Egypt ..mummies section. MUST TRY!Also there was a water ride initially, it was fun,, but not worth waiting for an hour...So if queues are not bearable for you there is VIP pass sort of thing which is a more expensive ticket with shorter queues, but personally i feel it not that necessary.

review_333053965,“Well worth a visit but beware if they think it will rain!”,"We had a good time here. If I visited Singapore more often or had spent longer there it's well worth going for their annual passBefore going I had read reviews on the rides and watched online videos. Before hitting 40 I was terrified of roller coasters but then started to love them. At the time of visiting I was going through a phase of being scared of them again and so some of the reviews got me a trifle scared.One ride that others had said was scary was 'Revenge of the Mummy'. I entered this with trepidation. However I found that the reviews were wrong and there was nothing at all the be scared about. In fact we rode it several times in a row! It has a roller coaster part but this was tame. The ride is over and done with far too quickly.Because of my fear of roller coasters re emerging I left riding Battlestar Galactia far too late. Yes, it was scary but it was also very fun and given the chance I would ride it again and again. Based on online advice we did the Human ride first. I then plucked up enough courage to go on the Cylon side. We waited in line for around 30 minutes only to be told that the ride was closed. No raintickets were offered or an option to jump the line once it re opened which I felt was very poor practice. I am sure that had this been the USA or Disney some sort of compensation would have been offered. Upon stepping outside we found that it was not raining (there were thunder clouds in the sky) and there was no reason for the ride to shut.When Universal finally realised that the rain was not going to happen, the ride reopened. Fortunately we noticed this and got in the long line again (had we received 'credit' for our long wait previously then we should have gone to the front of the line or in the fast track lane). As the line was long and the park closed at 6pm we were worried that we would again be asked to leave the line and depart. Fortunately Universal allowed us to continue the wait and we did eventually get to ride. As we exited we found that although the park was officially closed and the rides were all closed, shops were still open and many many people were still inside the park. This was at least an hour after official closing. So don't rush to leave even if the official close time has passed!All the rides we went on were fun but the only real thrill ride was Battlestar Galatica. Food is expensive in the park as is merchandise. More in line with US prices than Asian prices. But then Singapore (bar China Town) is not typical of other Asian places and is an expensive place to visit on the whole.One thing that was missing, that is available in both the US Universal parks (which I have visited numerous times) is a backlot tour. This is mainly because it's just a theme park and not a working film studio.All in all a good day. There is a lot to do in Sentosa itself and I would love to have time one day to spend more time there to explore.Worth a visit and fun for all ages. But if roller coasters are your thing then don't be a chicken like I was and ride them early before the lines get busy.

For those rides with long ""Q"" you can purchase and Express ticket for that particular ride. Popular rides like Battlestar Galactica, Transformer etc, the waiting time can be more then an hour wait.Do skip Treasure Hunter unless you have young kids. The waiting time can sometimes be quite long and it is not worth waiting in the ""Q"". You may like to have your dinner at KT Grill in the evening. Look for Daniel the Manager there.

Divided by ""world"" from ""Hollywood"" and ""Far Far Away"" to ""The Lost World"" and ""Sci-fi City"". There is a place for everyone. Was there on 2 occasions and it was a blast. For guys who are looking for thrill of a ride, there are battle-star galactic rides, for guys who wanna look at shows, there are indoor shows at so many locations as well as street performers at all sort of timing which you can get the timing from the stands as you walk in, and for guys who are there to chill, there are eateries and drink stalls everywhere. Coming to the end of the year, there is a Christmas theme going on, was there during the Halloween period with spooky decorations and interesting performance. Point to know, hydrate hydrate hydrate, as its quite a bit of walking around and waiting inline for rides. USS Singapore opens from 10am to 6pm daily.

The transformer ride is a must go. Pretty much the best ride ever! The jurassic park water ride was the dumbest thing tho, but you will never know so we still lined up 60 minutes to try it. We heard the blue and red roller coasters are great and it was close for many years because it has some accident. We didnt have time to try it but it does look really nice. After all, it is not big, if you are walking with a normal pace you can probably finish walking without sightseeing in like 30 mins.

review_332686992,“A Memorable Family Experience”,"Went to USS with my husband and three sons (12, 7 and 5 years old). Most of the rides were for adults or taller kids but our children did enjoy those that were available for them. The long queues were worth it. Our favorite ride was the wet raft ride at the Jurassic World. The Transformers 3d ride was also exciting (even if we lined up for more than an hour!). If you love extreme rides, i highly recommend Battlestar Galactica! The food served was not as splendid but the kids loved their hotdogs, fries and nuggets. The turkey leg served was dry. Not much fab dining choices inside the park. It was our family bonding time so we tried not to mind the staff (facilitating the queues and operating the rides) who never smiled and were very stiff. This is the reason why I am only rating them 4 despite the impressive facilities.Bringing extra shirts (especially for kids) would help. An empty / handy refillable bottled water container would also be great since there are lots of cold and potable water / drinking fountains all over the amusement park. Mint candies came in handy for me and were very helpful after my extreme roller coaster ride! There are quick lines for 'one person' in some rides like The Mummy which you might want to take advantage of. Overall, it was a memorable and lovely bonding experience for us.

You have to try their churros there, it's freshly baked right from the oven! If you feel hungry or thirsty, there are many food stalls along the way so you won't have to walk much back to their restaurant! USS is very clean too!

review_332575248,“Good experience for movie lovers”,"First, purchase the ticket online to enjoy some privilege such as free meal voucher and avoid the queue at the ticketing counter. Second, the park would change its parade and activities based on the festival. I was disappointed because the parade has cancelled due to Christmas festival but the specially made events were not great enough to wow visitors. The firework only available during weekend. The facilities are good but some rides are incredibly short. If you are not quite a patient person, it's advisable to purchase Express ticket. Good point is that the line-up area is equipped with big fan to cool the visitors. Transformer is definitely the highlight of the park (you can see from the length of the queue). Tip to play without much waiting is to visit an hour before the park closes. If you are lucky enough, you could take the ride immediately without waiting. (Do buffer more time in case the day of your visit is peak season). Playing in the theme park in Tropical country is exhausting. If you need a lot of drinking water, you may consider to buy their water bottle from $10 up with $2 each refill.

But a friend told me that he bought tickets for S$60 in china town. You can go on all the rides as many times as you like with one ticket. There are 3 ways to enter the island. 1. Cable car @S$252. Train @ S$ 53. 20 minute walk free of charge.The gates open at 10.00am and close at 6.00pm. Sometimes there is a queue for the rides. The waiting time for each is displayed outside each ride.

The moment you enter and get yourself clicked on the back drop of much loved Universal Studio Globe. They keep your camera ready to click pictures of so many interesting / innovative things on your way to the Studios. If you have less time than buy a pass for all rides. All the simulations, games Some of the Highlights:-1) Cyclone Roller Coaster :- Best roller coaster. I was little scared initially but so not to be missed.2) Transformer Ride :- I took 3 rides. One of my fav. 3) water world theme show :- this is superb. There are some surprise tricks which makes it more interesting 4) Mummy revenge :- WOW! This is for the strong hearts. I would not recommend for young kids :) 5) Jurassic world :- so much fun, Get ready to for some splashes and Dino tricks on you.6) Street Dances :- you will not get bored while walking around the Studio because there are so many activities which could be a nice photo op moments.

review_331727635,“Things can be improved for the image of Singapore”,"This is my 4th time here. Buying online tickets is a must as when I reached the place at about 12pm, the ticket queue was pretty long. But as I was using some bank vouchers I could only get the tickets onsite. Snacks are not allowed in the park. As it was the Christmas period, the whole place was decked with very nice Xmas decorations. I think the rides are too short especially if you have to queue for about 40 mins to get your turn. The people manning the rides can also have more smiles as they look really grouchy and the way they give instructions is quite rude. Not very good impression of Singapore if you are a tourist here. Yes I have to highlight that the weather is hot but this is a ""fun"" attraction so people are here to have fun! Food is quite expensive here as to all theme parks everywhere. We had a break at the diner near the stage area. The Double double burger is just not edible. You can charge sky-high price but your food needs to be edible. It cost S$20 for a burger, small fries, a coke and a small Milo. Other than that, it is a fun place for kids less than 14 years old. Very few rides for younger kids.

review_331724606,“Small but Fun! Skip the VIP Tour”,"We took the VIP tour this past November. The park is smaller than other Universal Parks, but has a fun ""sequel"" feel, as all of the sections of the park feel like extensions of their parent parks (""Jurassic Park"" becomes ""The Lost World"", etc.). Highlight is definitely the Battlestar Galactica duelling rollercoasters, which is similar to Duelling Dragons in Florida, except one train (Cylon) is head-over-heels inverted coaster while the other (Human) is a standard coaster offering a fast & smooth ride. VIP Tour was nice, but not really worth the money for anyone well-versed in theme parks, so instead I would recommend just the Express Pass.

review_331715070,“The joys of Universal Express!”,"We are a family of four with a 7 yr old girl and a 4 yr old boy. We had a 2 day stop over in Singapore en route to Phuket and decided to do the Universal Studios day trip. It was an absolute thrill. We arrived at around 10 on a Monday and were in the park 20 mins later. It was quite busy as it was school holidays. Having 2 little kids and with only a limited amount of time, we bought the universal express multiple pass. This essentially doubles the entry price per person but it was so worth it. When you see a queue for a ride and breeze pass to the front, you'll be thinking you're glad you worked harder for the privilege! If you do the multiple - around S$70 in addition to the park entry of S$74 - you can skip the queue for the same ride multiple times. We rode the puss in boots giants journey about 10 times, the enchanted airways about 7 times and the battlestar gallactica about 4 times. Would never have been able to do that without the universal express pass. Lunch was a bit tough but we opted for some pizza at Louis's in New York. Yummy! Snacks are available throughout the park (popcorn, churro, turkey legs, ice cream ( Ben and Jerry's) and there is a chillis outside the park for dinner. Regarding the attractions - there are 7 worlds . Kids will love far far away (shrek), Madagascar, Jurassic park and sci-fi city.The mummy's revenge is a cool roller coaster in the dark . Don't bother with the treasure hunters ride in ancient Egypt . It was epically boring!Some tips -Shell out the extra for the universal express multiple pass.Ride the Cylon ride as opposed to the human ride. More exciting especially the mist part.Do the Jurassic park rapid rivers early in order to dry out during the day. Taxis are available in the basement of the park at the casino entrance to take you back to the hotels.

review_331580083,“A must visit in Sentosa”,"We went on a Thursday, it was not crowded as the weekends but there was a long queue for the Gattlestar Galactica and the Transformers ride. Better to take an express pass if you are visiting in a weekend otherwise you will have to wait in the long queues, or if possible try to go there in a week day. The rides are amazing, you can have some thrilling experience with Gattlestar Galactica, Transformers ride and the Revenge of the Mummy ride. Tip: you can't take your bags & stuff when you are going for some roller costars. They have lockers available near those places but they are free for about 1 hour. if it takes more that one hour you need to pay for the lockers to open them, so make sure you take some cash (notes) in your pockets if you are planning to put your wallets in the locker because for some rides it usually takes more that 1 hour due to the queue. There is a display near some rides which shows the waiting time. Also note that the lockers won't return you the balance so don't put big notes there, you can get them changed in nearby shops or from the locker supervisors.

review_331265852,“A whole new world.”,"USS is like the ultimate fantasy world for people of all ages. Rides- thrilling for adults and fun for children. My two favourites are Cylon(the blue one) and Mummy revenge. Oh and at Jurrasic world, it's probable that you'll get wet. So it's a good idea to take a raincoat or a thin plastic sheet- anything to cover up. But of cos it's ok if you dont mind getting wet. After all, travelling in singapore needs an umbrella 'cos.... u know... the infamous Singapore weather. Online ticketing is recommended as it eases up on ur budget. For the speedy rides, you'll need to use the lockers to put your things in. They're free for the first 45 minutes, the machine will charge you if it's over 45 minutes. So you'd better avoid weekends when you'll get stucked in those never-ending long queue. It's gonna be the whole day so take something to eat and water..You know how things are at a theme park- so pricey. I didnt even take photos with those cartoon mascots. I was just eager to go to the rides and yes partly because of the queue. So rides- first... photo - later.

My kids took advantage of the (fast pass whick you pay a little extra for that i dont mind) to go repeatedly the rides that they wanted to. For a theme park they have very good food outlets. Not as complete as the ones in the USA but certainly it didnt feel like its lacking. Easily to get there from the city and beside it is the big SG aquarium so it makes it worth your while cause its hitting two parks all at once. Only downside is its really hot in SG so its really hot in there. I love also that its connected to resorts world so theres plenty of shopping and very good food outlets.

Queues weren't that bad but we thought 20 minutes waiting each time would eat up our day and decided to buy Express tickets (which you can buy from designated shops inside). Best decision ever. Transformers was a great ride but my 4 year old didn't think so. She also missed out on the Jurassic Park ride as she was maybe a centimetre too short. Food choices inside are a bit lame (sorry!) but we went to the Malaysian Food Street place as soon as we finished and had satay to our heart's content.

review_330924570,“Very impressive but long queues”,"This was my second visit to Universal Studios. I am not a huge fan of theme parks, however, one of the kids was very keen on a return visit to ride the roller coasters.The park is located on Sentosa Island and is truly impressive, from the Universal Studios Globe at the park entrance to the incredible attention to detail in which the park's themed areas have been set up. Two stand outs for me are ""Ancient Egypt"", which is so grand & realistic that you can actually imagine being there during that period, and the imposing ship from the Madagascar movie. ""Far Far Away"" (Shrek), ""Hollywood"" & ""New York"" are also very impressive. As mentioned, the park is divided into different themed areas and caters for all age groups. There are two absolutely crazy outdoor roller coasters, one with a traditional carriage set up and the other where you are suspended beneath the track. There is also an indoor roller coaster in Ancient Egypt, which is in complete darkness.The grounds are immaculately maintained and the park is extremely well run & organised.We attended the live Water World show which was fantastic with special effects & stunts involving jet skis & boats - definitely worth attending if visiting the park.Unfortunately there are are long queues, with ""wait times"" of up to 180 minutes, for most rides. Wait times are clearly advertised at the entrance to each ride which is great as it provides advanced warning, although I do not believe they are very accurate - maybe a little underestimated? Excessive wait times are what I believe lets the park down. Firstly, who wants to queue for 180 minutes or more to get on a ride? In my opinion, this is an unrealistic expectation. The issue is further compounded when you are visiting with a family of children of different age groups, who have different interests and ride restrictions. For my family, the excessive wait times led to the situation where our family had to split up & go off in different directions - not what we wanted to do on a family holiday. The alternative was for the entire family to wait around for at least 180 minutes for one child to go on a ride - also not a desirable prospect.Universal Studios is definitely worth a visit, even if you are not a huge fan of theme parks & despite the excessive wait times.

review_330801055,“A Fun Day Out!”,"Just recently went to Universal Studios Singapore with my family. Rides are amazing and enjoyable and the food there was appetizing and delicious. The mascots and stuff were friendly and welcoming. USS also just released the Puss In Boots Ride and we queued estimated about half an hour for it. We spend our time at USS about 8 hours. Would definitely hope to come again with my family really soon.

review_330777259,“A must do on your Singapore trip ”,"Let me be honest and say this was the first theme park I have been to. And its very impressive. The size, reasonable enough to cover in one day. Food and drink inside the park will cost you extra. The rides not to miss are ""revenge of the mummy"" and ""transformers""... The category5 hurricane reconstruction , voiceover by Steven speilberg is worth a watch. Madagascar and Shrek 4D , jurassic age and character meets were a hit with d kids. This is a must see according to me.

The rides were popular but not for me. It was pleasing to see that there were free photo opportunities with different characters.

It has quite a bit of activities so I think it is a most of the day event.

review_330443809,“Universal Studios - Value for Money ?????”,"Recently we visited Universal Studio Singapore with family with great expectations in mind. Arrived early as well as a non peak day no holiday. As the studio really is a great place to enjoy with family, however if you are planning for the rides, please think twice. We wanted to try the Transformers ride, Roller coaster all had a waiting time of 2 hrs minimum if you want all to sit together. We stood in the Q for the transformer ride & literally for 1 hr it just moved slowly & gave up. So by 11.30 am we were already tired & stressed out waiting in long Q's - just waiting & moving around, this continued for all the rides. So at the end of the day ( they close all rides around 6 pm ) all that we could see was the studio, its worth watching - really beautiful. However my kid wanted to enjoy the rides, which were ???? The food etc inside comes at a price. However if you have an express pass ticket then you can jump the Q , but you pay extra for the express pass as well. So at the end of the day if you have bought a regular ticket - not sure its value for money ????

review_330438858,“Bit of a let down”,"Mixed feelings. Some great rides but not enough to really occupy adults for the full day.The two main rides (Battlestar Galactica) broke down regularly during the day and we never got to ride them. After paying for entry fee and express tickets we felt a bit ripped off that we couldn't experience to two most exciting rides. We complained to the office and got lied to essentially. Told the rides were working when they weren't.Glad we had the express tickets though as the queues looked huge, even for a Friday.The staff were young, unhelpful and totally disinterested. If we had of got to ride the two big rollercoasters a couple of times we would have felt better about the day.

We also enjoyed Mummy indoor roller coaster and Transformer 4D motion Ride. There are also ton o shows which happen twice or thrice during fixed time through the day.

review_329898845,“An exciting outing with family - choose a weekday”,"Universal Studios will require your entire day even though it is in the Sentosa Island. So do not think of clubbing this with other Sentosa attractions. Make sure you choose a weekday. If you have no option but the weekend, it would make sense to shell out an extra 50 SGD per head to avail the express entry on a crowded day as waiting times can tend to be in hours. Therefore avoid weekends. The park attractions are categorized into 7 zones. The best rides to begin with would be Transformers, Revenge of the Mummy, Shrek 4D, Jurassic Park rapid adventure, Battlestar Galactica. Make sure you plan them. The lights, camera, action show was disappointing. Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase is good for kids below 5. Water refills available at places. Food courts are spread across the park. Overall an exciting day spent. Carry some shades, might get hot on a sunny day.

review_329837939,“Tips for Universal Studio”,"Some useful tips for universal studio which might be enjoyable for you:1.Choose the weekdays not public holiday. If you choose weekend (Saturday & Sunday) long queue will be there which will be painful. Better you should buy a express entry ticket for weekend. 2.Take light raincoat, light snacks in one bag. Don’t fill your bag with unnecessary things as you have to walk the whole day.3. Wear comfortable attire i.e. shorts and t-shirt and comfortable keds4. Reach there as early as possible. It opens at 10 am. Ask for free shuttle service (Valid for Concorde Hotel, Mandarin Orchard, Grand Hyatt, Shngri-La, Orchard Hotel) from your hotel. Or from anywhere straight go to vivo city and take the entry ticket from there. If you are the user of Singapore Airlines then you will get the discount for ticket.5. Don't forget to take the map from vivo city or entrance of the USS.6. As there will be less queue in the morning, so don't waste your time and as much as you can use your time for ride only Don't eat, don't take picture etc. You will get the time after riding.7. In some rides you have to put your backpack in lockers which are available near the ride. Lockers are free for first 30 minutes.8. First, without wasting time, catch “the transformers ride” which is located at sci-fi city.9. After that directly go to Ancient Egypt for “revenge of the mummy” ride which is indoor roller coaster. Here you have to put your backpack in locker.10. Now head for The Lost World to enjoy “Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure ride”. In this ride, you might get wet. So wear your raincoat before entering. If you don’t have one, you can buy one from there. You will find the raincoat before entering or a vending machine will be there which will cost SGD 4.11. After that you can go for the “Battlestar Galactica”. This is a outdoor roller coaster which has two tracks, Cylon (blue track) and Human (red track). Cylon is more adventurous than Human. Here you have to put your backpack in locker. Remember to empty your pocket.So many street performance will be there for enjoying.12. Other attractions you should not miss are: Shrek 4-D, Madagascar: a crate adventure (For children under 12), Light Camera Action, “Water World” show.You can always plan your day according to your preferences and queue timings. You should ask the queue time before entering to attraction, so you can utilize your time more efficiently.13. Also pay attention to “Character Meet and Greet” timings. You don’t want to miss chance to click a snap with movie characters you like.14. You can buy universal express pass to skip regular queue. But I would not recommend it because you can easily complete all the attractions in one day with proper planning. But for weekend it might be helpful.15. After finishing the main attraction you can spare time for your photo session. In evening there is different atmosphere with decorative lights. Spare some time in evening also.16. I recommend enjoying attractions you like for second time rather than wasting your time in attractions which are not worth i.e. beach party go round, treasure hunters. You can also skip Monster Rock show.17. Also you can find a crane dance at 9 PM just 5-10 minutes away from USS you shouldn't miss it which is absolutely free for everyone.

review_329807501,“Go at weekdays”,"I thought it would need full day long for play all the games there, but i was wrong. I went there at Tuesday, and it's not as full as weekend. You can try all the games you want, with a little time to queue. No need to buy universal express when you go at weekdays.Don't forget to bring your umbrella/disposable raincoat if you go there at rainy season.Don't forget to take the schedule show to know what you want to see, and what time. I would recommend, Water World show to have a fun experience. That attraction was so cool! Try the ""soak zone"" if you don't mind to get wet.Also, you can find many food and drinks and also snacks there. And if you want to buy some souvenirs with ""Universal Studio"" labelled or one of the characters there, just go to the store (but that a little bit pricey).

Read the review by C W from Perth and wonder which Park they went to, because I'm a 6 foot 115kg Aussie and not once did I have trouble with the size of anything that only catered for Asians. Got the Universal express pass for use once on each ride and thought it was excellent, however I will warn that appearantely the price changes based on the popularity of it on any given day. We looked online before going and it advertised as $30 and when we got there we were charged $50, so I think that is a bit rude. We went on every ride though and without the pass I believe we would have only got about half of them in. Very fun day out.

review_329492369,“A good place to enjoy the whole day but try to come early on weekends”,"We travelled to Universal studios as a couple on board of a tour package to SG in November. While it was an optional item on the trip, we decided to go ourselves on what happened to be a Sunday. First up, you can get cheaper Universal studio tickets from travel agents than at the door so do try and see if thats possible. Secondly there are various packages online in which USS may be part of an attraction package combined with other Sentosa activities so you may want to see you can save their or not. Secondly if you're going on a weekend i'd advice reaching their early and going to the more popular rides perhaps - such as the Revenge of the mummy or the Transformers roller coaster as they tend to have higher waiting times during the day. One thing which is really cheap of these guys is something called Express pass which allows people to get into rides instantly instead of through the queues for a higher entry price. Having two sets of lines for entry is something medieval and having this in a beautiful modern city like SG is poor taste. Anyways in terms of the rides the Lost world ride, the Waterworld experience (which has specific timings only so keep that in mind), the transformer rides or the Jurassic Park one are good. Another crafty trick by them to make money is use of locker for rides at 4$ for 20 mins (after a small complimentary time) to keep your stuff so ensure you don't carry bags, purses etc. unless you really need them there, Apart from the rides we had fun with the photo ops and the small entertainment shows at every section of USS . All in all good fun and enough to occupy almost a full day till evening on a weekend due to the crowds.

Even though there are limited rides for children 3 yrs old and below, they would still be able to enjoy as they would be able to see their favourite characters.

review_329301539,“Adventure for kids”,"The place is primarily meant for kids with only 3-4 rides which are thrilling and make adult crave for more. The roller coasters at the Transformers area and one at Egypt area are a must. Waterworld is a must visit and the show put up is very impresssive, looks straight out of an action thriller.

review_329276735,“Thrill & fun filled day”,"Our sole purpose of going to Singapore was to spend a day at USS. It was raining on the day we arrived but thank goodness it was bright and sunning day the next day. We went on Wednesday to avoid the weekend crush and it was a good decision. The waiting period at most of the rides were between 5 - 15 mins. But by mid afternoon the waiting period of the popular rides were up to 45mins. My suggestions is to for the popular rides in the morning and purchase the Express pass if you want to go for anther rides later. For those who shy away from the adrenaline rush like me, there the indoor games and 5D shows to enjoy.One of the ride - The Jurassic Park you need to wear raincoat/poncho so its good to bring your own or your can buy them at SD4.00.However please be prepared to do a lot of walkings and hot sun so drink plenty of water. Please watch out for the Waterwork show - it was brilliant and not to be missed.Will definitely come again as our 2 teens really enjoyed the theme park.

review_329267249,“Great fun”,"Family of four visited universal studios park in Singapore over spring break. It is a great park with many of the same attractions as in the USA. Not cheap, but worth it for a full day of fun.

review_329224986,“Worth a day's activities”,"-:- I being a regular and frequent visitor to USS will mean I don't experience the kind of things you can experience situationally as a first-time visitor/guest to the park. Events such as a heavy downpour which leads to hours and hours of suspension of outdoor attractions, or technical faults with certain machines, etc. -:-I recall clearly that 4 years back my first visit to USS was fun and filled my entire day. I visited there alone and was very timid at that time, and went on most rides before wrapping up the day. I did not have major issues with the park, but I did note that the prices on almost everything (F&B, Retail, etc) were almost exorbitant. There were certain long queues at the hit attractions such BSG:HvsC, RoTM and CF.Generally to this day, the regular problems still stay, such as long queues, bad weather during certain months, etc. Queues are not something they can manage on their end, other than effective crowd control. There is only so many people at once they can admit to each attraction/ride/rollercoaster/location/etc at once, and you have to consider human delays such as when loading and unloading guests.I recommend getting a Universal Express Pass if you know you will be there for the whole day or when you won't have enough time to wait out all the queues if you're visiting other parks or other places on Sentosa. It's best to get a Universal Express Pass early in the day as the prices are cheaper (~S$50++). The more passes they sell, the more expensive they get. This is to reduce the number of express guests so that there will not be an equally long queue for express as with the regular queue.I am now an annual pass holder with unlimited Universal Express and I am practically ""immune"" to all the rides and attractions, so I really cannot comment much on how my experience is on the rides. I can only advise to visit all the attractions at least twice each, just in case there are faulty systems and you may have missed some parts without realising it.Cheers

review_329186701,“Awesome place ...”,"Have listen a lot about universal studios singapore and it's really true by all means. In fact each place & each ride gives u amazing feeling. The most liked and never missed rides are transformers, mummy and roller coaster.Don't miss the water world - it's really amazing to see live performance in front of your eyes. The Steven Spielberg show is also worth to watch.It's not so big like Florida and hence would get enough time to cover all rides in one day. Having said that if u are fond of rides & want to cover all rides with more than one time would recommend to go for express ticket.It's really worth it & will give u opportunity to go for most favourite rides back to back.All major rides are having free locker facilities & hence u can carry your personal belongings along with u inside, however food items are not permitted inside.Enjoy your day....

review_328941730,“Incredible rides and experiences for anyone.”,"To begin, let's get one thing clear: you will never be able to ride all of the rides in one day (unless maybe if you have a skip-line pass) so plan out on the map early which ones are your priority rides. The park is a MUST when you're in Sentosa! It's probably the best way to spend a full day with friends or family, as the attractions inside cater to everyone. I also like how we're allowed to bring our own water bottles and snacks inside the park (unlike many amusement parks), and this isn't a bad idea for anyone looking to save a bit of money while in Singapore.The rides we managed to do in 7 hours in the park were Battlestar Galactica (Human), Revenge of the Mummy, Jurassic Park Rapids, Transformers 4D, and Battlestar Galactica (Cylon). The wait times are worst before and right after lunch (at least one hour), and best about 1700H (averaging 30 minutes). I highly recommend the Mummy and the Cylon rides, for sheer adrenaline rush (and makes the SGD 74.00 entrance fee so worth it), and the Transformers 4D for sheer coolness. BONUS: As of writing, using a MasterCard credit card gets you SGD 10.00 off the entrance fee per ticket, so swipe away!NOTES: Bring lots of loose change for locker rentals (about SGD 2.00 - 4.00), and a light waterproof parka for the random drizzle.

review_328894885,“Save your money for something else that IS fun..”,"My Wife and I visited Universal studios in October of this year and were pretty disappointed. For starters, the place is pretty small with a lot less to do than other Universal Studios we have visited previously. I will admit that if you were taking kids it would be ok, but that being said there isnt a whole lot for them either. The main attractions are limited to three or four bigger rides, and the rest is based around the usual ""themed"" streets and restaurants designed to fleece you of your hard earned. The locker system with fingerprint locks designed for storing your items whilst riding is seriously flawed as well, meaning they just dont open again. The resultant wait for an attendant to assist coupled with the crowds and the heat was a great motivator to leave a lot earlier than anticipated. All in all we felt a bit ripped off and would have asked for a refund if we hadnt pre-booked online. The only shining light of this place is the hawkers market just outside the entrance- great food at reasonable prices and just managed to make the trip to Sentosa worthwhile!

review_328617199,“Endless excitement”,"Once you plan to visit USS, (Universal Studios Singapore) you have to : 1) start early. 11 am is their opening time2) wear comfortable shoes 3) bring water bottle. 4) bring an umbrella, sunnies, and wear sunblock. 5) camera, and extra batteries. The park is huge, you cant visit all the attractions in one whole day. The street shows has timings and you have to catch Shrek, Fiona, Madagascar animals, Betty boop, minions, and a whole lot more - along the way. The rides are amazing especially the transformers, i so love it! Dont miss the mummy ride! Lockers can be rented. But you can bring a body bag for some rides. The galactica is open again, and human or cyclone option is available. Both runs for less than a minite, but swear, its the longest one minute i ever had! Theater shows are there to catch too! There are restaurants inside and the price isnt so cheap. Numerous souvenir shops are around the corner so you wont miss buying an item for yourself or loved ones. One great tip. Instead of using the colorful MOnorail going to sentosa island (most people go to harbourfront and ride the train there - its 3$) , you can take the RWS bus outside vivo city. Upon alighting purple lane's harbourfront, go up to the mall and look for the shops - Coach, Armani, near the activity area. There's bread talk restaurant at the corner, go outside and walk to the bus stop. You can see RWS bus queue. This only cost 2$. Going back to Harbourfront in the evening, you can use the monorail - its free.

There are also a lot of shows and 3-D movies which can be enjoyed by all, and especially those who cant do rides. The must watch show is Water World which is live action-movie and is an amazing experience. The only negative about Universal Studios is that one can't visit it again and again as nothing much changes here and once you have done the rides, the surprise part is not there anymore.

During our visit, there is a lot of people here and need to wait for 2 hours in order to just ride Human roller coaster. If you have a budget, pleaseeee get your Express Passs so that you can skip the queue and experience all rides in this park. I love all of their performance as it is very enjoyable. Their staff is helpful when we ask them to take picture of us. There is a lot of restaurant in here but for Muslim I advise choosed it wisely as not all restaurant is Halal. (Oasis Spice Cafe in Ancient Egypt and Mel's Diner in New York City is a Halal Restaurant) Average price for meal is SGD 15 per person. Bring your own bottle so that you wouldn't waste your money buying drinks here because it is quite expensive in USS. For me, it is definitely worth visiting!!!! I'll come again for sure!

review_328499997,“A Must do while in Singapore!”,"From the beginning, it was awesome! You can make it through the entire park in one day; the longest wait in line was about 40 minutes (during the week). There was a meet & greet with some of the characters! I was able to get pictures with the Minions and even Beetlejuice, missed Shrek & Fiona. There was also a “New York” neighborhood area, where you could take pictures with wax look a-likes of celebrities, and watch a live performance of the Sesame Street characters. Even if you don’t have kids, you find yourself singing along to the tunes that we all grew up with.Best RidesTransformers, the Ride - was set up for long lines, however if you go during the week, it’s only about a 10 to 20 minute wait, if that. It’s actually a 4D ride, where you ride in a “transformer” with 3D glasses on, and some of the scenes you can literally feel the effects! This ride was so much fun I went back a second time! Jurassic Park rapids adventure – This started out like a lazy river; slow & uneventful, like the movie…until you encounter the dinosaurs! More fun for the kids, until you here an announcement that some of the “attractions” have gotten loose. As you see more dinosaurs, the water gets a little rougher, but fun. Each tube, which carries 8 people, goes inside “the lab”, and right before you are “attacked” by a T-rex, you escape with a splash ending!Tip: Anything you don’t want to get wet, lockers are provided.Water World- great live show, with lots of action & stunts! This adaptation of the movie was very entertaining. The stunt personnel did an awesome job of getting the audience to participate and cheer on the heroes. There were lots of explosions, flames, shootouts and good old fist fighting. The cool thing was that the bleachers were color-coded, for those that wanted to get wet and cool off, to those who wanted to avoid getting wet at all.Worst ridesTreasure Hunter - (Just for the little ones). This one is strictly for the little ones. It’s a very slow ride in a car that you can let one of the kids’ steer (it’s on a track). If you don’t have children under 10, don’t get in the line; the wait in line is longer than the ride itself.Revenge of the Mummy – The outside was very impressive and there were also actors in costume that you could take pictures with. The ride started out slow, with stops along the way to feed you the storyline. However, while I was excited to ride, my excitement was deflated due to this being an indoor coaster that was way too dark to enjoy. Throughout the park, there are numerous shops and restaurants to enjoy a variety of foods and souvenirs. While all parks of this sort are kind of expensive, Universal is totally worth it, and I will definitely go again!

review_328018423,“Excellent day but you MUST get the express pass !”,"I have been to Universal Studios in Singapore before but thought this time around it would be worth writing a review. Earlier this week we were passing through the garden city and thought that a mid week visit to the park was a must do ! The park seemed quite but for a mere S$ 50 ( approx £ 25 ) my wife and I went for the express pass and chose not to go for the S$ 30 option which only gives you an express pass one time each ride. We headed straight for the main ride ( in my opinion ) which is the cylon v human roller coaster. As we approached the ride we were surprised to see that there was a 50 minute wait time for those with oi express passes. This wait, for those unfortunates, surprised me as the park still looked quiet. It became clear though why the wait was so long as my wife and I went straight to the front ( with our must have passes. ) when I noticed that the ride which once had 4 seats per row has been reduced to 2. Anyway, the ride was fantastic and we immediately went around again. After this we tried out the mummy, transformers, Jurassic park and a few others before heading for a Starbucks which are now in a prime location on the Main Street. Anyway, we had a great day but once again you must go for the S$ 50 express pass ticket for unlimited passes for the rides, it will be worth it, believe me. In the first hour we must have saved ourselves about 8 hours wait time.

review_327870480,“Awesome place to visit”,"This is the place you should never miss if you are in Singapore.I visited this place twice and it is really nice.Dont miss the USS parade at the end of the day(available only on weekends/special days).My fav ride is transformers.Pros:Nice location,easily accessible by MRT(harbour front,vivo city)Very nice staff.The staff helped us by clicking pics of us whenever we asked help.So many options for food.Restrooms are available near all rides.Lockers are also available to keep bags.All rides are well maintained and of good quality.Cons:Very crowded on weekends,so reach there at the time of opening to cover all the rides.Some rides like transformers may have waiting time over one hour.On weekends because of crowds,you may not be able to click photos with all characters.Food is little bit expensive inside USS.Evenings the sentosa express will be very crowded.Better to walk back to vivo city.

review_327512491,“When the big kids (and kids alike) come out to play”,"Would recommend going on a weekday ( we went on normal school weekday). Although expect atleast an 1 - 1.5 hours for lining up on the popular rides ( transformers, jurassic park) it wasnt too bad as the waiting area was well ventilated anyway. USS was very easy to navigate ( toilets, drink stations, lockers etc), would also suggest trying to get there from opening, as it does take the whole day to go around and ride most of the attractions. Let down was not being able to take lots of photos with the characters as sometimes they will not stop for photos. To make the most of it with kids, make sure they are within the height restrictions ( majority is 110 cms and above) Overall, it was a good experience for kids and adults.

review_327507867,“Hot Day in USS!”,"Visited mid-Nov after haze is gone. Took a MTR train to VivoCity and later boarded the Sentosa Express to USS. I noticed many people had their meals at VivoCity's food court and F&B outlets before going to USS as the F&B in USS is expensive. The Sentosa Express is packed and you have to squeeze into a 2 compartment on a weekend. They should either increase the frequency or no. of compartments during peak days/hours. At USS, waited as short as 10 mins and as long as 60 mins for a ride. Only managed few rides and left at 4.30pm. Should plan at least 2 days for USS and go during non-peak period. On our way back to VivoCity, we have to endure the same long queue and cramped compartments inside Sentosa Express.

review_327315635,“Fun Place But UNFRIENDLY Staff”,"Brought a friend who had never been there and he was all excited about it. After all, it is a fun theme park. Went on a Monday. Needless to say, the queues were just too overwhelming for most rides. We had fun. Wanted to try the Cyclon again at 6pm and didn't see the waiting time. Approached a staff who was busy on her phone being told with not so friendly face and tone ''Close! Close!'' I asked what time would it re-open. ''Close! Park close!'' Approached a staff at a shop and told park closed at 6pm. Surprised. Year end. Loads of tourists. No notices or announcement except on our way out we saw the notice 10 am to 6 pm. On a Monday? Much earlier tried to take a picture with the Minion mascot being pushed away. Shouldn't the staff be trained to be more professional and friendly? It is a fun place. Really disappointed.

However, even though the rides were amazing and thrilling, the attitude of the staff is questionable, they were a bit unfriendly and slightly rude.However, there are pros and cons ,but we should not linger on the bad things about the service and look at the pros of this attraction:)I would recommend bringing a poncho or raincoat just in case it rains, for the water world performance and the water rapid ride, for you will get soaked!USS itself is a lively and beautiful attraction. Not only does it have attractive rides, a real live Hollywood experience, but also a breathtaking scenery of different varieties of places even if it's from the movies, such as New York , Hollywood, Jurrasic World and many more!Universal Studios Singapore is an experience of a lifetime and is definitely worth the money and the time, and it is no doubt one of the best places to spend time with your family!

review_327040307,“Fun!!!”,"Loved the rides here. We got there soon after opening and hit the rides immediately. Transformers was the first and excellent. We then did Battlestar Galactica. Both sides were very cool with Cylon being the better of the 2. As the day went on the lines got longer and to the point where it was 90 minutes for a rollercoaster ride. You can purchase an express pass to make line shorter. Not sure of the price but would recommend it. The Jurassic Park ride broke down after we had already waited 30 minutes to go on it and were near the start of the line. We waited another 10 minutes and they gave us a one off express pass for any ride. We went back and they didn't take our pass off us. Food was standard for a amusement park, expensive and unimpressive but that was expected. Great day out with the rest of Sentosa to explore afterwards.

Having said that we paid extra for the express pass so we didn't have to spend any time in queues and that made a huge difference! We had no choice but to go on the weekend which is why we paid for the express pass but we also went early (got there before it opened) and the crowds were significantly smaller at the beginning of the day. For us the express pass was worth every single cent - we did everything we wanted to do and had time at the end of the day to take photos and we got back to our hotel in plenty of time to have a relaxing swim and some downtime before dinner. Beware though food is ridiculously expensive! We took our own water and had a huge breakfast before we went so we only needed a small snack.

review_326833058,“A short day at Universal Studios Singapore!”,"It was very inconvenient to redeem the ""Vitar"" (from Trip Advisor) e-voucher for a printed ticket at Universal Studios Singapore (USS). When we approached the USS Ticket Sales Counter, we were informed we had to find a certain kiosk (in the underground parking area, which was as hot as Dante's Inferno). The kiosk did not open until 10am. By that time, there was already a long queue at the main entrance when we returned to enter the USS park. So that negated the early jump we had on the crowd. Like other comments posted at this website, we were very annoyed to find that the best ride attractions (The Lost World, Ancient Egypt, and Water World) did not open until 1100. This is obviously a money-saving scheme by USS whereby they only have to pay employees salaries for an eight-hour day (i.e., 11am--7pm) at the three most popular attractions. (The park closes at 6pm, so USS probably factors in an hour to clean up, maintain the rides, and secure the park after the tourists get kicked out at 6pm.) The first ""Water World"" show was not until 1:15pm, so we did not see it. We thought that by going to USS while kids were in school (i.e., the low or off season) with less crowds that we could enjoy everything in a timely manner. Not a chance. We did not eat any expensive junk food at USS. We left at lunchtime for good food outside the park. Btw, do not buy your souvenir t-shirts at USS. Ask any cab driver to take you to ""Lucky Plaza Mall"". There you can get your kids three ""I Love Singapore"" t-shirts for SGD $10.00, instead of one USS shirt for SGD $20.00. What a sham experience to have at a ""world-class"" park--never again! I have been to the Universal Studios Park in Orlando, Florida, USA, and there is no comparison!

review_326351674,“Great fun but express pass the only way to go if you want to have fun”,"My wife and I went to Universal studios on a Saturday it is an awesome theme park and the rides are top quality. One thing I must warn though is that if you go on a Saturday or on school holidays there is basically no point going unless you buy the ""Express Unlimited Pass"" it will cost you another $70 Singapore dollars on top of the $75 you already pay for the ticket but it is well worth it, it puts you in a whole other line for the rides which mean you will be waiting on a very short period of time to get onto a ride. The people without these passes will wait in line for an hour plus per ride, and the wait time will ruin your whole day. If you aren't prepared to pay the extra money DO NOT go on a weekend or during school holidays you will just have a long day of standing in long lines in the heat. Once my wife and I got our passes we had a great time and I honestly felt bad for some of the people trapped in the ridiculously long lines for the rides. They have an estimated wait time put up above the line but these are bogus as well they were saying 70 minutes for one of the popular rides but I know from using the express pass to bypass the line that those people were waiting far longer than that. Its a great place if you are prepared to pay extra to jump the queue but if your not then only go when you suspect it will be really quiet otherwise you are going to have a bad day.

review_326243046,“Day well spent”,"We came here from Johor Bahru (a 2-hour+ travel, w/ customs/immigration clearance), and went straight here. I was expecting a childish theme park, but i was wrong. We didn't notice the time passing due to excitement. Once we got a map, we tried to see / ride all the attractions.My favorites were Transformers the Ride (we rode twice!), and Monster Rock. We even had a chance to participate in a mini-skit with the the Mummy characters. Alot of Side street shows, and appearances of Mascots from their movies. Luckily, we were early and there were no queues yet so we had made most of the park.All in all, a day well spent. Recommended for all.

review_326224172,"“well maintained, long queues for rides (even on weekday)”","went early on a weekday (tuesday) in hopes of shorter queues, to no avail, however, the queues for the kiddy rides were (very) slightly faster (in the earlier part of the day), and a good balance between indoor/outdoor queues so it's not always too hotthe transformer ride queue was obscenely long but the smart design of the queue (all indoor, air conditioned), with twists and turns, and screens and fiddly panels/buttons (which kept my little one entertained - ""fake"" control panels to play with at every turn) so i was thankful for that, made the wait seemed much shorter than it actually was! ride might be a tad scary for littler ones thoughbring (disposable) ponchos (and wear flipflops) if you are going for the Lost World Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure - bring a plastic bag for your electronics (it's not THAT wet that you'd need the locker - though we did rent one, regretted spending the money). shoes WILL get soaked, you have been warned - may or may not get too wet (depending on where you sit and how it turns) but it's best to use a poncho (they charge $2 or was it $4 for 1 there)the Ancient Egypt - Treasure Hunters ride was really not worth the long time we queued for it, and in the heat too, over in 5mins, skip this unless it's really short or you have an express pass (splitting your family up into 2s and sharing with express pass holders might get you ahead of the queue)for food, the chinese restaurant at the hollywood area has the lowest prices (and reasonably sized and good tasting food)there are water coolers spread throughout the park, so you can just bring an empty bottle to refuel, it's also considerately provided within the ride queues so you can quench your thirst while you queue, thumbs up for that!

review_326129787,“Awesome!”,"There are so many excellent rides, movies, meet and greets in this theme park, that it's difficult to know where to start. The Cylon, an inverted roller coaster is definitely the high point (or low point, depending on where you are on it) of the park. The other roller coaster was closed, sadly and there was a long line for Cylon. The Transformers ride is another high point. The visual effects and the jarring you feel while in the vehicle are too good. The flying over roof tops, falling down a hundred storeyed building and getting sucked inside a Transformer are all excellently simulated. A must visit. Meet and greet the Minions was another good point. We had a fairly long waiting period for most rides, even though it was a Wednesday and at one point in the afternoon, with overcast skies and all outdoor rides suspended for safety reasons, we felt that the visit might end up being a dour one. Thankfully, the skies cleared up and we could enjoy Cylon. The theme park is huge and you will require an entire day plus something to see it all. We missed the rapids of Jurassic Park and also the monorail roller coaster there. A must visit if you are in Singapore, very much worth the high price of entry.

review_326005320,“Amazing rides”,"I visit the park during a rainy day in august with my spouse. Although its a bit troublesome accessing the park using public transport, and have to battle the long que and the rain which pouring down to gain entrance, our experience in the transformers rides (one of the iconic park attraction) gave us something trully amazing to remember.I would recommend that you planned ahead before visiting the park, and its best to stay away during Rainy day, weekends or public holidays. Since the park area is relatively small compared with other universal studio, it would get crowded easily during the time i mentioned above.Buying a special pass is truly a wise spending, otherwise you might get stuck queing for hours before you can enjoy the ride.

Managed to get onto all the major rides early as the locals started coming in around midday .The Water World show was spectacular and the transformer ride a must .One of the cool things is a few characters walk around the Studios like the Minions and Puss n Boots and a few others .The souvenir shop was pretty good and got some nice things to take home.Two disappointments were the quality of food for the price that was paid and secondly the Steven Spielberg sound stage does not do him justice .Overall a good day out

review_325827153,"“Queue takes too long, Express ticket is not worth it”","I like how the rides are very varied. I went with my little sister, she's 10 years old and she has autism condition. She very much enjoyed the rides that are made for little kids, not to mention I did too. However, upon entering the attraction gates I noticed that queue takes TOO long. It takes around an hour for the Battlestar Galactica (human) just for my sister to break down and started screaming not wanting to go on it. I was disappointed on my sister, not the rides. However, I went there again after 2 days by myself and purchased the express ticket to cut off the incredibly long queue. It was around thirty dollars more, but I could only cut the queues once for every rides. Don't get this guys. It's just not worth it. However, my overall satisfaction, including the foods available is okay. Would definitely visit again if I was with my friends just to make the queue time more enjoyable by talking to them.

review_325690356,“A great day out! Great fun - suitable for all ages”,"I was a real cynic about this and had avoided it for over a year, based on previous experiences at similar parks in other countries where queues were excruciatingly long, crowds were huge and rides were short or poorly managed. I stand corrected.We visited with a family of 4 adults and 3 kids aged 4 to 8 and had a fantastic day out. We turned up at midday on a Friday and were disappointed to leave just before 7 pm.Rides had limited queues, somewhat longer towards the end of the day but still less than 30-40mins for the worst. Many rides had less than 10mins to wait, and at the start of the day everywhere we went we walked straight on! Staff were highly professional, friendly and service oriented.The park is big, but manageable size. You can cover the distance in a day with small kids - but be aware that you probably won't get round all the rides in that time. Divided into theme zones based on the movies with food outlets and themed rides for multiple ages in each section. Browsing the web I had originally been concerned that our 4 year old would not have much to do and would find the rides scary, but she had a blast! Lots of rides cater for younger children - with accompanying adults. She particularly enjoyed the water ride in Jurassic Park (no one got soaked, despite all the warnings and others of rain gear for sale!) and the 'roller coaster' based on the beanstalk from Puss in Boots.In terms of shows we found the street acts enjoyable, and the kids loved Donkey's Stand Up. The water world show was spectacular, but less suitable for young kids - fighting, guns and very loud noises/explosions.It rained heavily for some of the time we were there, but because many of the rides have covered waiting area we didn't really notice too much.Food options reasonable in choice and price, a bit on the fast good side but some outlets did slightly healthier options. Will gladly do it again.

review_325602653,"“don't go - save your time, money & sanity”","I'll reproduce here the letter of complaint I sent to them.I visited Universal Studios yesterday (Nov 9th) with my daughter hoping for a good time.I expected the crowds as it was a long weekend & being charged a premium price for crappy food is also a given in theme parks.What I did not expect was inaccurate wait time information given out at EVERY SINGLE ride. When we entered the Cyclon ride, were told the waiting time was 60 minutes to board the ride. We ended up waiting 120 minutes (2 full hours!!) We were tired, hungry, thirsty & suffocated by the end & couldn't even enjoy the ride! To top it off, the 102 minute free locker time had of course expired a long time after that. There were ALOT of unhappy customers who had no money (purses are locked in the lockers,of course!) to open the lockers. There was only one locker crew who was overworked & had to face a lot of angry customers. He ended up calling his manager who took 15 minutes to arrive. It was only after a lot of arguing by a lot of angry customers that the manager relented & opened up all the lockers without extra charge.We experienced the same wrong information at the Transformers ride. I specifically asked the ushers at the entry if their ""50 minute"" waiting time was accurate. They said ""yes"" confidently with a huge smile. We ended up waiting 80 minutes in total.I'm not complaining about the long waiting time for rides. It is expected during a long weekend holiday period. However, it is imperative that you give out accurate information about waiting times so we can decide how to make full use of our time in your theme park.The other point is - you already make plenty of money from the made in China stuffed toys & T-shirts which are marked up to premium prices, not to mention the overpriced crappy food. Making money from extended locker time after advertising false waiting times just sucks. Your customers feel really cheated & I for one, will never go back to RW Sentosa again & will definitely tell my friends & family my horrible experience.

review_325378859,“It will be a fun filled day!”,"Universal Studios Singapore (USS) was opened in 2010. New rides have been added since then. If you have the luxury of time, it's best to visit USS during the weekdays to avoid the crowd and the queue. The waiting time displayed for each ride is a good indication on how long you need to stand in line. Recommended rides will be The Mummy, Rapid Tides (Jurassic Park) and of course, the Battlestar Galactica: Human vs. Cylon. The Battlestar Galactica is a pair of duelling roller coasters (so both rides are launched concurrently together) and lasting for 90 seconds. You can tell which is the Human and Cylon coaster by looking at the colored tracks: red for Human and blue for Cylon. It's a thrilling ride, and personally enjoyed the Cylon coaster ;)You can find food and drinks in USS, but do note that the prices will be high. It's best to set aside a full day for this attraction.

review_324720291,“Smaller scale but fun”,"Don't expect a full scale theme park a la Universal Studios LA. What you will get is a smaller version with something for everyone. There is a couple of decent thrill rides and a few gentle rides and shows for the younger ones. A good half day for the family. We bought tickets online which worked well. There are also heaps of other great attractions nearby to fill a day. Easiest way to get there is MRT and monorail.

review_324623131,“Full day of fun”,"Good family day. Try and visit during non holiday seasons that way you won't have to queue for rides. If it's holiday seasons buy an express ticket, they made a big difference the last time we visited during the holiday season. The food is great, the place is very clean and the staff are great and helpful especially if you have kids.

review_324620874,“Tips for Universal Studios Singapore”,"Universal Studios is Southeast Asia's first Universal Theme Park and it sure is popular with the tourists and locals alike. Here are some tips with regards to visiting the place!1) Avoid Singapore school Holidays. Many students have passes that enables them to go in unlimited times in 6 months! These passes come at very attractive prices so its going to be really crowded! Avoid especially the months of June to August, where many students are on holiday and even the countries around having their summer holidays! 2) Head straight for the main attractions first! If you are an adrenaline junkie, the best is to go for Transformers and Battlestar Galactica once the park opens! Jurassic Park Themed Area now opens at an official ceremony everyday at 11am, an hour after the park opens. So, do SciFi first and be at Jurassic at 11am. The Mummy has rather short queues all day round so you can leave that to the later parts!3) That bring be to my next point: BE EARLY! If you want to get the most out of a day in the park, be there half an hour early. The queue to the entrance forms early, so go early!4) Good rides to go for: Battlestar Galactica, Transformers, Puss in Boots, Jurassic River Rapids and The Mummy. The rest are okay. 5) Good and cheaper eating places include Mel's Diner and Jurassic Park Food Centre (cant remember the exact name). If you can wait, have lunch around 2 when the crowds are gone and do rides around that time. 6) Shows are the best time to hit the rides at Jurassic and Far Far Away. Okay that's about it! Have fun!

review_324593189,“Most Amazing Experience in Singapore”,"I started early and on a weekday. Still it was so popular and crowded that I had to await for most things. Well, I am not complaining. It was some promo and abou SGD 76 per person for one day visit. You can also opt for 2 day or combo pass.Late in morning till late afternoon was crowded and long queue but just before evening - no queue! So I enjoyed Mummy ride and transformer rides twice :)Then there are the sets and actors/models posing dressed as characters from Shrek, The Mummy, Waterworld.Transformer ride was 3D and you can only enjoy it. period. Waterworld was the full show! with blasts, gun-shots and water scooters, even a airplane !Far far away and Madagascar sets were there. Then we even managed to get amused by a 7D small film as well ;)Foods were expensive inside, so was locker; but if you could just manage to take something in to fill your stomach, you will survive. carry plenty of water on a sunny day as you will get plenty of sunOnly one advice - never miss a ride :)

review_324567927,“Fun!”,"I loved Universal Studios in Singapore! I went with my daughter. And since we were there end October, of course, we met Frankenstein first and it was awesome!This place is really a great place to be with family and have fun. I think we were able to do most of the major rides like Jurassic Park's water ride and Far Far Away, Transformers, The Revenge of the Mummy and of course, Battlestar Gallactica rides (Human and Cylon).I think I liked Revenge of the Mummy the most because the experience starts when you get to fall in line. The props and the atmosphere is fantastic, almost believable. Loved it!Overall, I recommend going to Universal Studios Singapore especially if your stay is short. This shouldn't be missed.

My kid wanted to ride the Battlestar Galactica: Human vs Cylon, but us the young at heart could not imagine how we will be able to survive the ride. He went alone, and lo! and behold, we was up there. He was so happy that he rode it again. We also tried the other rides, also heart-stopping, like the mummy ride, canopy ride, etc. At the end of the day we were famished, even after having a hearty and big lunch at the Discovery Food Court inside the Universal.

review_324372587,“great”,"1- Universal Studios, Singapore is a theme park located on the island of Sentosa within the premises of Resort World, Singapore. It is the second Universal Studio Theme park to open in Asia and first in Southeast Asia. It’s a jolly good place to spend an amazing day with your family and friends. The park consists of seven themed zones- Hollywood, New York, Sci-Fi City, Ancient Egypt, The Lost World, Far Far Away, and Madagascar. It’s a beautiful and extremely fun place to be. The mascots are really cute to click pictures with and the amazing settings just make one feel surreal. It’s the kind of place that people of all ages would love to be at. All in all, no one would get out of the park disappointed. The money would feel all worth it and there would be a longing to return to it again and again.

review_324352411,“dissapointing”,"I don't want to say that I am any sort of theme park expert but I have been to a few. Disneyland(LA), Disney World(Florida), Disneyland(Japan), Universal (LA), Seaward(San Diego), Seaward(Aust),Dreamworld(Aust) & I'm sure that their are others I've missed. Universal in Singapore is in no doubt the worst of the lot. Don't get me wrong, you can have an enjoyable day here, just don't expect too much. I arrived at opening 10am on a Wednesday, No queue to get in, probably under 200 people in total to get in. WOW, shouldn't be a crowd at all. Correct, I think I went on all the rides by midday, longest wait was 5 minutes. I was not complaining but that was it for the day. I spent the next 6 hours going back on more rides, checking out the shops, food outlets etc. The park is extremely small and the ride selection is very limited. I would guess and say the whole park is less than 20% of the size of Disneyland in either Tokyo or LA. Did I enjoy myself for the day, Yes. Would I go back again, probably not. It's something you need to probably do, but don't go on a day with crowds and don't expect too much.I cannot complain about staff, cleanliness, food or anything else. Everything was really good. It's as simple as there was not a lot to do.

review_324197237,“Family fun even in the queues!”,"You need a good one full day to enjoy this attraction. However you need to prioritise and choose wisely which ride/attraction is worth queueing for. Mummy returns is a must. There were a few rides that were out of order that day which were actually the popular ones, which was a shame but anyways there were a lot more to enjoy. Check the weather forecast and bring a parka in case it rains because there are often no shade outside the attractions. Enjoy a bit of turkey leg while taking a rest. Restaurants are a bit pricey but I can recommend the Chinese resto to be on the safe side, food is lovely and more reasonably priced compared to the rest.

review_324145436,“Halloween Heart Attack!”,"This Universal is much smaller than those overseas, but still offers the main attractions such as the Mummy ride, Jurassic Park etc. We visited on Halloween and it was pretty intense. Lots of people having a really great time, but I was pretty terrified. My hubby was laughing at me the whole time and whenever I hid behind him he would offer me up to the ghoulies! At one point the look of terror on my face was enough to make one of the character actors burst out laughing!Actors and their costumes are spot-on and a real tremendous amount of effort was put in by the events team, no doubt. I paid for the express tickets when I booked. It says to book them early as numbers are severely limited to keep express lane queues short. We visited on a night where all entry tickets were but TAKE NOTE the express passes were still being sold everywhere around the park that evening night for about $10 cheaper per ticket. Also, since so many express tickets were sold, even the express lanes for the rides had a 20-30 minute wait. When I visited Universal Florida the express ticket line was usually completely empty, so that was a bit disappointing. Normal queues that night were even longer though, we would never have gotten to see everything if we hadn't purchased express passes.All in all, we made it around all the attractions in one evening, as well as the haunted houses. It was pretty expensive for one evening's entertainment, but it gave us an experience we were still talking about months later. Would I go again? On a normal day, probably not, to be honest, but if they have another really cool themed Halloween event and I'm feeling brave enough I will be there with my express pass at the ready for sure.

review_323539258,“An all round awful experience”,"Visited USS for their much heralded Halloween event this year.Having visited theme parks all over the world, I can honestly say this was the worst experience I have ever encountered at one. The number of people admitted to the park was frankly irresponsible and there was not a fraction of the number of attractions available to cater to these hoards. We arrived to the park at approximately 7pm and remained until 1:30am. During that time we saw 4 attractions (2 terrible haunted houses, 1 ok haunted house and 1 half hour cartoon on a movie screen). The combined time spent in the attractions was less than 40 minutes and we spent the remaining 5 hours and 50 minutes standing in queues. 3 two minute walkthroughs and a 30 minute cartoon for $60 per person.Now I know queuing is part and parcel of a theme park experience, but standing in line for 2 hours and 40 minutes, with horrible, blinding red/blue strobe lights pointed at your face just to spend two minutes walking through a poorly decorated train filled with bored and unenthusiastic student actors is unreasonable. There were a couple of rollercoasters open. Earlier in the evening, we queued for a ride called ""The Mummy"". Having been in line for approximately 20 minutes, we were told the ride was now in fact closed and we needed to move on.Later in the evening, shortly after midnight, we noticed that the queues for the Battlestar Galactica roller coaster were shorter than the time indicated at the gate. We stood in line here for approximately 40 minutes, only for the intercom to come on again and announce they there were experiencing technical difficulties and there would be further delays. As we were about to leave, we overheard a member of staff telling a group (friends of his I presume) in front of us to hold still, that they were making the announcement to cut the crowd so they could finish on time. Considering the price paid for tickets which advertised an event open until 1am, we thought this was completely unacceptable. We stayed for another 30 minutes but as the queue wasn't moving, and after several more announcements, we left feeling extremely annoyed.It's hard to blame the staff (who must have had a tough night), but that this could happen, shows the same lack of management that resulted in many times more guests being allowed to pay into a park, than had facilities available to accommodate them.The whole thing smacked of a truly dishonest scheme designed to milk as much money as possible out of a huge number of people, with very little effort or thought given in return. First time in my life I have been genuinely angry to have paid admission to a theme park.

review_323394564,“Tips to maximize your time & enjoyment at Universal Studios. ...”,"Universal Studios is open from 10am to 6pm- so you only have 8 hours to try and experience every ride, every show & browse through every shop, stop for food/drinks, take photos along the way with various characters. On top of all these, add in many hours of long queue times for the various rides. Quite an impossible task ie to cover everything in one day, even if you come at 10am & leave at 6pm. 1. Not every ride, every show is suitable for everyone nor will all be enjoyed by everyone. Decide which rides or shows interest you most or your family/group & go only for those selected ones first. Prior advance research planning through Universal Studio (US) website will better help in making the right choices earlier rather than on site, thus saving time.2. Buy your tickets online so you have more time for your enjoyment rather than wasting time queuing for tickets. Avoid weekends or national holidays if possible, as it is definitely much more crowded.3. It is pretty hot & very humid all year round here. Wear cool clothings & comfortable shoes as you will be walking for many hours mostly in the open - under the hot sun!Put on a cap or hat & wear a sunglass- be amazed at how much your comfort level increases.4. Food & drinks are always very expensive in all theme parks all over the world. One tends to get hungry & thirsty often walking many hours under the hot sun.Take a heavy meal before coming, at Vivo City or Harbour Front Mall. Go to the supermart there & buy some mineral water, sandwiches or snacks for later breaks. You will be surprised at how much savings are made. There are water coolers at various points of the park, which one can refill drinking water. 5. Take the Monorail to Universal Studios. It is cheap, comfortable & convenient & stops directly at US. Cable car is expensive & buses not so convenient. Monorail station is located on 3rd level of Vivo City Mall.6. Besides rides, shows & shops- look out for 2 very good singing & dancing performances near Sesame Street. At different times of the day , The Cruisers ( 4 young guys) & Mel's Drive-in ( 3 young gals) sing & dances a medley of beautiful songs of the 80s-90s. For those who can still remember the show 'Happy Days/Fonzie'- well, they sing these 'era type' songs on a stage with a Jukebox behind.Mind, they are really very, very good- certainly a great joy watching them. In fact, we watchd 'The Cruisers' a second time on our way back the same street in late afternoon. 7. Finally, carry a small umbrella with you. Weather here can change very suddenly from hot sun to rains. And rains here can be very heavy. You don't want to be stuck in one of the shops for long time waiting for rains to stop instead of using your limited time to enjoy the place.

My favourites are Transformer the Ride, Revenge of the Mummy and the new attraction - Puss in Boots.For kids - Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase is my recommendation (NOT the musical performance), it's better than the Madagascar: A Crate Adventure which is of similar nature. However, there was one thing that disappointed me and my friend. On our day of visit, queues for the attractions were not long (around 5-20 mins wait time) except for the Battlestar Galactica. My friend an I queued for the HUMAN and the wait time shown on the screen is 45 mins. All riders must put their belongings in the locker, and the locker service is free for the first 65 mins. We thought there must be sufficient time and we wont be charged - however, it was not the case. When we are about to get on the ride after a 45 mins wait (around 5 ppl queuing in front of us), an announcement was broadcasted informing us that they experienced technical problem and there would be a short delay. We waited for 20 mins until the ride resumed normal, but 65 mins has already passed. The express pass queue got long during that period and they have priorities so we waited for another 6-7 rounds before we can get on the ride. The ride is just so-so, not exciting at all. When we finished the ride and went to our lockers, we were charged for S$6. It was completely a waste of time and money. We did not queue for CYLONS with the same wait time since we were afraid that we would be charged unreasonably again.

So we didn't get to go.I advise all of you to go when it first opens so you can go on every ride.I really enjoyed THE MUMMY ride - its a rollercoaster in the dark. We went 8+ times and went about 3 more times 40 mins before closing time because the lines disappeared... We also missed a few shows due to the lack of time we had so we were rushing through trying to finish each ""area"".For some rides, you can't go without a bag or phones, etc so they do have lockers. The one near THE MUMMY is free for the first 45 mins then 4SGD for the next hour or something like that.. GOOD DEAL THO! Just get the fast pass especially during peak periods. I wish I did! Especially if you're that kind of person who hates waiting in lines...You can finish the whole park in 1 day- just make sure you arrive when it first opens. Enjoy yourself if you go - IT WAS FANTASTIC!!!! I will come again when I visit Singapore in the near future!

review_322858830,“Cheated on the Express Pass and Bad Customer Service”,"The online ticketing system is confusing and not user friendly. We bought 7 express passes with the admission passes for the Halloween Horror Night in a single transaction and only found out they were valid for the day admission. The system did not prompt us that wrong express passes were bought and they were not clearly indicated in the system.The guest manager at the park was inexperienced and unprofessional. We were offered exorbitant top up price that looks like day light robbery. After much frustration and waste of time, he conceded to our offer of $10 each - which was a fair price to everyone as that's the price we would have paid if the right ticket was bought at the first price. The unpleasant experience affected our mood and we left the park early. This issue was feedback to USS and I was again dismay with their response! They acknowledged the problem but offered nothing in return. What is the point of given them feedback? Waste of time!

review_322843871,“Great Rides on your way”,"We got an annual pass instead of getting the one-day pass. If you're staying longer, it's a good decision to get an annual pass. It's always good to visit on a weekday than on weekends. Weekend's queue is like around 3 hours per attraction. You don't want to be trap there for a long time. Food is good but pricey. Make sure you ride Gallactica. ;)

review_322841726,“My second visit”,"Bought the Day pass & Halloween Horror Nights pass. In fact this is my 2nd time here. I like this place so much, enjoy taking photo of all the special man-made building, don't care if it's fake, the fact is it's nice and attractive. Many interesting attractions and rides. My favourite ride was Transformers 3D, Revenge of the Mummy & Jurassic Rapid Adventure. Do check out Steven Spielberg's Lights, Camera. Action! I didn't really have to queue during my first visit in Feb 2014, the queue were terrible during my 2nd visit, luckily we got ourselves express pass at night or else we'd have to queue for almost 100 mins for each haunted house. The haunted houses were quite scary if you're going in pairs. I can see the efforts made in building the haunted houses and scare zones. I feel it's worth despite paying SGD 110 per pax.

review_322663329,“Tips for visit to Universal Studios”,"1. Tickets for Universal Studios can be bought online or through a travel agent...if you buy them from travel agents in Little India, you can get a good deal at 60 SGD with a 5 SGD food coupon included.. The food coupon will really come handy as the meal comes nothing less than 11 to 12 SGD... The best place to eat is at the food court to the opposite of the Lost World2. Please reach by 9 to 9:15 am if you are going on weekends and stand in a queue at any of the entry gate instead of clicking photos and selfies in front of the Universal Studio Globe... There is usually a huge rush on Saturdays & Sundays and you will end up waiting for 45 to 50 mins at every ride.. You will get ample time for photo sessions at the end of the day as the studio closes by 5pm sharp3. If you are an adventure and thrill seeking person start walking towards the right where the majority of adrenaline pumping rides are located - Transformer, Gallactica, Revenge of the Mummy4. If you are there with the kids, it's better to walk towards the left and head for rides like Madagascar, Puss in the Boots, Donkey Live, Shrek Adventure, Jurassic Rapid Water Adventure, Canopy Flier, etc5. If you want to enjoy at least 80% of all the rides in one day (which is quite a task in itself), please don't get tempted for photo sessions... There are a lot of ""pretty"" distractions all over the place which would rob you of the opportunity to try most of the rides6. If you are going in a big group (min 5 and above) it's wiser to book the biggest locker for 20 SGD for the entire day just at the right side of the entrance... Please note that there are not many of these big lockers.. So you need to book it in the morning..

review_322600653,“Singapore's Disneyland”,"Universal Studios Singapore was amazing. The rides and attractions are plentiful, and so are the crowds. Remember to go early, right when the park opens as the queues will be significantly shorter. You'll start thanking your lucky stars around lunch time when everyone pours in. However if you'll only be able to make it after lunch or during peak periods, don't fret. The express tickets are worth it in this situation, though pricey. Queue for the rides if the queues are short, and when the crowd comes in, use your express ticket to jump all the way to the front. Something you should make a beeline for is the Battlestar Galactica Rides, especially the Cylon Ride. Whether you're scared of roller coasters or not, these rides are a MUST TRY. Once wasn't enough for me but the waiting time was at 180 minutes, so I did not queue again. The food and drinks in the park are expensive, so bring along some snacks and a bottle to fill up at the numerous water coolers dotted in the park if you're going to be there for a long time. (You will)All in all, enjoy yourself, it is amazing.

review_322593799,"“""Universal Studios Singapore: Halloween Horror Nights""”","It was nice to enter the theme park after dark, at the same time, I raise the question on security as no bags were checked upon entering and I still see young children at the theme park even though this event was meant for 13 years old & above. However, the overall experience was alright. It was very crowded but the crowd was very co-operative when it comes to queuing up for the rides, or even to the lockers. Do keep your belongings safe because it was truly very dark at certain areas. Therefore, be safe rather than be sorry.The washroom was very clean which I was very impressed. Didn't get to try the food but there were some cute blood bags (you can reuse the bags to insert drinks) were sold as part of the celebration of Halloween Horror Nights. The haunted houses were quite fun. It would have been scarier if people were to enter the premise in a small group of 6 - 8? It seemed like there was no system and everyone was guided to enter the haunted houses in a go, which reduced the fun factor. Nevertheless, a big congrats to the scare crew and team as they did a great job. Would recommend for people who have not been to Universal Studios' Halloween Horror Nights to give it a go while the event is still on. Remember to buy the Express Pass so you can cut the line, since it is so crowded!!! Have fun! :)

Be prepared for shows to be cancelled if the pollution is too high. The day we went it was 177 so the water world show was cancelled.

Otherwise you will ended up lining up to 100 min' per attraction. For the halloween event, there's some scare zone and haunted house. The effects are really nice. All the details for the halloween stuff are just so creative. You can buy ""halloween"" food and drinks. I love the set up for this event. Note that you will have to line up from 5. I was there from 4.30 eventhough the door for the halloween event just open from 7.30, but there's queue already. And you definitely dont wanna miss the opening, better view from the center.

review_322089482,“Universal Family Fun”,"A visit to universal studios with an 8 year old and a 10 year old - perfect ages (and heights) to enjoy all of the rides. Based on available online advice we booked tickets online directly with resorts world to save on queues on arrival. You can save some cash by using certain credit cards when you pay, but this feature didn't work so well when I tried. Also, you'll need access to a printer for your tickets. We didn't opt for the universal express pass as it added $30 to each, already expensive, ticket. However, when we arrived at the first ride, Jurassic Park Rapids, and spent 40 mins waiting on a not-so-busy weekday, we realised the value of the straight-to-the-front express pass. You can only use it once per ride but it will save you hours of waiting and enable you to experience everything (once) in one day - obviously, this assumes that everyone else doesn't fork out the extra cash and joins your express queue! The rapids were fun and wet, and the waterworld show (twice daily) was fun, wet and noisy (perhaps a bit violent for really young ones). Transformers ride was the most nauseating but loved by the children, especially as they got to meet Optimus and Bumblebee afterwards at a meet and greet. The battle star roller coaster provides the most exhilarating rides in the park and should be kept until last, otherwise the other rides seem quite tame. Suggest riding red track and then blue, as the (blue) cylon ride loops and corkscrews to really get the heart rate up. We saw the break dancers at the New York zone involve the audience and put on a good show. The whole day will cost a packet once you factor in the odd snack and pressure to buy the usual commercial tat on offer at the gift shop each big ride exits into. As a special treat, Universal Studios is hard to beat for family fun. Highly recommended 4.5 stars (would be maximum score if it wasn't so hard on the wallet!)

I do highly recommend spending an extra $70 each and getting the express passes, for example with the extra pass we went on the blue roller coaster and waited not more than 2 minutes to get on, whilst waiting that little while they made an announcement that the waiting time for the non-express line was 90 minutes (the ride lasts 19 seconds).

review_321770133,“One of the Must Visit Places in Singapore.”,"Universal Studios is one of the must visit places in Singapore. It is an enjoyable place to visit with your family. There are rides that young children would enjoy, and also rides that teens and older children would like.  You can go there by the MRT or a cab. But during rush hours, in the MRT, it would be a little crowded. A cab would cost more money than MRT but it's more convinient. There were many people there, during the day we visited. So, we decided to buy an express pass for $50 and it was worth it. The queue in the express pass wasn't that long anymore. We saved about 30 minutes for each ride. The queue for the express line was just about 10 minutes. So we had plenty of time to try all the rides. Some of the highlight rides that you should try are the Cyclon, and the Mummy rollercoaster. If you have no express pass, it would be about an 1 hour queue for both of them. But if you had express passes, it would take about 5-10 minutes depending on the time. There are also 3D rides and 4D movies. I went there with another 5 year old kid and she enjoyed the Shrek 4D movie. It was kind of funny and worth it to queue up. The 3D rides is the Transformer ride.

review_321579217,“All over a bit too soon but some highlights made the trip worthwhile.”,"We visited on a Friday in October (family of 4 - 2 adults / 2 teens)The park was open 10-6 (Halloween Horror Nights necessitating a slightly early daytime closure).We arrived about 9.30am tickets in hand (pre-booked through AsiaTravel) and the gates opened about 9.35am so worth getting in line early.The day was listed as a peak day so we avoided spending the $50 on express passes until we had seen what the queues were like.We did the rides in the following order:Transformers (5 min wait) - great rideBattlestar Galactica Cyclon (25 mins wait - some technical issue) - v smooth multiple looping coasterMummy (5 mins standby line) - fun dark coaster.Jurassic Rapids (30 mins standby) - got v wet!The lines then started to grow fast (by about 11.30am) so at that point we bought 2 express passes for the kids (both adults having had about enough excitement/motion sickness anyway).The kids then did the Jurassic flyers using their passes (avoiding a 45 min queue) + Puss in boots coaster (avoiding another 45 mins queue).We had then been planning to go to the Waterworld show at 1.30pm but the show was cancelled due to air pollution/haze...So we had some lunch (round 1.30pm)We all did Shrek 4D together - 15 mins standby waitThe kids did the other Shrek coaster using their passes (avoiding a 45 min queue) then we all did the Madagascar ride (5 mins standby) - by which point it was about 2.30pm and we had completed our first 'loop' of the park.The adults then retired to a pretty expensive bar in 'New York' for 45 mins while the kids used up their remaining Express Passes (BSG Human (avoiding a 90 mins queue), Cyclon again (avoiding a 50 min queue), Mummy (avoiding a 30 min queue), Jurassic (avoiding a 45 min queue).So all in all, by about 4pm we were done. Without the express passes we could have probably done everything (once) but would have spent another 2 hours (at least) in queues and the kids would have gone on less rides.On balance, I think the $50 each for the 2 Express passes was worth it for us but if you are more used to the heat and happy to wait in line to save a bit of money you could have covered everything between 10 and 6 (just).

review_321577998,“Good for family and friends”,"I went with my friends, who had a ""priority pass"" to access the special line when queuing. I obviously also got one of these tickets that are a bit more expensive..but hey it was worth it. We did not have to queue for too long and therefore had more time to enjoy the studios to the fullest.My favourite ride was the Transformers - never seen anything similar. It's all made with 3-D; super cool!The decoration in the Jurassic Park themed area was really nice, too. And all the little things around the Universal studios ware very nice.A must see.

review_321263951,"“Prepare well, you'll have a great time (Express!!!)”","1. We went on a Friday, it was still very busy. So after the first doubt, we ran back to get an Express lane ticket (tip: you can actually get them in most of the shops throughout the park). 2. You could bring an extra shirt, or a poncho, but in Singapore it is not really needed. Do make sure your shoes can get wet. Although flipflops are everyone's favorites, it might be handy to have something that stays on in a no-floor rollercoaster, but you can take them off too.3. If you have to leave your stuff in a safe (you'll get the first 30 or so min for free), don't forget to bring your wallet (or, tip: EZ Link card) so you can pay to get your stuff back.Our top 3 attractions, so, MUST do:1. Transformers ride - I went with two little girls, this was their fav too.2. Revenge of the mummy - make sure your kid is not easily scared.3. Jurassic Park Rapids - especially in Singapore climate, getting wet is always fun.So, surprisingly, no Battlestar Galactica Human (red) or Cylon (Blue), although those were definitely worth it.Top 3 disappointments. Really, don't bother:1. Accelerator - wow, some people actually went in with a 30min wait line. Boriiiing.2. Treasure Hunters - I cannot believe the long line for this. Mine are 9 and 12, this was still a total bore. 3. Canopy Ride. Barely making this list, meaning you could still do it if lines are short.If you do NOT buy an Express lane ticket, only the top 3 are worth the long wait.Some more, random tips and comments:* Puss in Boots was busier than it deserves. On top, they said it was a 20min wait but it was well over that, more like 40min. This was our first ride and we got out after 20 to buy the express tickets. Then we took it later and it was fine. My youngest was smart and suggested that maybe it was so busy because it is good for all ages. It's not a wild ride and beautifully built, but I still think the wait shouldn't be more than 20min. You may have more time to waist though :-)* With the Canopy ride, 2 out of 4 riders will go backwards. Personally, I did not like that. And you cannot make 'reservations' for front seat.* The RED (Human) was an ok rollercoaster. Much less 'scary' or 'thrilling' than you would expect though.* We didn't actually do the BLUE (Cylon). It does roll all the way over, but they said it was less pressing than the RED line and hence could even be a bit smoother (=less thrilling).* The Madagascar boat ride was ok story telling and the line moves fast, but could have been a little bit more exciting. Again, I would have been disappointed after a long wait of more than, say 20min.* I loved the Express tickets, but I'm not the only one. Occasionally, you'll still have to wait in the Express lane. The longest we had to wait was with the Canopy ride. There was also a wait when we tried earlier for the Puss in Boots, but when we finally went, they said it was 5min but we were the only ones arriving.* The best food is actually at the beginning. It's busy though! Very busy. I think next time I'll walk out of the park to check the restaurants at the entrance. After lunch, you can walk right back in.* Bring a water bottle if you don't want to pay SGD 6. You can find fountains along side the wait line paths of the attractions. You won't find them outside on the walking routes though.* Of course: book online!

The atmosphere is great and there are lots of shows and other rides (many for younger kids). Halloween Horror Nights at USS is also an event not to be missed.

review_321075640,“Disappointing”,"Full disclosure - I am not a huge fan of amusement parks and rarely go. However, I thought my pre-teen children would enjoy this place. I'm trying to think of positive things to say...it is clean and there are lots of toilets. If you do not buy a unlimited express ticket I can only describe the experience as nightmarish. Standing on a line for 90 minutes watching those who can afford the express tickets (which cost more than entry to the park itself) ""jump"" the queue is infuriating. So is being told a wait would be 30 minutes and it turning out to be 3x as long. And this was on a weekday that was not a public holiday in Singapore. My view is that there are many other more interesting things to do on Sentosa Island than stand around for hours to have a 3-minute roller coaster ride. However, judging from the other positive reviews I recognise this is a minority opinion!

If u visit on weekends, u will miss out many attractions because the waiting time will be in hours! We visited on a weekday, but we had to miss few good attractions as the waiting time was more and had to stand in long long queues. Universal Studios may consider limiting the number of visitors on a day. Entry fee is 75S$ (onspot). There are express tickets available at many attraction at an extra cost which will allow you to bypass the queue. There is a VIP pass too for some 200 S$ !!. Any how it is a costly affair ;). Place is worth a visit, really enjoyable. Do not miss Transformers, Mummy hunt, Water-world. Start early in the morning and avoid rainy days as a few attractions get cancelled due to rain.

review_320087559,“Halloween Horror Night 2015 - Horror at its best from the 3-hours Queue!”,"As the parent and host of a group of six 13 to 14 year-olds, I felt compelled to set aside time to express the disappointment and emotions of these teens.My girl rallied her friends to save up their weeks of pocket money so they could experience the much publicized Halloween Horror Night. They managed to get their regular tickets online with our help for Saturday, 17 October.The much anticipated day came and mentally prepared for queue, the group made their way and arrived at USS, half hour early. And boy, were they horrified!The horror was not so much the wonderful works put up by the team and performers, but from the long wait! The group of teens were looking forward to a night of fun, and a memorable experience of Halloween Horror Night at USS but what greeted them were bouts of negativities from the surrounding upset and aggressive visitors from long wait and dispute on queue jumping plus their own exhausting long wait of over 3 hours for every haunted house! The 6 teens spent nearly $500 on their tickets and the high-priced beverages just so they could join the endless queue!By 1.30 am, weak and exhausted the group have only visited 3 attractions. With no more energy and money left to pay for their way home, no prize for guessing who had to fetch them home in the wee-hours.The group of teens, having survived their ordeal is trying to comprehend what has seriously gone wrong with the management of USS. Was it not a destination that creates positive experience? Have chasing after money gotten into their heads? Do they just care only about money? “It is disgusting to see that they have planned for the long queue and had positioned these drinks kiosk right at where we queued!” Those were the questions and verbatim of your young customers, USS.3 hours of queue for each attraction, seriously, USS? Why would any management spent so much efforts to build an awesome set of props just to pissed customers off just because they have not purchased the express tickets? Guess it is time for the team to reflect if causing disappointment, agony and disgust is part of the objectives of HHN 2015.With that addressed, our teens would like to acknowledge that the performers were professional and totally committed to their role. If all else fails, the performers deserved mention.

Also, something like this has not been opened yet in India. If you go to Singapore, this is one place to go for sure. Transformers ride and Mummy ride were the best. Madagascar's ride was also fun, great for the kids. Water show was really a treat to watch. If you are going to Singapore for less number of days, I would suggest you take an express pass which will cost you 60 dollars extra, so that you can avoid the long lines.

review_319725298,"“Very good if you pay for a fast pass, average otherwise”","After reading a few reviews, we decided the Fast pass was worth the extra cash and it was. My strategy for the Fast Pass would be to decide what kind of ride person you are -how likely are you to want to redo the thrill type rides. If you arrive first thing in the morning and can get on the premium rides when the queues are short then don't waste your Fast pass then -use it when you want to have a second go on these. I was travelling with a teen girl who wasn't keen on the really high thrill rides so we just went once on everything except the three really high level thrill rides and for us, the Fast Pass was worth it for not having to queue for 45 minute to 85 minutes later in the day. However, we did use it on the Transformers ride early in the day when the queue was short and it was the one ride my teen would have redone (you can only use the pass once on each ride) and in hindsight we would have been better off just queuing for that ride early on and then saving the pass for later. We were disappointed that the haze meant the Waterworld show was closed for both sessions and the decisions were both made at the last minute so we hung around hoping the second show might go on when it was probably likely that it was never going to happen however, that's life. I found food prices to be reasonable for this type of venue.If you buy your ticket directly from the venue online then don't queue at the ticket office - just go straight to the gate as they scan straight from your online purchase. Even though we were there on a Monday, it was still pretty busy but we found that because of the cancellation of the show, we were pretty much done by 3pm.

review_319686027,"“If you have the time and money, a must do!”","Had a lot of fun on the rides, the only tip, always check if it's a public holiday or school holiday, lines can get up to over an 1hr long for the popular rides, if its the only time you can go, make sure you get express passes, they cost about the same price as the entry fee, but it's so worth it (10 -15 min wait max most times compared to 45-60 min wait), otherwise you wont get to go on to many rides and then you miss out on a lot of the other shoes etc. The best ride i was able to get on was the transformers ride. Best ride i have ever been on. If i could i would have kept going on the ride. If you have young kids, hire a stroller, they have stroller parking bays all of the place so that you dont miss out on rides. And most of the thrill rides have lockers near by so you can store your stuff for free for a short time. Plenty of places to eat and rest as well. Was not able to give 5 stars because was not able to experience the whole park due to the public holiday and the amount of people.

review_319508119,“A must visit”,"We visited universal studios back in October 2010 during my honeymoon as can remember it as if it happened a few hours ago. The experience was great, specially that we didn't have kids at that time we were able to make most of the rides except the ones that were not operating yet. I must say the mummy ride is one of the best rides I have been to till date, I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise so I'll leave it to that. The parades and walk through places in the universal studio is easy and quick at least during our time there. The park was in perfect condition and the staff were very attentive and were able to answer every query we had. A lot of nice spots to make memory photos specially when ur with family or couples! I'm looking forward to take my son as soon as he turns 7 or 8 so he can enjoy what we did. The only thing that could have been reviewed are the prices, food and souvenirs around were a bit pricey, however that's the case all around Singapore. So you make sure you have a heavy pocket going there. I heard of this other ride that we haven't experienced because it's new called the transformer. I would love to experience that as well.

review_319500523,"“If you really want to go, go weekdays.”","was aware that it is better to visit on a weekday, but we delayed our visit for days due to the haze situation. In the end we could delay no longer as we had plans for our other days, so ended up visiting on a still very hazy and busy Saturday. If you do end up visiting on a Weekend, you will most likely find it a bit of a waste of a day, queuing for in some cases over an hour for a ride of ninety seconds. Yes you can buy an express pass and bear the queue, but even those were backing up with 20-30 minute wait times. The rides we tried in the main were not all that exciting. The best one by far being The Mummy. We were lucky enough to get on that late in the day with a short queue. Brilliant ride. The river rapids was a close second, but the wait was excruciatingly long. Something that irked us was the blatant queue jumping. Not to be racist, but an Indian guy pushed way down the line until he found some fellow countrymen and attempted to ingratiate himself with them. They clearly were not his friends, but they did nothing, then he gestured towards the very back for his friends to come forward. We were not having that, and made sure he was aware of that. Rather than look an idiot and push to the back of the queue he stayed where he was until his friends caught up. In a country like Singapore you sort of expect the culture to be more rigid in the respect of manners and etiquette. It didn't seem so, and few people have the balls to stand up themselves when affronted by such behavior. Sad, but trivial really. The park is not particularly extensive. It is basically one circuit around a lagoon. On a quiet day I doubt you would struggle to see it all in less than 3 or 4 hours. I probably would not go back, but pleased I have had the opportunity to say I have been. If you are a die hard theme park fan, then by all means tick it off your list. Just don't do it on a weekend as it is oversubscribed for the rides and facilities to enjoy it properly during this time. Otherwise just because it is in Singapore it's not a excuse that you must see it.

review_319435544,“Great theme park for older kids”,"It was hazey when we went there. Crazy hot and humid, we waited 15mts for water show only to be told that it had been cancelled. Seriously, if it was unlikely to happen they should have just cancelled it instead of making hundreds of people wait. One of the staff was rude when we tried to take a short cut and went under the bollard. We didn't cut the line! We went at the back of the line, she was just being a PITA. Also, any reason why my 8 y.o son couldn't take his Tshirt off before going on a wet ride? It wasn't like he was only wearing undies, he had shorts on. I personally wouldn't take kids under 4 there because most rides are for at least 4 y.o (and over 110cm). With the heat, queue and it also means someone has to stay with the little one, It's not worth the money. Another budget tip: buy your tickets from local travel agents (ie those at Lucky plaza) as you could save quite bit of money.

One must manage his expectations especially with the crowd.. it can take over an hour just to ride the main attractions! but some are quite worth-it (i.e., Transformers).

review_318825006,“Can't miss it!!”,"If can't read the entire stuff, read my tips at the bottom.First thing first, I am an Indian and we don't have any such place (not of this level, quality whatever you may wanna call it). The moment we entered, I knew this is going to be fun filled place. We kinda had half day at this place so we decided to only go for the rides we don't have in India. We started with Transformer ride, 4D at its best, say no more, think no more. I actually felt how Shia LaBeouf or any character of the movie would feel, had it been a REAL thing. Worth everything!!Second came the rollercoster, boy oh boy!! I was scared but i had to do it because it would be once in a lifetime stuff. I have been screaming during entire ride. So much fun. Third, the mummy ride, this was again awesome experience.Next we went for a couple of kids ride as we were with another family Shrek show, dino ride, madagascar ride, all alright not too great for an adult but a kid will love it.My tip :- Plan early, as early as possible may be first one to enter the gates. So you don't have to wait for hours in the queue during weekends (or 30-45 min during weekdays). If you want the best and don't mind paying some extra bucks, then go for universal express tickets, they are bit expensive then normal ones but gives you express/direct access/privilege to enjoy the ride without waiting too much. This ticket has separate queue, you get priority over 100's of normal ticket holder waiting in the queue. Do spend in this one, as it will make you enjoy more rides.

We received food and retail vouchers to use on the day which was quite extravagant :)My cherubs simply LOVED this theme park! The rides catered for their ages perfectly (9-13 years). They were able to board the most terrfiying rides due to meeting the height requirements.The day was glorious, but became more humid and tiring in the later afternoon. As we arrived at opening, 10am, we could board the rides with little to no queuing. :)The rides offer photos of your experience. Average price is $35 SGD. There are numerous food courts offering international cuisine. Prices start from $8- $70- SGD.There are gift shops in every land of Universal Studios. My cherubs loved the gift shop in Far far away land and Sci Fi land.Sentosa is beautiful! Once departing the thrme park, you can eat, shop, play and more...... an unbelievable place.A taxi will cost approx. $12 SGD to city centre hotels.

review_318655894,“Great place to visit”,"We went there with 2 adults and 2 children (aged 4 & 10). The 4 year old was just too short to go on a lot of rides which was disappointing as the 10 year old was tall enough but too scared. We ended up after 1 ride getting a fast pass - there are 2 you can get - one for each ride once and the other for unlimited. We got it for all four of us for one ride each. That saved us hours. There was no checking of our bags so we could bring in what ever food and drink we liked. Doesnt have the same atmosphere as LA and is much smaller than LA but still very enjoyable. We could hire a pram which was good and you can even get a double pram or motorized scooter for a reasonable price. We caught public transport from our hotel to Sentosa board walk and walked across. It was only about a 20 minute walk and really scenic.

The place is so well maintained even though there are lots of people going there everyday. the layout and designed of the place is nice and easy to find. the rides are fantastic and you just wanna try them all. I will definitely go there again but with vip pass.

review_317735344,“Bringing the Kid Out Time and Again!”,"This was not our first visit to Universal Studios, Singapore but the said attraction still never fails to amaze us.We went there on September 2015, and thank God, the heaven's blessed us with another haze-free day. It seems that Singapore has been experiencing for the past three years these pollutants coming from Indonesia. Haze somehow will spoil the fun in most attractions.Anyway, we booked our tickets on-line thru Resorts World Sentosa website. It would save you from queuing and sometimes, there are discounts on-line. We got our tickets at S$64.00 compared to S$72.00 on-site. We considered taking the express pass, but decided against it. Thank heavens, because of the haze situation in Singapore, the park was not overcrowded with tourists. Our queue for each ride was less than 10min. We went to the Transformers first, then the Battlestar Galactica Roller Coaster, the Jurassic River Ride, had lunch, watched Waterworld, proceeded to Far Far Away, watched 3-D Shrek, rode Puss n Boots Canopy Flyer, went to Madagascar and had a blast. Don't forget to watch the show at the Lights, Camera, Action.If you are travelling with a smaller kid, he or she must meet the height requirement of 3.9 foot in some rides. We took a lot of pictures as memorabilia. The kids got crazy with the Press-A-Penny machines were you drop a few coins to make your own souvenir. There are also lockers, food stalls and restos. You can store your things at various lockers for a fee. At the Ancient Egypt, you can even store your things for free as long as you do not exceed the maximum time allotted for free storage. If you get wet, there are also dry docks for S$5.00 or you can buy a shirt to change into forming part of your souvenir. The restrooms are also well maintained by the way.We went there as early as 9:30 in the morning and got out at around 4:00 in the afternoon in order to catch the Wings of Time Show at Beachpoint, Sentosa.Universal Studios always brings out the kid in us, no matter how old we are.

review_317724965,“This has all happened before...it will all happen again in Universal Studios Singapore”,"There's something really thrilling about riding roller coasters. And while you're doing so, why not ride one themed with Battle Star Galactica. Maybe even two?One of Universal Studios Singapore's most interesting rides is just that: Two BSG themed roller coasters, one for ""Humans"" and one for ""Cylons"". If you don't know what these are, don't fret. You can still enjoy the rides anyway. These two rides offer two completely different ways of riding roller coasters, but I'd rather not spoil what they are. It's better you find out for yourself.Having come here on a September, we didn't have to take too long in lines. So if you're coming here on a non-peak season as well, don't bother with the Express ticket. The most you'll have to wait is maybe an hour for a ride.There are other interesting rides and attraction in USS as well, which you're sure to enjoy if you take the time to come here. Of course, it's all fun and games until someone cuts in line in front of you to join their group of friends (sadly, this happened to us, and it may just happen to you). Amusement parks like these really need to take that into consideration as well in their queues.If you're looking for a place to feel the thrill and enjoy, then Universal Studios Singapore is right for you. You might think it's like all other universal studios, but I guess the only thing I can really say to that is: This has all happened before...it will all happen again.

review_317694163,“Must Visit!”,"Always a great experience at Universal Studios Singapore. Must ride the Battlestar Galactica, both the Human and Cylon! Intense but exhilarating. Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure ride is enjoyable but be prepared to get drenched or just purchase a poncho at the vending machine. Mummy ride is worth a try. Would be better with more thrill rides. Enter before noon and grab the park map for navigation. Great for family and friends.

review_317647334,“The 'horrors' of Halloween Horror Nights”,"USS is currently holding their annual Halloween Horror Nights (HHN) event on Fri-Sun till end October. It takes place after hours, from 7pm onwards.If you visit the park during the daytime, you may feel a little shortchanged as the parade has been suspended during this month. The park also closes earlier, at 6pm. Some attractions are closed, and some of the the Halloween props are left out in the open or covered up with cloth or canvas. Yes, it does make for interesting photos but it may detract for your park experience.Halloween isn't really very common in this part of the world, so HHN by USS is a pretty big deal. However, the crowds are merciless and you'd best prepare yourselves for what you'll be up against if you visit HHN5.Firstly, you'll need a separate ticket for this event. This applies to both AP and SP holders as well. The tickets are almost the same price as the daytime ticket, but check their website for various promos and offers. There is an option to upgrade your daytime ticket to a HHN5 ticket (the 'Stay and Scream') which also comes bundled with some perks, like a choice spot to view the opening 'Scaremony' and one single-use Express ticket.Secondly, I would not recommend going without an Express Pass. USS has fiendishly priced EP based on demand, so the earlier you buy, the cheaper they are. On peak nights, they can go up to $90! Without the EP, you could be waiting in line for up to 3 hours for a 10 min walkthrough of the haunted houses, and considering how the park is only open for 6 hours max, well, you may not be able to complete everything. Even with EP, you may be faced with a wait, although the queue moves a lot faster than the regular line.Sundays are the best days to go, since most people have to be at school/work the next day. Currently, the EP is priced at only $50 for Sundays. Avoid Saturdays at all cost. Also, most secondary schools will close by end October, so it may get even more crowded towards the last few days.If you hate to queue, consider the RIP tour. It is really the only way to complete all the haunted houses and scare zones plus some rides in one night without mad game strategy + running, with some time left over for a second do-over if you'd like. RWS Invites members only pay $158 (usual price $198), quite a bargain considering a ticket + EP would set you back at least $100. As part of the RIP tour, you also get a lanyard, a glow stick, express-EXPRESS access (you are brought right to the front of the queue), a 'bloody' drink and an option for a pizza dinner buffet or a $15 meal voucher. PLUS a zombie surgeon as your tour guide. HHN5 has taken a markedly local flavour this year (SG50, lor) and while last year's event felt more polished and professional, this year's HHN5 is more appealing in terms of the scare-factor. 3 of the 4 haunted houses are very local and familiar, and these were the ghosts stories I grew up with, and thus really quite scary.More tips from me:- one of the SCARIEST things at the park is...the price of the drinks. So bring your own waterbottle, and fill up at the many water fountains around the park. They are situated outside the toilets as well as along the queues for the rides.- As an AP, I would recommend giving the rides a miss. I suppose if you bought a ticket + EP specially for this event, and are not likely to return anytime soon, you should definitely try out BSG. The queue for Human is almost always shorter than Cyclon, and equally thrilling.Taking BSG at night isn't really that special, but maybe it's because you can't keep your glasses on during the ride, so I couldn't see anything. - Try to walk a little slower inside the houses. It's natural to want to run through it because ""it's scary"" but bunching kinda ruins the experience. Also, you've just queued for XXX minutes, so take your time, enjoy the little details of the set and prepare to get scared.Many thanks goes out to the staff of USS, the scare-actors, the support staff for making this event possible!

review_317294688,“Park attendant should have more enthusiasm! rides are thrilling...”,"Went several times this year, some of the rides were thrilling (cylon and human). my legs went jelly after that, my teenager absolutely adored it, she went for many rides. I highly recommend buying the express pass, otherwise the wait could be 70 to 90 mins per ride, it becomes boring and tiring. the mummy and the transformer rides were fun too. some of the rides were quite lame though. If you are thinking of going for more than a day, get the season pass for $99/- valid for 6 months, annual pass available too!.There are many restaurants outside the park, you can get out(with a chop on your hand) for re-entry to the park.Please note there are rides that does not allow bags, sun glasses or even mobile phone with you. however, there are locker you can use. They are free up to certain time, depending on the Queue, clear signage to show you how to use. There are attendants nearby to assist too!.btw, if you want to ride on the Jurassic park, you will get wet, they sell disposable raincoat at the vending machines for $4/-, you can buy from watsons or guardian before entering USS for a fraction of the price. Please note that some rides may not operate when raining.Have Fun!

review_317216990,“Limited rides with young kids”,"Our last visit was in Sep 15 where Singapore got hit with the haze from Indonesia. It was not too bad as PSI was still less than 100. However, I would imagine it to be very unhealthy if we are there on days where PSI > 100. My daughter just made it for the rides with height restriction > 92cm so there are 3 additional rides that she can take this visit. However, at 2.5 years old, she found the Enchanted Airway and Spagetti Chase too frightening. We did not manage to take the Canopy Flyer as the waiting time was quite long and it was a long wait for a very short ride. We still ended up taking the Accelerator, Dino Soaring and Party-go-round, over and over again. These are the rides that she could take before she reached 92cm.

It was the best decision. We visited on a weekday, and with the Fast Pass, there was a zero (0) to 5-minute wait for the rides. Actually, there was no wait for most of the rides (Transformers, Cylon (VERY intense and thrilling- prepare to scream for this roller coaster!), Puss in Boots, Jurassic World)... Only the kiddy dinosaur ride required a wait of 5 minutes in the Fast Pass line-up. We also watched one of the Elmo shows and enjoyed walking around the park. We had 3 young children with us, so the Fast Pass really served us well. We were basically on our way home by 3:30pm (arrived around 10am). If we hadn't gotten the Fast Pass, we wouldn't have been able to experience so many of the rides. So yes, the Fast Pass is totally worth it!!!

Loved the Lost World water ride, albeit I got soaked, but it was fun.The shows were most entertaining, especially the Shrek, far, far away show. Food is expensive so we had a McDonald's breakfast before entering but had to buy something else late afternoon to get us through. Ride times varied from 10 mins to nearly an hour, but again it was all worth it. We really enjoyed it, had rides, watched shows, ate icecream ... and no kids. LOL.

I purchased the express pass unlimited $70 SGD was well worth it. Early on was getting straight on to rides and later in day was 10-15 min wait. Managed to go on rides more than once.The two rides worth going on are the newly opened battlestar galactic. Which is two different coaster types which race against each other Human Vs Alien. The alien side is 100% the best side. The other ride is the transformers ride. This would be the best ride I have ever been on.

review_316546602,“A must do for all the family”,"We loved Universal Studios, my kids are 4 and 9 and there are plenty of ride options for both age groups. I suggest you get there for when it opens as it gets busy, we had previously been told that the Transformers ride and the roller coasters have the biggest queues of sometimes up to 2 hours. We did them first before the line up's got too big.The longest we waited for any ride was 40 mins and we did the whole park in 1 day, in fact we walked around it twice. Late on in the day, we got on the Transformers ride again as there was surprisingly only a 5 min wait time. The characters that walk around are great, the dancing Bumblee Transformer was excellent as was the animatronics Jurassic World Raptor. There are plenty of toilets and places to eat, though they are the usual expensive theme park prices. My only negative was there was very little seating areas in the shade and the weather was so hot and humid. My little one had his 1st mini roller coaster experience and loved it, 5 times later, we managed to move to another area! My oldest loved the Jurassic World area and the water Rapids ride, a couple of drenchings later we were all soaked! It was a great day out for all the family, I would highly recommend.

The rides have very long queues, even the front of line passes. I will say if you have been to the Hollywood Universal then it is very similar, although not as good. And you can easily see the whole thing in a few hours. I also have to say that we wouldn't have minded doing the Halloween special area, but it was an extra $50 or something. That is way overpriced. Ticket price should cover this. We were in Disneyland for Xmas and there was no extra charge for all of the extras they had on.

review_316439865,“Amazing!”,"It was my first time visiting Singapore, and the purpose of coming here is to go to Universal Studio. I was super excited about going there. There were tons of ride! I recommend the Battlestar Galactica, the Battlestar Galactica is the roller coaster with blue and red track, the blue one is more challenging, and the red one is a normal simple ride but it’s also fun. I would also recommend the water show called Waterworld, it is very fun to watch and the actress is also very funny and friendly. Waterworld show could help you feel better from the hotness. Or Lost World is one of the place that people wanted to go in Universal Studio because everything looks fun and everybody love Jurassic Park! But you want to go there I recommend bringing your own raincoat because if you want to play the water ride, you have to pay a lot of money for just 1 raincoat. Now the staff, the staff is very friendly (for some), but the staff is usually nice, so don’t worry about it. One last thing, if you hate waiting in line get the express pass, it’s kinda expensive but it’s really worth it.

I am 48 and my 14 and 17 year old daughters talked me into quite a few rides. I went on the Puss & Boots Ride, Enchanted Airways Shrek Ride, went to Shrek in 4D which was great. You wear 3D glasses but the seats moved, sprayed water & air at you, it really felt like you were there. I also went on Revenge of the Mummy (loved it). Then my youngest talked me into going on the blue roller coaster ride (screamed all the way). Great ride but leave your shoes behind as legs hang loose and may lose the shoes. Then I went on the Transformers Ride. Awesome (another 3D/4D ride) but I had to close my eyes when it went too fast as I just had a flavoured juice.

review_316363544,“Being Young Again :)”,"I went to Sentosa Island last Monday and of course we never miss visiting USS. It's not that crowded when I arrived since it's a weekday and I was a bit early. I had the chance to explore the place by myself. I took a lot of pictures and even had the opportunity to have photos with the different characters like Sesame Street and Madagascar casts. The rides were quite heart-stopping. It was indeed an extremely exciting adventure. I'm always fascinated to see huge amusement parks filled with unlimited fun. It was a bit pricey but who cares since it coud be one of your best memories in your whole life. I really had a fantastic time in USS and I will surely go back there if given the second chance. :)

review_316261173,“It was OK.”,"The only gripe I have with it was the amount of time you had to wait in line for some of the rides, around 50 minutes was to long to line up in the heat. When we did finally get to go on two rides (as the waiting time was less than 10 minutes) were great. More signage around the park would be great as we tended to walk around in circles. Very expensive but very clean.

The queue's each only takes 5-15minutes. And after that we went for the transformer and mummys, yes it takes more than 45minutes in line, not worth the wait. but the most disappointed ride perhaps the treasure hunter, we are in q for 1 hour for 4 minutes ride of almost nothing.For lunch we have the Goldilocks which is a halal restaurant. Good food with fair price.The haze however affect our visit, we didn't get to see the famous waterworld show..sigh.overall, it was an enjoyable visit.

Most queues were under 20 minutes but the heat and humidity are big factors. We purchased unlimited express passes and did not regret it. Very pleased that there were many rides available to my daughter (7 y o 118cm tall) I think there were only 3 rides that she was not tall enough to go on.

review_316157331,“A Fun-Filled Place For Children Of All Ages!”,"A great experience for the family if you're ever in Singapore. The park is huge so prepare a nice walking shoes cause you'll do a lot of walking from one ride to another. Located at Sentosa Island which you can get to via a cable car from Harbour Front Tower II or via a monorail located at Vivo City. On a busy day be prepared to queue from 60 to 90 minutes so I suggest buy the Universal Express ticket which acts like a VIP card so you don't have to queue anymore and save time in the process. There's a ride where you can get wet, the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, so a change of clothes will be handy, although there's a vending machine that sells a poncho but your shoes can still get wet. There are also souvenir shops at almost every exit of each of the rides.

review_315948972,“Something completely different”,"I'd heard so much about UNIVERSAL STUDIOS at Sentosa, S/pore. Possibly too much because when I got there it seemed to be too much like a poor mans Disneyland.Yes it was good, yes it was easy to navigate and yes there was heaps to see BUT very little of it related to the STUDIOS part of Universal. It seemed to concentrate more on the movies the Studio had released with shops, shops and more shops trying to compete with one another for your disposable $. All relating to a token Movie. There were some interesting rides but not a great deal unless you are into the big-dipper type. Some characters at intermittent times came out to be viewed from a distance, ie Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin and a couple of others. Then some cartoon type characters viz Minions etc and probably the best of all would have to have been the 2 Transformers interacting with the Public - they were superb. Of all the exhibition type thingys the best in my opinion was the young lady dressed as ""Cleopatra""(?). She was a scene/show stealer. Her expression was flawless and faultless. In my opinion she was an asset to the Studios.This experience is not cheap so bring your wallet, you're gonna need it!! However a very big plus is that they do give Seniors Discounts to ALL Seniors with proof of age.

review_315936774,“Good Day out for big kids”,"Good day out but a bit expensive. My wife and I had fun riding the Mummy 4 times in a row. The park is very well done considering the lack of space. But 4 stars for 2 reasons; (1) the Battlestar Galactica roller coaster wasn't working. This is the 2nd time that this has happened when I've been there. And from what others tell me, it's a regular occurrence. (2) The Jurassic Park ride was very enjoyable except that lots of us got drenched and there are no facilities to dry your clothes. Universal Studios need to put in place a drying room for people to dry off. Perhaps provide a coverall paper suit to wear while your clothes are in the dryer. One young local man had his iphone ruined. I had to go back to the hotel to change. But that aside I highly recommend a visit.

review_315862513,“Halloween! Interesting but lacking Scare Factor”,"We purchase the tickets using with a discounted value of SGD 50 without the express pass for the Halloween Horror Night Event .We knew we were going to be in for the long night without the express pass and having to queue for hours for a single attraction.And it showed.Gates Open at 7pm and we were all hurdled into the entrance, where loud music and strobe lights of different colors were flashing about. There were some acrobatic acts at the start with an introduction to the Halloween Event which was Blood Moon. Then the whole crowd started rushing forward. Halloween Horror Houses showcase a unique event which was Singapore and the Asian Horror Stories like the Ghost Train which features a realistic recreation of the Singapore subway. Others like the Housing Blocks in Singapore are also on display, where possessed residents are out to scare you. And also Hell House is which you enter the netherworld where Chinese ghosts are waiting for you. Lastly tunnel people in which you descend to the depths of the USS and meet with the demons who live there.This is sort of different from the past Halloween Horror Nights. Because what you are experiencing is Singapore's Ghost events and Culture. Though the ""mazes"" are interesting with a good amount of realistic props, creatures, background story it lacks the scare factor of Halloween Fright Nights. To be honest, if you are looking to get scared, frighten, terrified, don't bother with this. But if you are willing to get immersed with the local culture, see something different. Then it's a good deal.Be Prepared to queue for 1- 2 hours for the houses if you do not have express pass in hot and humid conditions. Though there are stores along the lines which sells overpriced drinks. However the good thing about Halloween Horror Night is that if you go during this event, it is much cheaper than the Original USS Price, and you get to ride most of the Major Rides like Battlestar Galatica, Transformers, Puss In Boots and many more. Furthermore, you still get to experience the Universal Halloween Event!It's a 2 for the price of 1! Get the express pass so you don't have to wait. You might complete everything in just 5 hours!

I can't stress enough the value of the Universal Express ticket. For an extra S$30, you can avoid the extensive queues for your favourite rides, and in many instances head straight to the front. With a Universal Express ticket, you will easily get through the resort in a day, without, you'll have to skip quite a lot.

review_315652308,“Thoroughly entertaining time!!!”,"First up a disclaimer - I have not been to any other Universal Studios so pls don't consider this review as a benchmark for evaluating the Singapore studios to the ones situated in other parts of the globe.We were three families - 6 adults, kid about 7 years and two infants (2 and a half years both of them). We took two cabs from our hotel to Universal studios directly.The studios are open from 10 am to 7 pm. So in order to make the most of the visit, we reached there by 10.15 am. We had booked tickets online and that helped us beat the queues. Would recommend getting tickets online. We had purchased the sentosa 2 day fun package which gave access to 20 rides in Sentosa on a day and one day in Universal (more details available in Sentosa Island site).You can access all the rides in the studios with the entry ticket and have to say we had a ball of a time. The studios are organized in separate themes. All the information is available in a map of the studios at the entrance. The map details the location and the kind of activity at each place.The ride I enjoyed the most was the roller coaster in the Sci fi themed section. There are two big roller coasters in this section, Human(red) and Cyclon (blue). I rode the red line and it was awesome. The waiting time was one hour at each and I went only on the red one. Hindsight, should've gone on the blue one too (sniff, sniff...). If you are the adventurous kind should go for at least one of these as none of the other rides come close to this.We also enjoyed all the other rides, especially the transformed themed ride. Will not add more details and spoil the fun. A fun filled place for both adults and kids. Go ahead and experience the fun friends!!!!Note for Indian food seekers - my friend said the Oasis in the Egyptian theme section serves Indian food both veg and non-veg. Although I had a nice beer and a hotdog sandwich next to the Oasis (hehehe)

Found staff to be unknowledgable (girl selling tickets for cable car couldn't tell me much about pricing if paying on the island). Most staff were quite miserable too. For the rip off entry fee of $74 each they could at least pretend to be happy.Enjoyed transformer ride but it was short and Lost world ride was broken (I believe this happens frequently)My friend thought there weren't many choices for rides and shows and a lot of them were really old themes (Waterworld, Jurassic Park, Shrek are all really very '5 minutes ago') Singapore's park comes a very shabby second to those in the US where things run smoothly, staff at least pretend to enjoy their jobs and queues are organised.Food and drinks are very expensive - you pay way over the regular price on Sentosa that you pay on Singapore Island.Quality of food was awful - my friend's son thought he was getting nachos but instead he got a bag of chips with some unidentifiable bright orange sauce that was supposed to be cheese.I don't eat meat, dairy or eggs so there was literally nothing there suitable except overpriced, yuk looking fruit. It's best to bring your own food and keep it in one of the overpriced lockers. It would still be cheaper than buying food and probably safer.I can safely say I will never visit this awful place again. I'll wait til I next visit the States where customer service (abysmally bad in Singapore in general), organisation and choice of experiences is vastly superior.

We prepurchased tickets at the airport - this saves about 5 dollars per ticket, and went in to the first ride and waited in line. That took over an hour!!! So we decided to buy an additional skip the line ticket - this cost another 30 each.

We brought our own water, a large packet of chips and some frozen fruit boxes to cut down the cost while we were there. If u show the Sentosa Harbour Front Precinct Guide and Map (from info centre on Orchard Rd) when purchasing the tickets u get 10% off of the adult entry price. We were there 10am to 6pm and left tired and satisfied. Best rides - transformer, the blue roller coaster, the mummy, shriek 4D. If u are prepared to go as single riders which we did, it can. Cut down wait time considerably on the rides that offer it. The wait time indicated at the beginning of the rides on the boards are not always accurate. Our longest wait was about an hour for Transformer early in the day. The kids went on it as single riders after 4 and had no wait time. The monorail from beachfront station is free. Toilets are everywhere and clean. My family really enjoyed the day out and the park was the perfect size for a days outings if u go on the rides. Plenty more to do if your kids are less adventurous!

We were so glad we did! You can either get a fast pass for one ride on each ride or fast pass to ride them all day as much as you want ! Our favourite rides were battlestar galactica( I cried after but only for like 3 mins lol )Transformers, and the mummy. Don't do shrek theatre, it takes forever and it's not worth it! The whole place is just so magical and fun!! And you have to try the. Pizza place in NY NY. It's like REAL NY PIZZA!!!

review_315230354,“Fantastic family day out! ”,"Fantastic family day out at Universal Studios. Bought tickets online at home and printed them out for easy entry. Also invested in Universal Express Unlimited passes - allows you to bypass the crowds on a special queue (no limit on the number of times you can use it) - highly recommended to cram in as many rides as you can on a day visit. Purchase in advance is recommend as the may sell out for that day.Tried all the rides. Everyone enjoyed Sesame St Space Spaghetti Space Chase which was very cute. Family favourite for all was Transformers 3D Battle and Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (you will get a bit wet on that one though). Thrill seekers love Battlestar Galactica (Human/Red and Cylon/Blue) and The Mummy. For those who don't like roller coasters, the Lost World Canopy Flyer and Puss in Boots Roller Coaster were a good compromise to do with the family so they don't hassle you to go on the full on roller coaster. Lunch at Mel's Dinette was clean, efficient and reasonably priced. After 7 hours at Universal it was money well spent for some very happy (and exhausted) family members.

review_315118729,“Awesome!!!”,"Definitely worth the money. I had an excellent time. I booked a transfer to USS off viator, made for an easy transition. However, it is easily accessible via the train. The train terminates at the mall, and from there you take the Sentosa Express. Park is the first stop on the Sentosa Express.I got a $5 off a meal with my ticket. I ate at Oasis in Ancient Egypt. Delicious food, would love to eat there again. Rides are amazing, I went on Jurrassic Park and Revenge of the Mummy multiple times. Both rides have a solo riders line which is convenient if you are alone. Would love to go there again.

review_315081399,"“Great theme park, cost adds up though”","It's worth paying the extra $30 or $50 on top of the entry price of $74 for the express queue option. You can buy this inside the park if you want to see what the queues are like first. We went off peak (after the Singapore school holidays finished) - sept 29. In the morning 10-11.30 the queues were only up to 20mins, but 11.30 - 3.30 they peaked to 60-70mins - that's when we bought the express ticket. It made a huge difference to our waiting times 0-10mins. After that the queues were again back down, to 5-15 mins. As to be expected food is not cheap and items from the souvenir shops really add up. All in all though it was definitely worth the visit. My family really enjoyed themselves.

It's too crowded and hot, great experience though. Also the first time I dare to ride something extreme like the Puss in Boots attraction and then there's another one called Transformer. woah, never thought a scaredy cat like me will ride all of those things, but of course I will surely never ride the most extreme ones (you know which one).

review_315000047,“Exciting - Get your adrenaline rushing.”,"It is a Wow full day experience. We had a lot of fun in the park and we tried to cover each and every activity or ride that was available. There are ample food joints where you can pick up water, soda, wafers and other tit bits to eat so do not load yourself unnecessarily. There is a food court also.It is important that you take an express pass if you can. The waiting time at rides and other attractions, specially the popular roller coasters was upto 2 hours when we visited. Thankfully we had express passes and we could just zoom through the waiting queues. Every ride/attraction is more thrilling/beautiful than the other and you must try to see as much as you can. It was my first visit to any Universal Studio. Every ride is based on a theme and characters from movies and one thing that I really liked was that from every ride you will exit through a grand shop where you can pick up gifts and souvenirs following the same theme or characters on which the ride was based. However, I must also mention that the stuff they were selling was very highly priced and we did not buy much.

The queues were at times 2.5 hrs long, and the express queue wasn't much better. I was told later that it was holidays in the area and this would explain the large numbers of people. But having said this, it is still disappointing to spend a fair amount of money and not be able to get value for money. The water world show was great, but had a production problem half way through and was stopped for about ten minutes, and then most people stood up and left, as they didn't want to miss out on trying to get on a ride. Such a shame that people had to do this in order to get a ride.

review_314611585,“Long lines”,"Long waiting times for rides made the experience disappointing. One ride took 90 minutes to board a 60 second trip. Whilst express tickets are available for purchase an additional cost to entry of $50 - $74 after a $78 entry fee was not warranted. However, if you value your time whilst in the park to maximise your experience then there really isn't a choice. A lot of the waiting areas were not air conditioned or even provided fans so it was almost a 90 minute sauna session. The 4D shrek adventure was worth the 15 minutes of waiting time.

You can be waiting for over an hour at times to get on certain rides and that was on a Monday. Easy and cheap enough to just catch a taxi there.The food is a reasonable price, but water is expensive so I would take a bottle with.

review_314542334,“Never too old!”,"We were only in Singapore for 3 days ""passing through"" on our way from Sri Lanka to Indonesia and Universal Studios was pretty much the only activity we had planned in advance and it was such a great day!The MRT system is so reliable and relatively cheap so we were able to get there in time for the gates opening and avoid any huge queues (which pretty much goes for the entire day - we went on a Friday, I'm sure it would have been a different story at the weekend!). The day got off to an especially good start when my 23 year old boyfriend won the award for ""most excited guest"" (breaking children's hearts left, right and centre I should imagine) meaning we got 5 ""front of the line passes"" which came in very handy! I'm not sure if they run this little competition every day, but if they do, it's definitely worth throwing your dignity aside as the passes are 100% worth it!If you've ever been to Universal Studios California, this one is just as good; the rides are awesome and the park itself is stunning to walk around. The only thing Singapore doesn't have the California does is a movie studio tour. I couldn't point out a dull moment but my favourite ride by far was the Transformers 3D ride....absolutely incredible!! I'd been on it before in the US a couple of years ago and was praying it was going to be just as good here and I wasn't disappointed.

review_314525880,“Disappointing.”,"We were excited to visit & had previously only been to Universal in Los Angeles. Well, there's just NO comparison! Universal Singapore was small, had limited rides suited to teenagers & we ended up leaving after just 3 hours. That was plenty of time to do everything on offer, though as we were very fortunate to visit on a day when lines were minimal. My 14 year old did love the Revenge of the Mummy ride, which she did several times.We had a very nice lunch at the Oasis Spiced Cafe, where the air conditioning was a blessing & we easily found a table. The food was tasty & also reasonably priced.Even though we lived in Australia for many years, we really found the heat & humidity in Singapore oppressive and exhausting. For me, it's just not the ideal place to do an outdoor theme park unless you're really used to being outdoors in such heat & humidity combined.Would W&D visit there again? No. We'll definitely be leaving our Universal visits for when we're in LA due to the heat and the limited ride options in Singapore.

review_314435949,“Relatively small theme park that is fun depending on weather conditions”,"This is our second visit to this park, the last being 3-4 years ago. The crowd was definitely fewer but the quality of the rides and shows have somewhat dropped. However, I would not say that the park itself was poorly maintained, it is just that it is not well managed and I see no improvements (if at all there are now fewer attractions) since we last visited the place that will call for second time visitors to visit this park. During the time when we were there, there were fewer street shows and lesser chances of meeting any movie characters. But then again there was once we came across to what appeared to be an Asian like ""Marilyn Monroe"", which may not be exactly what you are looking for. This adds a negative point to the already relatively fewer attractions you would find in this park compared to others for the same price owing to the relatively small size of the park. Since the park is very dependent on weather conditions, it may be the case that you may have made plans many months ago and bought your ticket with hopes of having a good time. But then, at the first sign of clouds with not even a drop of rain, the park will close all its outdoor rides. it may be for safety reasons but this means that about 75% of all the attractions are no longer accesible. So, now you are stuck with just a few places to visit. Since the park is not so big either, your best bet would be going to the restaurants and shops which, in my opinion, is much costlier than Universal Studios in Los Angeles (of which I have visited twice as well). The management does not offer you a return pass due to bad weather which also suggests that for a park located in tropical wet weather country, it is very likely that you will have to face this condition again in your next visit. The visitors must be very aware that they are dependent on luck to either enjoy a good time with the family or have a very wet experience. When they visit this park with this in mind, perhaps the expectations would not be so high and therefore visitors are more willing to accept the short comings of the park. Since there was no chance of getting on some of the rides, one could consider coming back during the dry season. Maybe this is not so good a good idea as well.... as Singapore experiences very bad haze during this time, most likely due to the smog coming from neighboring Indonesia.So, as a whole what would you expect having visit this park? Expect to pay fairly high premium prices for a clean, not so crowded park and with a chance that many rides will not be available to you. Comparatively to other parks worldwide, expect to pay a lot more for the food and the goodies etc. The good side of this park is that it is located in Singapore, a safe place and well regulated. A small island that allows you to stay elsewhere conveniently at affordable rates, without having to depend on the nearby hotels which will cost you a bomb! There are also halal outlets which is a major plus point and the food is probably a lot tastier given its Asian cooking. As such visitors can expect to not get overloaded with sodas and deep-fried stuff you may find in many other parks elsewhere.

But now, I think it is just ok as compared to price they charge for it. Except for few rides say transformer, roller coaster and mummy rides, rest all are average. They have something like 19 rides and more than half of them are meant only for kids (and really kids only). So this leaves very few for adults. If u r coming from India, then I must say Imagica is better option. It has better rides than USS (except roller coaster which is better in USS) and quite appropriately priced.People with kids, one good thing in USS is that they have water points almost everywhere. Regarding tickets, try for online, I understand that they are cheaper and easily available. the line in studio will take around 30 minutes to 1 hour on a regular day.

I was lucky that the Battlestar Galactica ride was open (after it got closed for almost 2 years, according to my friends). My favourite ride was Revenge of The Mummy at Ancient Egypt. I've read rumours of how good Transformers-Ride was but, I prefer the Mummy. There are 2-3 rides saying you will be wet or possibly soaked, fret not. It was just a drizzle of water. You don't have to put your bag inside the paid-lockers (for wet rides) because the sun will help you dry up in a seconds. Unlike USJ, visitors aren't allowed to bring in food and drinks. But you can bring empty bottles and refill it in the park. The park opens at 10am and close at 6pm. Pretty short eh?

review_313904877,“Do not visit with young teenagers”,"Universal Studios promises a lot, but is terribly disappointing in reality. There are too few rides suited to young teenagers and above; thus the queues are horrendous. We visited on a quietish day and all of the main rides suited to teenagers (Transformers, Galactica, The Mummy) had minimum 60 minute waits. Oh, and when the sign says 60 minutes - try 90. It is quite clear that Universal are sweating this asset for all its worth. They get as many people through the door as possible and then make you wait and wait and wait to access the rides. In a six hour visit - we managed three rides on the showpiece attractions. Awful.They should either build more rides of significance or limit the number of people entering the park. Do not bother with Universal Studios Singapore unless you're happy to queue for hours - and I mean that literally.

review_313897597,“The endless queuing experience”,"After being the whole day in the park (10:00-19:00), with only 30 minutes break for lunch we were only able to try:- Sesame Street Spaghetti- Accelerator- Transformers: the ride- Battlestar Galactica: Cyclon- Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure- Shrek 4-D AdventureWhy? Because of the endless queues!Suggestion for future visitors: Get the express option. It will save you around 1 hour per attraction.In general, I think this park is extremely expensive and too crowded, therefore, I don't recommend it!For USS people, maybe if you limit the amount of people that can get into the park most users will be happy.Another solution may be to implement some kind of booking for the high demand rides so people will approach to the rides within a defined time window. That way you don't waste your time in the queues.

review_313869474,“Good Day Out ”,"We had a day at Universal Studios in September 2015 as a birthday celebration for one of my kids. It was a really enjoyable day. While we didn't go on all the rides - some were just too big and scary for a young child - there were plenty of other things to do to keep everyone entertained. Shrek 4D was pretty good fun, the Elmo ride was enjoyable and so was the Puss in Boots roller coaster. Everyone had a good time and the birthday celebration was a success.

review_313674760,“Great day out”,"Visited USS with two children aged 11 and 6. Had a great day and managed to experience most rides and attractions. We pre-purchased our tickets through a travel agent which saved us about 20% and also gave us meal and retail vouchers. Although we went on a school day we deliberately arrived 30 minutes early to queue and didn't bother with the express ticket. For the first couple of hours, wait times were mostly less than 10 minutes so we were able to access the popular rides before the crowds came. After lunch the wait times blew out to over 60 minutes for the most popular rides. The most exciting rides were the Transformers ride, both roller coasters and the Lost City ride. Our younger daughter enjoyed Puss in Boots and the Madagascar boat ride. The attractions are very well finished and the park is well organised. As with most theme parks, food and merchandise are pricey. Our USS visit was the highlight of our short stay in Singapore and is somewhere we would return.weremostly

Initially wanted to go to buy online from USS but found out from my friends that they managed to much better deals such as cheaper than online discount and has offer free transfer from their hotel to Sentosa. It makes a lot of differences in dollars , almost 20-30% cheaper than retail and offer much more. Like free gift and free shopping Voucher. This travel company is very well known in Hong Kong, Taiwan , China . They are Travel Delight Singapore. Very interesting is that they offer more than prices.. It services that really makes the difference. Free Pick up in hotel to USS and also they send the tickets to hotel reception (although at a small fees) which is negligent. Travel Delight also sell many attraction tickets at a good deal which makes the smart tourist delightful. Guess if you want, you just twist a thought in this and you know where to locate them.

My friends and I took our time exploring the park while others were running around trying to hit all the popular rides to beat the queue.

review_312866429,“Family fun day”,"Family trip to Singapore included a day at Universal Studios. Took the SMRT from Orchard to Harbour Front then switched to the Sentosa train. You can also walk across the covered bridge. Once there we took the obligatory picture in front of the rotating globe and lined up for tickets. Get to park park earlier in the day if you can. We got there at 11:00AM and there was quite a crowd already. We purchased the express pass and it was worth the extra fee. The first ride we went on had a 5 minute wait for express line and a 1 hour wait for regular line. Food places were expensive and crowded which I believe is normal for any theme park. The Battlestar Galatica ride was awesome with two separate coasters - Human and Cylon. It is probably best to start with Human side first as it is not so rough. The Cylon ride is undoubtedly harsher and throws you around plus it is inverted so your feet hang down. All in all, it was a great family day.

review_311244146,“Service reduction from year to year”,"This is my 3rd visit to Universal Studio Singapore, and it become disappointing from year to year. The good things are, new ride are introduced every year make an additional choice to try the new things when you revisit the park. Things that I dont like in the last visit:1. They close the park at 6PM. A year ago, the park is closed at 8PM and there is a firework at the closing time during weekend. Now, they divide the opening time into 2-stages. The daytime visitor and evening visitor for private event. After 6PM, we are not allowed to take a ride anymore and we are pushed to leave the park. The evening visitor crowd start to come at 5PM, so if you expect the park become less crowded during the evening, you make a big mistake.2. No more parade. Year ago, there was still a parade during the weekend.3. No more fireworks.The gesture from the ground staff also not good after 6PM. I still have kids queueing for Galactica. He start to queue before 6PM but probably still stuck inside due to long queue. I am waiting for him and they ask me to leave the park. My kids do not have any cellphone and we are foreigner in Singapore. They do not allow me to check to the queue, and do not want to give paging to check whether my kids is still in the queue or not. They dont care if my kids get lost. They just ask me to wait outside. Fortunately, my kids finally emerge from the attraction and we can gather again together. Anyway, the attraction is still attractive and I still consider to come again in the next coming years, since this is still considered as the better choice in the region.

review_311180632,“Good place for Adventure”,"There is easy connectivity to Sentosa from the city through MRT and buses. Going to universal studios is a full day trip especially if you love adventure rides. There is so much happening around in the place all day that you will get tired easily. The water show is amazing, don't miss it! The rides are good. The red and blue roller coaster ride will make you shout your lungs out. There is a cartoon character parade but that is only on Friday and Saturday in the evening. If you are a chocolate lover, the Hershey's store at the entrance of Universal studios will make you go crazy. During peak rush time, there is a waiting of around 65mins for every ride, which is an unnecessary time waste. If you happen to visit on such a crowded day and want to take all the rides, a priority pass can be purchased for an additional fees of SP $50. This will save you from standing in long queues.

review_311141193,“Fun for kids”,"We only spent half a day here, thats all we needed. Its not huge, and a lot of the rides my kids were not allowed on due to height restrictions. They still enjoyed it though!

review_311016517,“Expensive place but a must visit”,"Theme park for everyone. From shows to rides. Live performances to 3d shows. Food joints to children play area.Wholesome entertainment from 11 a.m to 6 p.m. after that they organize events for private companies and want you to leave early. They start closing areas. Ticket is expensive and waiting time is tooooooo much on rides with normal ticket. Go for express tickets if rides need to be enjoyed. Small place but loaded with activities.

review_310990693,“Great day out! ”,"We read other reviews and so avoided going on Sunday. We went on Monday and although it seemed busy the queues weren't too Bad. The longest we waited was an hour (red roller coaster) The water rapid queue said 30 minute wait but it wasn't even that. As people were leaving around 5pm there were no queues for any rides apart from the two roller coasters so we got a few rides in quick. The transformers ride is brilliant, the others seem to be over before they've even begun. Good entertainment for children. I don't know how much it was for express tickets, although I didn't mind a few half hour queues I would recommend these if possible to make the most of the day, especially if it's busy.

review_310961960,“amazing fun-filled day”,"what can I say - both adults & kids enjoyed the day thoroughly! had to be there earlier than the opening hours to buy tickets, and queue up for entry into the park. the adults loved the transformer and flying canopy ride. the kids were totally in love with the jurassic park water ride - it may seem ""boring"" to some, but the kids were excited to see dinosaurs along the ride & were dying to be in best position to get wet!!! we repeated this ride. the mummy ride & rollercoaster rides on the battlestar are not for the faint-hearted. yes, the lines were long at some attractions, but one can simply go to another attraction and return again to check-out the lines. compared to the lines at osaksa, the lines here were much more manageable. we found that the lines were not too long towards the closing hours (probably because the big tour groups had left by then). we managed to complete all the rides, but didn't get to watch the waterwold show. (the show was cancelled due to the hazy conditions.)

review_310875297,“Good if you are a kid with huge patience!!”,"the place was heavily crowded and most of the attractions has 45-60 minutes waiting time. the universal express was damn costly. the restaurants were overpriced and few of them served cold and seemingly stale food. the cracker show at 8:00 pm however was a highlight for otherwise a tiring day!!if you plan to visit, be at the gates when it opens as the queues would be lesser.

review_310865767,“Small”,"In comparison to Florida this is a very small park and with a fast pass can be done in a manner of hours. Some of the staff need to learn the meaning of customer service as some were quite rude. Would probably suit younger smaller children.

review_310844225,“Fun & Excited here!”,"This is my 2nd time in USS. You can enjoy with many playthings. My favorite is ""Transformer 3D ride"". Very fun and you can feel that you are sitting on ""Bumblebee"". 1 day is enough for me and my friends. There is parade of all charactor around 5pm or 5.30pm and it's nice.

review_310826366,“Have fun with friends”,"USS was one of funniest destinatinations i experienced in Singapore. Ideally you should go with your friends. There are many interesting place. Only one thing to complain, it was one of busiest place so you'd better go early in the more ning. For each games in the studio, you have to queue for long time, so make sure you bring water and snacks. Luckily, my singaporean friends bought vouchers for us so it just took 50sing dollars for every games and lunch.

review_310802151,“Just great”,"As a huge lover of theme parks, I would have adored this place whether it was a five star experience or not, but it totally was!The park opened at 10am, we arrived pretty early thanks to speedy transport. The monorail was great, we wanted to do the cable car but we heard it was much more expensive. Puss In Boots turned up just before the park opened and high-fived the crowd! A nice touch. The staff also gave a kid one of those express passes (competition for who could scream the loudest).So glad we didn't buy one of those as the longest queue was only 30 minutes for the Jurassic Park Rapids- this is definitely the most popular ride so do this one as early as you possibly can! We hit the big rollercoaster first and queued less than 5 minutes for both tracks. Even my boyfriend who isn't keen on rides had a great day. There is something for everyone here. I got a photo with the minions! The Mummy ride and the Transformers Simulator are excellent.Couple of suggestions- when the ride is deserted the staff should let you ride again without having to go all the way around again- this wouldn't harm anybody and would be great customer service. Also, everything (shops, etc) should still be open even in low season. We have all paid the same price and shouldn't have to miss out on anything during this once in a lifetime experience! I've done Universal before in the U.S. - but how many times will I get to Singapore?! Who knows. We didn't stay until closing time as we managed to do everything by 3pm- but there should be a closing show- fireworks? Something?Also- we get that theme parks are expensive but $20 dollars for the cheapest photo is absolutely extortionate! Just take your own.Tip: my bag wasn't searched- I don't think this is encouraged but bring your own snacks! Obviously theme park food prices are pretty steep- but how awesome that the adults can buy beer?!I think Far Far Away Land was my favourite. I love Shrek (well the 1st movie at least) and there's the huge castle here. The 4D show is alright but takes a long time to actually get into the auditorium...definitely only a one time ride. The Puss In Boots ride is great! The smaller rollercoaster here is good too.We loved the Flyer ride in Jurassic Park- so much fun- forwards and backwards!Was a bit of a pain having outdoor rides closed for a bit but obviously the park cannot control the weather. It was very rainy and hazy yesterday!Loved all the Sesame Street stuff. The show was cute and only 15 minutes.A great day for kids and big kids!
