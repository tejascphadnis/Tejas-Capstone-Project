review_310773474,“AMAZING JUST AS GOOD AS LA MAYBE EVEN BETTER”,"Me and my wife got a one day pass and express pass for the rides. Luckily we came on a quiet day and lines were fast anyway. It rained when we got there but still most rides are covered and walking around the park was mostly covered as well. We have got to the LA universal studios before and I would rate the singapore one as good if not better. It is extremely well themed and the rides are awesome.For food try the old time diner the hamburgers are amazing. WE LOVED OUR DAY AT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS SINGAPORE, and plan to return with our little kids sometime in the future. Everyone is so friendly and helpful. For international travels take a photocopy of your passport or a screenshot of it as they will refund the 7% tax you spend in everything in the park if you spend over $200.

review_310411301,“Good time was had by all”,"Why write a review on this place as there are so many? I'll write it from a Westerners perspective with 3 kids aged 7, 6, 7months. Firstly, we loved it. So easy to get to using the MRT & Mono-Rail to Sentosa. The Mono-Rail is free but there is a S$4/person entry fee to the park or free if you walk the boardwalk. Take small change as the machine doesn't accept big money or five change over $4 (this is the same for the MRT)Getting there it was hot. Sticky hot with no water rides to cool the kids so lots of water. Being westerners (from Australia) I was surprised that we seemed to be the only ones and that a lot of people stare, point & take photos of our 7 month old son. Maybe it's because he has blonde hair. When walking keep to the right. In lines for food etc. don't stand back as people will just rush in and it seems rude at first but it's just a difference in culture. I found the food & Merchandise to be resonantly priced and was delighted at the 10% discount we got at food and retail vendors for using MasterCard. I kept thinking they were about to charge more when you got your MasterCard out. We also got a better booking online using it. We went on a Tuesday to negate the weekend crowds and the longest we waited for a ride was 40 mins & they have boards out the front of the lines to tell how long the wait is which was great. Some rides we only waited 5mins which was also great.The best ride was the Jurassic Park boat ride. As much for the water at the end to cool you down as for it was a great ride. My boy 7 & girl 6 loved it. I was a little worried she may freak out but seemed ok on the other rides. The drop at the end is cool and once it was over she was fine. And the Transformers 4D ride which I loved and so did the kids. Again worried about the age of my daughter but she closed her eyes a few times as it was scary but loved the falling feeling etc. of the ride and went twice. Although it left my wife who gets travel sickness feeling a little woozy. I'm glad we have done it but won't go back again, especially if it was hotter or more crowded. Also height was not a problem as they were both over the limits but check on line to see the restrictions as some might miss out on some rides. There are plenty of places to park your pram at each ride but babies can't go on many rides & you need to accompany kids between 1.00-1.22m tall

review_310350155,“Day full of fun!!!”,"I went to USS last week..... And enjoyed the rides to the fullest..... majority of rides are roller coasters.... best being the transformers, mummy, lost world, human.....Queues were not very long (that being a weekday) except for few most famous rides mentioned above where waiting time extended till 40 min.Light, camera, action was good show to watch...Many rides offer a separate queue for single riders {good way to beat the long queues if you haven't bought the express pass ;) }..... In nutshell, spent a good day there.Tip: Go there with light stomach if you want to enjoy roller coasters.Few rides need you to keep your bags in locker (rents apply)

review_310018940,“Only for the Young”,"We were a couple in our early 60's on a stop over in Singapore with our 34 year old son who is Epileptic. We were disappointed with Universal Studios as there wasn't much we could do but just walk through the place. Our son couldn't go on the rides and we don't like rides. I really wanted to see this attraction hoping there would be a road train or boat ride that could take us through various movie sets but no nothing like that at all just rides and more rides. Very disappointed in that regard for the cost of entry. What we walked through was pretty good but it was boring if you couldn't do anything but walk and look.

review_309763222,“Fun for everyone! ”,"We visited Universal Studios in Sentosa. We went by monorail from VivoCity ($4 each person). Upon arrival there was a bit of a queue to buy tickets, but there was a buzz in the line of everyone's excitement. When we purchased our tickets, we paid a little extra for EXPRESS. This gave us the chance to skip the line once for every ride in the amusement park. Considering there were wait times of 110+ mins and closures of the outdoor rides (for an hour or two) from severe inclement weather, the express ticket proved to be worth the extra money!Remember to wear enclosed shoes (or you'll be taking your shoes on and off for each ride! Also, the lockers near the Battlestar Galactica rollercoasters (Cyclon & Human) had free locker use for 2hrs, as some rides you wont be able to take any items with you.If it does happen to rain and/or rides are closed, visit the Shrek 4D movie in Far Far Away and that will occupy you for about 1/2 hr - the weather should have passed by that time - if not at least you've been out of the weather! Transformers ride is a MUST! But try to get on all the rides, no matter how silly they may seem!

review_309670968,“Fun begins here!”,"It was a normal Saturday weekend at the USS. As expected queues are long and waiting times for the most popular rides will range from 90mins to 140mins. Idea for attraction goers how to cut these waiting times? Opt to use the ""Singe-riders"" queue. it will only take you lesser time about 25mins (for the Transformers: The Ride) waiting to get into the ride. The down side is that you and your friends will be surely separated but, if you are lucky, you'll end up sitting in one gondola. :) Plus the ride itself is fun and you'll immerse yourself with what you are seeing! Best rides to try at USS? No brainer --- Transformers, The Mummy and the Galactica (though we were not able to try this but surely will when I get back!)

review_309669343,“Amazing Day”,"We had the most amazing day here. While a lot of the rides were too wild for me to try, we had two adrenaline junky teenagers with us who had a ball - we had a great time just watching them enjoy themselves. We did however brave the Transformers ride and this was mind blowing. So clever. Take lots of water though - it can get really hot. Food also not quite as expensive as we expected it to be.

review_309639084,“Must visit in Singapore ”,"My wife and I went to Universal Studios on a weekend and arrived there at about 9:30am for a 10am opening. Upon arrival the place is great and we were both like kids in a sweet shop! It was very busy and the queues to get in the park were very long so we knew we would have a long day stood queuing for rides. This was when my wife had a brain wave, we decided to buy an express pass for $50 each. The express pass was the best buy we made, it got up into the park super fast and took us to the front of every single ride. The pass entitled us to 1 express queue jump per ride and boy did we use it. If we hadn't of got the express pass we could have been spending up to 80 minutes getting on a ride! It's definitely worth buying. All the rides are great and worth jumping on however if I had queued for some of them for over 80 minutes I might have been rather annoyed. There is lockers in the park to put your valuables in when you go on rides and some that offer it free for a certain amount of time. I thought items in the park such as food, drink was quite reasonable. It was really a great day and rather than tell you about every bit I would rather let you enjoy it yourself when you go. You can even go out the park and come back in again if you require and that's free. It's a must visit in Singapore and my wife and I haven't laughed as much in ages. Tip - buy the express queue jumper and you won't regret it.

We got there on the Sentosa express it was all very straightforward, the first ride we did was the Madagascar ride there was a long que for this but was worth it my 6 year old enjoyed it thoroughly being a Madagascar fan. We did the shrek 4d, Puss in Boots (very long ques) but a good ride, transformers ride was the best one a must ques were not too big for this.

Also had an opportunity to have photo with Shrek and Fiona. Also amazed at the giant-sized transformers, dinosaur at Jurassic Park and Ancient Egypt.

review_309188901,“Expected more!”,"There are not a lot of rides or attractions here for a Universal Studios. We enjoyed it but 2 rides in particular need sorting out. Human and Cyclone. The staff working in these rides grant 100% priority to those who have the 'express pass'...now this is used on the other rides too but in turn. Like it should be. It makes a mockery of the park when you see people sitting down in a queue...please visit Alton Towers in the UK for how the express pass works. Nevertheless, some rides were good but probably wouldn't go again for the price

review_309111996,“Fun filled day with the little ones!”,"Amazing park for all ages. Great rides and attractions. Would be great if we were given a map of the park at the entrance to be able to plan our walk around the park better.Halal food quite hard to find, you need to get to the Ancient Egypt food court for food. Some of the meet and greet characters are out only for short time.The Sesame street character that came out spent on average about 10 - 15 mins. The person looking after the characters would shout out the remaining number of people allowed to take photos with the character to discourage other people queuing. The Transformers are out for much longer for photo session- almost 30 minutes. The queues are not so long when we were there. You can also buy the Express Queue pass for an additional fee to get into the Priority queue. We loved the 4D movie in Far Far Away, and there's also a small ferris wheel ride in the Curio shop for Far Far Away land. Great for keeping the kids occupied whilst you shop for souvenirs without having to chase after the kids.

review_308919349,"“Awesome Rides, Well Organized Themed Park”","When in Singapore, you should definitely check out Universal Studios at least once. Yes it's one of the most expensive attractions here, but it's well worth the money you pay. Despite the large crowds and long queues, the staff did a great job in keeping everyone and everything organized. The rides are thrilling and exceeded my expectations of what I thought was possible for a ride, you definitely shouldn't miss the Transformers 3D ride, Revenge of the Mummy roller coaster, and the Battlestar Galactica roller coasters. These rides aren't suitable for young children, but Universal Studios has something that caters to all ages, so they'll find enjoyment in the Madagascar and Far Far Away sections.I regret not getting the express pass, which is a worthy investment, considering how long I spent waiting in the regular queues for the rides (some over an hour like the Battlestar), even though I went early before they even opened the gates at 10am. Many people are there early, so you should plan what rides you want to do in advance, and aim to finish riding all the major ones, before you stroll around later to take photos. I also heard that same day re-entry is possible, so you could technically go out to dine / rest outside before heading back in, but remember that Universal Studios closes at 7pm.

review_308849984,“USS Revisit”,"Passes for USS was purchased online at earlier date. Mine was a season pass and my partner's a SG$64 one-day pass (n.p. SG$74). They claimed that they have a limited number of passes daily but you can try your luck and buy from the counters near the entrance.Main areas in the USS:- Hollywood (street entertainment, meet & greet with characters)- New York (plenty of photo op)- Sci-Fi City (Battlestar Galactica & Transformers rides, meet & greet)- Ancient Egypt (The Mummy ride .::FAV!::., meet & greet)- The Lost World (Jurassic Park rapid ride .::FAV!::.) , rock climbing, Waterworld show, dino meet & greet)- Far Far Away (Shrek 4D adventure, Donkey LIVE, Enchanted Airways, street entertainment, ice cream!)- Madagascar (merry go round, crate adventure, street entertainment)We returned for the new attraction - Puss In Boots Giant Journey!It looked tame but quite exciting. Definitely not as lame as I initially expected.A one-day visit isn't enough. The season pass (6-month validity) is SO worth the investment if one live nearby. Since I don't, I had to be contented with 2 separate visits using the season pass. Still cheaper than buying 2 one-day pass!***P.s. Taking the monorail back to Vivo City at 6ish seemed like a nightmare. It was Monday but the queue was so long, it extended out of the station. So, we decided to go downstairs where the buses are and get a cab to the airport.I also took the opportunity to explore sentosa island.

review_308785434,“Well that was fun...”,"I was skeptical at first -- ""a theme park? isn't that stuff for kids and serial killers?"" I asked. But the significant other insisted, and so I was dragged to Sentosa island (9 hours before a flight, might I add). The weather was hot and humid, the place looked expensive and the children were out on field trips. We started with the Madagascar ride -- okay, not bad, good way to generate some nostalgia. Then there was the Shrek 4D experience which was quite cool, then the Puss in Boots Giant Journey (or whatever it's called) which was also pretty cool -- THEN THERE WAS THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN RIDE WHICH I JUST WASN'T PREPARED FOR -- then there was the Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase which, in my opinion, was the best part (it's the kid in me that loved it) and then there was the Lights, Camera, Action which was spectacular --- anyway, don't let me spoil it for you. It was well worth it. I'd go back again and spend much longer. I didn't even get to go on the Transformers ride, or the Battlestar Galactica rollercoaster (which looked terrifying).

You're in line together, although you don't get to ride together a you fill an empty spot on each ride. Most we had to wait was about 5 minutes.

(We decided if it all got too bad we would upgrade our tickets to VIP's to get us to the front of queues, which you can do at several places once you are in the park - no need on a Monday it turned out.Headed first for the roller-coaster with only a short wait. Queuing got progressively longer as the day went on - but only up to 35 minutes. Lots to do, heaps happening all over the place, not a huge theme park but seriously good fun. Thought the food was pretty reasonably priced - cheaper than in town. Did most things, had a beer and were done by 3pm - great day out.

review_308436370,“Fun park jam-packed with many rides for all ages”,"Come to the theme park first thing in the morning about 15 minutes before opening time so that you can be the first in line. This is strongly advised as there would be many people queuing at the exact opening time. The moment you step into the theme park, DO NOT waste your time snapping pictures unless you really need to as you paid the money so ride the rides first. You can always take pictures afterwards if you want anytime. We went around the theme park in this order:1. Sci-fi city2. Far far away3. The lost world4. Madagascar5. Hollywood6. New York Key rides that you should go-Battlestar Galactica (No. 1 on the list)-Transformers Ride -Mummy ride (scary for kids as many kids cried during the ride)-Puss in Boots-Enchanted Airways-Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (Bring your ponchos and extra clothes as we were soaking wet after the ride. Try to bring your own even though the theme park provides a machine where you can buy ponchos for a dollar or so)Key shows-Waterworld (a mind-blowing stunt show! Try to use your poncho as you might get soaking wet by surprise splashes during the show. But how wet you get depends on which zone you sit so choose the right zone)-Shrek 4D ( effects are quite realistic! Don't underestimate the show)How to get there: BY TRAINTake the North-east line (purple line) or Circle line (yellow line) to Harbourfront Station. Take Exit E to VivoCity and proceed to level 3 to board the Sentosa express. Alight 1 stop later at Waterfront station. WALKING FORM THE STATIONInstead of taking the Sentosa express, you can save a few dollars by walking there via the Sentosa boardwalk which is a short walk from the train station. BUSAfter taking the train, go to VivoCity and board the bus RWS8 from bus stop 14141 or bus stop 14121 at Merrill Lynch, Harbourfront. Alight at Resorts World Sentosa Drop-off point. Enter via the forum and turn left to take the escalator up to level Turn left again and walk straight till you see the Universal Studios GlobeFood:Food at the theme park is expensive. Therefore, bring your own food there. We made sandwiches to bring there. You can also buy ready to eat meals from 7 eleven in VivoCity that you can ehat up and bring. If you don't mind the cost of the food, buy them as they are delicious too especially the eatery at Far far away called ""Goldilocks"". The chicken was delicious. It was a happy place despite the hot weather and the relatively long queues for some rides. Will be back! :)

Without doubt, the best ride i have ever been on.If you are willing to fork out some money, very strongly recommend buying the 'Express' pass. Will save you at least 2.5-3hrs in the queues. Suggest you buy them early - because the rates for the Express pass keep increasing as the day progresses and crowds increase.A must do in Singapore..

review_308364431,“Nice!!”,"We were a family of 2 adults 2 children and an. Infant .we went on a week day thinking we might get little less crowd but were wrong . The biggest and only problem is the cues for rides . I would diffinetly recommend people with young children to get the express pass which we did and it was much easier with kids as we didn't had to wait for any of the cues . Food inside universal studios was very average nothing much .The water show is a must which starts at 4.30 it was really nice .the weather is normally quite hot in singapore so you need to keep yourself and others with you hydrated. They have water dispensers all over the park where you can refill your bottles . Overall it was a wonderful experience and kids loved it . My personal favorite 2 rides were the Mummy and Transformers.

review_308276554,“Universal adventure”,"Having travelled to both Universal Studios in Florida and California we were looking forward to a different take on a familiar attraction, We arrived 10am and spent until closing enjoying the attractions and rides. The rides are not as serve as America and the and lesser in number, the park is a lot smaller, easier to manage in one day. The variety of rides was good and suited a varied age groups. The queues were average but moving all the time. All shows are in English with all the staff speaking English. There is a good variety of restaurants to choose from. We loved the Puss In Boots ride and the Shrek 4D show was very funny. As usual Transformers the ride did not disappoint and was the best ride in the park in our opinion.

However you will need to be ready to wait for over an hour for each ride even during the week unless you buy a Universal Express pass that brings the time down to 5 to 10 mins per ride. It costs 50 Singapore Dollars but is totally worth it.

I enjoy the photo time with the characters... that is cool! Good place to hangout with friends! Bring your water bottles and you can re-fill it all over the park! Put sunblock on or suffer sunburn!

review_307837671,“An amazing day out with great fun!!!”,"Universal studio is one of the best places to visit whilst your stay in Singapore they have the best attractions, rides and entertainment. the shows were really great to watch especially the Donkey one in Far Far Away. The different Food courts were good however the gift shops were a bit pricey which is expected. The down side was the fact that we didn't meet the characters from each section hence I would suggest USS should have times when they come and still for a bit long. Also it would be great for USS to have longer opening hours since there is so much to do! Overall great day out with the family!!!

review_307687319,“Top Tips for Universal Studios”,"RIDES: For adults and older kids, the best rides by far are the CYLON Battlestar Gallactica and THE MUMMY rides. Excitement plus!! If you get there early I would do these first then try again at the end of the day - that tends to be when wait times are lowest. Next layer are Transformers, Humans and the Jurassic Park rapids. But I would say most rides in the park are worth doing once. EXPRESS PASS: It is extremely expensive, essentially doubles the cost of the tickets but if you can stretch to it I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND you get Express Passes. You can get through the busy rides in 5-10 minutes vs up to an hour or more at busy times - so you can get through 3-4 times as many rides in a day - so think of it as getting through 2 days worth in 1 day!! There is a slightly cheaper version that lets you do every ride without a wait, but only once for each ride. This only saves you $20 vs the full express pass but may be a good option if you intend to go on every ride as you can then get a 2nd ride on the best rides early or late when the lines are down a bit. SHOWS: As far as shows are concerned, Waterworld is worth doing. Note there are wet seats, splash seats and dry seats. If you sit in the wet seats, prepared to be wet as the performers take this to heart, especially during the warm-up performance. The surprise of the day however was THE CRUISERS by Mel's Drive-in - great singers doing Billy Joel, Franki Valli etc. Highly recommend you catch these guys - kids & adults really enjoyed. When you go in, make a note of the times for these shows as they are only on once or twice during the day. EXIT PLAN: Its chaos when the park empties, the taxi queue was miles long, so have an exit plan. If you know how to book a taxi in Singapore you can try that. Another option is to stay for dinner, there is a huge range of options outside the park. You can take your time, we ate quickly and still faced a very long wait. We ended up catching the monorail to the train station and taking the train from there. All in all a fun day, enjoyed by kids and adults alike.

review_307677727,“BOSS DAY OUT!”,"I was a little bit skeptical about going after reading some reviews on wait times etc... But, What a day out! Buy your tickets in advance with Asiaholiday I think it is, you pick your discounted tickets up from resorts world (5 minute walk from the main gate). I'd line up from 9.40 atleast to be at the front. The wife and I ran to the transfromers ride first, then battle star human ride, followed by the mummy, all ridden within 30 minutes! our longest wait was the cylon ride on battle star but was still only 30 minutes, this was due to the ride being closed for maintenance and reopening (which always draws a crowd). Along with the tickets you get $5 off food inside, the Egyptian spice restaurant near the mummy ride was delicious, hit it up!! don't miss the shrek 4D show or the water show, great viewing! Enjoy your day out!!!

We bought the Express passes, and boy was it a great thing to do. We were waiting no longer than 10 minutes for some of the rides that were queuing for an hour.There are not a great number of attractions relative to the major UK parks, but the close proximity to each other of the rides, compact attraction and quality of rides actually made it a very pleasant experience. The Jurassic Park ride was a hit for my 9 year old son, and The Mummy was my 15 year old daughters highlight.

review_307321601,“What a fantastic day!”,"Do not even think about coming here without purchasing an express pass. We would have walked past 300 people waiting for rides every time, and we were on straight away for only $30 extra - totally worth it, especially with kids. When it is hot, the last thing you want to do is stand around waiting an hour to go on a carousel!Everything was new and clean and really well maintained. The best rides were the Battlestar Galactica, Transformer and Mummy rides - all must dos.Good value that under 4's are free, which is good considering that our 3 yr old missed out on quite a few rides.Food is incredibly expensive - so brace yourself for this because you don't have much of a choice. We brought some snacks in and you can bring water too. There are water bubblers everywhere in the park and the toilet facilities were all excellent.One thing to note is that there isn't a water park here, just in case you were expecting one!

review_307277826,“Mini-Universal”,"Do not expect anything on the scale of Universal Studios Orlando. This is far smaller and only has two roller coasters (which are good). The transformers ride is also pretty good but most of the other rides are aimed at the younger, less thrill seeking visitors. We were there on a relatively quiet day and the queues were lengthy and slow moving. We had fast passes which helped but effectively doubled the admission price and this is not a cheap day out.The good thing here is that you can have lots of fun as it has that happy vibe about the place.

A must - if you can afford it - go for the VIP Tour. 5 hours guided tour front of every queue and a choice of where to sit on rides.

review_306897459,“Mesmerising USS”,"Absolutely dream come true place. Well planned from ticketing to entry to rides. Many windows for ticketing so even during the rush hours not long queues. The park starts at 10am and we were there by 9.30am and the queue of entry were perfect and the volunteers were managing it so well. Each volunteer had plenty of park maps so when in queue you can plan your trip inside. Sharp at 10am the park opened & WOW Hollywood street was ready to welcome. Pair rollercoasters of Battlestar Galactica were the first rides for us. We were lucky to travel in the first trip of the day. Cylon roller coaster has suspended seats and so your legs are free in the air.It has a fall in the ground tunnel of mist. Many turns and twists are heartstopping. Once you have enjoyed Cylon you will find Human much easier. Ofcourse it is a roller coaster so twists and turns are amazing.This one has more speed in the ride and so fun. The next stop was Transformer,Sci-fi,3D Rollercoaster ride. Amazing thrill & feel.60 minutes waiting queue is worth and we did it twice. The Lost world, The Mummys have thrilling rides. Puss in boots & Madagascar were disappointing. Canopy flyer and Enchanted Airways are good for young kids, Shrek 4D movie is fun. While Lights ,Camera ,Action & Water Show(Don't remember the exact name) next to Lost World are very informative & interesting,both are must see for all. Sesame Street for young kids is fun. New York & Hollywood street stores are good. And many eateries serving variety of foods. We found Indian food in Madagascar food court.

We opted for the express upgrade so you get preference for the rides. Well worth the money. Food wasn't expensive in the park which I found surprising. There are lots of toilets and dining options. The souvenir shopping is also quite good, not too expensive. They also have a great family centre just inside the entry gates. They have feeding rooms, cold and hot water, baby change facilities and a microwave. The immediate area outside Universal Studios is surrounded by lots of shops and restaurants and things to do and see. It was very easy to get a taxi back to our hotel.

In the queue for one of the roller coasters for over one and half hours to hear a public announcement that there was a ""short delay as the ride was temporarily suspended"". The short delay resulted in a further announcement 30 minutes later stating there was now a ""technical problem"" and the ride was closed down!! I have been fortunate enough to visit the 2 universal theme parks in America (florida and Los Angeles) and had a much better experience. Would never return to this one.

Had to wait for tickets in the baking heat with baby. Asked staff if there was a priority line so the baby could avoid the heat, straight answer was no without any appolgy. Not particularly friendly.

review_306311392,"“Very average experience, nothing wow me!”","I would rate uss singapore at best average! It was extremely hot when I was there! Felt like I was baking under the hot sun! Overpriced food & drinks! Toilets are rather dirty, smelly and not well matained! Staff were not very smiley too! It is a theme park so I expected much better service but was a little disappointed in that! Other than the waterworld show which was very gd btw, the other shows were unimpressive and meh esp the donkey live show! No wonder so many ppl left halfway during the other shows when I was there. What I find really disturbing is the no of ppl here who have been complaining abt the express queue if u are so unhappy queuing up in the normal queue then pls do yourself a big favour and go and buy the express pass. They can be found in almost all the souvenier shops thruout uss fyi! If u intend to save the money and rather queue up instead, then pls do not say anything cos those ppl in the express queue pay very gd money for it like $50 to $70 depending on whether u are getting the limited or unlimited express pass! It is extremely unfair tt those in the normal queue keep on complaining abt tge long queues and I really do not understand why and what are they complaining about. If you do not wish to pay the extra money to be in the express queue then pls quit complaining here for goodness sake! The express pass comes at a hefty price tag(not like it is free like tt) and is necesssary and highly recommended to skip the super long queues if you want to enjoy all the rides in uss esp if u only have one day there! But I must add on too tt uss is also too greedy to keep on admitting ppl to the park! There shd be a limit to the no of ppl each day! Overall not highly recommended but ok if u have not been to any uss before!

review_306297696,“Exciting but be prepared !”,"All the attractions are exciting and well maintained. Our kids enjoyed the ▸ Puss In Boots' Giant Journey▸ TRANSFORMERS The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle ▸ Shrek 4-D Adventure▸ Amber Rock Climb▸ Enchanted Airways and several other rides PLAN: There are plenty of attractions to engage multiple age-groups. As a parent you might be lost on which to choose. Research online. You can view a map herehttp://www.rwsentosa.com/language/en-US/Homepage/Attractions/UniversalStudiosSingapore/USSMapAdvise: Sit and plan with your kids on the NOT-TO-MISS attractions few days prior to your visit. Also few attractions might be closed for renovation. Check before booking your tickets. KIDSThere are height restrictions for several rides (105 cm & 120 cm). Check the guidehttp://www.rwsentosa.com/Portals/0/RWS%20Revamp/USS/Visitor%20Info/USS-Riders_Guide_EN-May2015.pdfOur daughter missed several rides. The people who manage the rides are very strict and go by the rule book. Don't waste time arguing.Advise: Plan in advance and take the kids only to the rides they are allowed -- or better wait and come when your kid has reached that height.ATTIREWe went in Aug 2015. Long queues for certain attractions might be winding on the road. No overhead cover for the lanes. It was hot and humid. Advise: Take umbrella if going in summer. Dress light and casual. If you are planning on water rides such as or Jurassic Park Rapids or WaterWorld be prepared to get splashed. Take plastic covers. Have spare clothes for your kids. RUSH / CROWD: It was national holiday when we visited and the place was crowded as the day progressed. Though its well laid out, be prepared for the rush. Advise: Take the Universal Express pass. Warning: Its valid for a ride only once.FOOD:There are plenty of choices for non-vegetarians. However, if you are vegetarian choices are pretty basic. Advise: Take parathas and sandwiches as they are easy to carry. You can refill your water bottles from any of the several drinking fountains sprinkled all over the place.PHOTOS:At $20 per print the local photo options are expensive. For family and social media sharing our iphone 6 was good enough. Advise: If you want quality shots, take a SLR. Warning: You would be guarding the SLR and missing the fun in the rides.All in all - great place to enjoy with family. Plan well. Have fun !

review_306172889,“Entertainment Unlimited”,"Universal Studios was the first attraction that was penned in our itinerary by my children (the Shrek fans). We selected a Monday as we wanted the least amount of crowds and got there early just as they opened the gates. The park is well laid out and marked so you can chalk out all the rides and shows you are interested in doing. Except for the new and popular rides we did not have to wait for too long for entry to the other rides. We liked the Transformers 4D, the Curse of the Mummy and the Rapids Adventure rides the most. The children loved meeting Shrek & the gang and the best time they had was at the Shrek 4D movie. There are a lot of places to grab your bites and also to replenish you water. One day is enough to cover the full park.

review_306137043,“One fun day in USS with friends.”,"I went to Universal Studios Singapore with a bunch of friends and we had a wonderful day there. We went early in the morning and we spend the whole day until 8:00pm to catch the firework show. It was Saturday, 30th August 2015 and we were expecting a huge crowds. However, it may be our lucky day as the crowd is not as we are expecting. We were able to try out all the rides that catches our interest. So, express pass is not needed. The waiting line that we have to wait is 50 minutes at most. But, since it is a moving line, we did not feel the long wait. We really enjoyed all the rides. The cylon roller coaster was definitely our favorites. The transformer rides and Revenge of the Mummy is also rides not to be missed. However, we were not able to catch some of the shows and street entertainment. I think the meet&greet should be prolonged for more than 15 minutes if there are many peoples queuing. We were towards the end of the line to take photo when the helper cut the line to take the characters away. This will be definitely one of the reasons for me come back again one day.

review_305844337,“considerably small compared to other theme parks but still fun”,"We visited Universal Studios Singapore on a Monday afternoon, and though the park still had quite a large number of people inside, I believe it was still way better than being there on a weekend. Waiting time for the rides were between an average of 5-30 minutes, with the exception of the cyclon ride which had a mind-blowing waiting time of 120 minutes, and this was on a weekday. I couldn't imagine how that ride could eat your time on a weekend. It was however admittedly an exciting ride, but going through all that waiting time should make you think twice. For us, we did the cyclon ride last, so we wouldn't waste our time and end up missing the other rides and shows in the park. There's a Malaysian hawker just outside the park's entrance, where you could grab a decent and fairly priced meal. The park also has a lot of food choices should you prefer to eat inside. A few notes for those who have plans to visit this theme park: 1) Grab a separate copy of the show schedules before you start going around the park, as these schedules are not written in the park map.2) Picture taking with the characters have short time limits. It is best to watch the scheduled show of your character of choice, then fall in line right away for a photo op with them after the show. 3) The star parade is only on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. If this is a highlight you don't want to miss, then consider visiting on a weekend. If lesser crowd is your priority, you might prefer visiting on a weekday instead. 4) If you wish to experience the cyclon ride, do it last. As the waiting time will eat up a lot of your time -- warning: not an exaggeration. Overall, we enjoyed Universal Studios Singapore. It's definitely just a junior theme park compared to the ones in the US, but indeed not short on the fun factor. :)

review_305809176,“Disappointed. Just another theme park.”,"As a 9 year old, I had visited the Universal Studios in California in the 80s. I remember the Star Trek experience, the Knight Rider vehicle, the Miami Vice stunt show, the Wild West stunt show, the animal show, the Backlot, the studio tram tour where we saw Jaws, Kingkong and experienced an earthquake. The human interaction and the special effects were what made Universal Studios stand out - but not here in Singapore.Universal Studios Singapore fall short of any of the 'scenes' I witnessed as a child. What's the thrill of riding a themed ride for a minute or two? What a real pity that Universal Studios let themselves simply join the bandwagon of attraction parks. It's as if there aren't enough of them anywhere.For young children, 'Meet and Greet' character events remain a thrill. Minions were a favourite. Live performances are crowd pleasers too. We enjoyed the Rockafellas Streetboys performance. Kudos to the talents from the Philippines who brought down the house.Lights! Camera! Action! was the highlight for me. Steven Spielberg's artistry was just so real - it made me poor little ones cry! Amazing stuff. For this reason, I give an extra point to an otherwise poor rating.Conveniences and facilities: plenty of food kiosks and restaurants serving good quality food; toilets are too few; buggies/double buggies/wheelchairs/electric vehicles are all available for rent; these guarantee a pleasant day out in USS. Thankfully, there is no worry for these things to get misplaced or lost. Yes, Singapore is very safe :).Any last words? Struggling to see what Singapore can offer to the discerning tourist... I was hoping USS was one of them.

review_305630471,“Universal with 7 year old twin boys ”,"We went to universal studios last week during our 4 days visit to Singapore. Wish someone had told us to buy the express tickets where queue times are less as although we were there mid week the normalLineups at every ride were so long that couple of times we had to queue, wait more than an hour than give up as lines were moving too slowly. My boys really wanted to do the jeep ride at Egyptian section but we were disappointed about queue and it seems unfair when someone else is in another shorter queue and ends up doing the rides thou u have waited longer. Kids get dissapointed and don't understand that. Also felt that although the whole experience as a whole was so awesome we found the food to be not only overpriced but of poor quality. Had lunch at Egyptian food stall. Pittas were so hard you could hardly bite in. Rest of food seemed to be refried and oily. No healthy fruit / salad options anywhere. Similar experience we had at the icecream stall near transformer ride. Absolute rip off and bad stuff. As these guys are aware that there are no options open to you they serve you inferior overpriced food. Also we were not aware that the waterworld closes earlier and when we got there around 5.30 we were told its closed. We should have been informed at the main gate Bd would have done it earlier. The transformer ride was great. We did it twice. Overall super experience but wish we were told what times the shows happen etc so we don't miss out. Shall be back again to do whatever we missed out on and more.

review_305600268,“Amazing Universal.”,"The highlight of our trip to Singapore. We entered early just as the park opened to avoid the lines and the crowd. But most people had a similar idea. Advice is to do the rides and attraction before stopping to see the characters and shopping areas. Food is limited choice and once the crowd gets in is very difficult to get. We ate at the diner in Hollywood area. The transformers ride and the rollercoaster are the best. Mummy ride is also very good. Lots of walking to do so be prepared and don't carry too much as most rides don't allow carry ons. With Children is a little difficult if they are very small. Our 2 year old was exhausted from all the waiting and we had to exit the park to drop him off. Thanks to staying on the island we got a reentry and finished off the balance rides on the single rider lines. Single rider needs to be advertised so people are aware. Crowds are crazy and its best to not go on Weekends. Be prepared to get wet on certain rides.

Apparently can be up to $20 cheaper to buy online than when you arrive ($50 p.p). Check it out first. Some queues had an 85min wait. Longest for us was 5mins. Most popular rides are to the right after entering, also the scariest. Majority of rides suitable for kids, some with acceleration and slight drops, but not freefall. Advised my daughters to scream when about to drop and that alleviated the weightlessness feeling. Water world Show was great. First couple or rows YOU WILL be soaked, next couple splashed. You won't leave dry unless you sit towards the back. Lights, Camera, Action show was good and Shrek 4-D Adventure was a surprise! Great family fun!

Anyways, the park and the shows were good. The best show was a Waterworld one featuring great stunts and special effects. The food was terrible, expensive and barely edible, eg a $8.50 pizza that was the size of a piece of toast and had one slice of ham on top. Definately eat outside or bring some food. Also bring plenty of water, it gets hot standing in all those queues. The rides were great if you were happy to wait a ridiculous amount of time - the Transformers ride had a wait time of 140 minutes, the Battlestar Galactic rides had wait times of 90 and 125 minutes, etc. I've been to theme parks all over the world and never seen such ridiculous queues - the park operators here are greedy with the number of people they allow in.

However, when we reached USS around 11am there were huge crowds already. We thought it would be less busy on a Monday, but it wasn’t.Lining up for tickets took around 45 minutes, only suggestion here is to buy online to avoid waiting in the heat and humidity.When we got in, most rides had a 60 – 80 minute wait time. If you’re into your rides I suggest you pay the additional cost to get the Express Pass. As I went with my parents, we decided not to go ahead with this as my parents weren’t intending to go on many rides.I really enjoyed my first experience with USS, this time round I did not enjoy it so much.

It is way too crowded and u might have to wait for 1-2 rides for the better rides. The pass will cost you an additional whooping 50 sgd but if u cant stand long queues then go for it.Try to aim at doing the main and most enjoyable rides first. Dont get distracted by the photographic moments and head straight for the rides. The best rides are :1.Transformers (u cant miss this, best ride ever)2. Revenge of the mummy3. Battlestar Galactica4. Jurrasic Park5. Lights camera action (ultimate sound studio experience, do visit)Others are okay okay and should be done only if u get any time left.

Basically Singapore has put a status on people ""if you have money than you can skip all the lines"" . Just like bribery. I'm waiting in line with my two children for 50min on rapid adventure...while other people that can spend the double amount of money can skip all the rest of us. I will have to check if the Americans do the same in their parks. I had to skip three rides because the wait was over an hour , the galactica, and one next to it , and transformers. The mummy ride was thrilling , which seems no one has commented about this . It was scary , high speed roller coaster in the dark. I recommend all to see this fantastic show ""waterworld"" adapted from the movie . Big applause to the actors with their amazing stunt !!! original and entertaining . big Wow!

All I can say is......never again!When you arrive you are met with a huge queue to buy the tickets. Whilst in the queue you will be bombarded with offers for discounts but only if you are a Singaporean or a resident.It cost S$75 per adult and children aged over 12 pay the same as adults. So for a family of 4 the cost was an eye popping S$279 or £130. It could be argued the same as a U.S or European experience.Once in the problems really start. We arrived at 10am as the park opened and waited 15-20 minutes to get tickets. Having done so we headed in and being familiar with the park, headed for one of the main attractions. The wait was 2 hours! We passed on this and moved on only to find the delays on the next attraction exceeded 90 minutes. The queuing was not helped by the failure of one of the rides and so we moved on. 1 hour after we had entered the park , we had not gotten on a single ride!. On average the waiting times were 90 minutes! In the end, and fearing we would not get on anything, we purchased 4 express passes which allowed one time access on a priority basis. This cost a further S$200. With express passes in hand we headed for the first ride only to be told that the priority line wait was 25 minutes! This went on all day and major attractions never had waiting times less than an hour.What made all these queues even more irritating was that the ride often lasted less than 1 minute. In one case it was just 55 seconds.The waterworld show was a highlight but ruined by people -sitting in seats clearly marked as splash and soak zones - using umbrellas. Not action was taken. Indeed umbrellas and selfie sticks were a constant issues and were widely used with little or no concern for anyone else. You can understand why the are increasingly being banned.Food was simply appalling and hugely overpriced. We tried to order a family pizza and asked for two toppings which was brusquely refused so we left he park to find something better. Not only was it better but substantially cheaper and no more than 200 meters from the entrance.The level of English was very poor which is surprising given the high quality of education in Singapore.We left just after 7pm when the queues were still in excess of 1 hour for the main attractions and we felt drained, in part due to the heat but also drained financially by a S$500 day out, that simply disappointed from start to finish. There are many better ways to spend S$500/£250 and a day out at U.S is not one of them.Given the numbers of Chinese tourist in the park I suspect that U.S.S does not need to worry about 4 Europeans who will never go back. But perhaps they should!

review_304900332,“Don't know what to express😮”,"There's too much to say.Though the waiting time was soooo long, the game rides worth queuing. Besides, some people bought the express stuff which enabled them to jump the queue, that was really frustrating. Thanks for their good work(this is a sarcasm), they ruined your trip and your attitude towards the games.The Transformer 3D movie was GREAT. You can't predict the plot of the movie and the movement of the 'car'. These made the game become hair-raising! The Puss in Boots rollar coaster was also amazing! It was not that scary but it would definitely surprise you. It is suitable for persons of all ages. The Shrek 4D movie was attractive. You cannot stop laughing and the donkey was SOOOOOO funny.The show, Donkey Live, that donkey was very cute and you will probably fall in love with it. You will burst out laughing and have a great fun with the lively donkey.The show, When you Grow Up, which is presented by Sesame Street, Elmo was EXTREMELY ADORABLEEEEE! I fell in love with it after I'd watched the show. It was meaningful and it will recall your childhood with Sesame Street.I was quite disappointed with the Treasure Hunters in the theme Egypt. . It was not scary at all! I queued up for almost an hour but it didn't worth anything! It was so boring and I wanna sleep.The Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure was quite good. You will be scared in the tunnel. However, the slope was too short for you to scream. And the journey was too short and not that scary, actually.It will take decades for me to type here. Just go there and seek out.

review_304875422,“Fantastic ”,"Second visit, this time I go with my family.Battlestar and Galactica is the most favorite. But without universal express ticket you will spend 60-90 minutes in the queue line. SGD50 extra for universal express ticket.Some attractions like transformers, they have a ""single rider"" entry. Choose this so you will cut the line to play the attraction. They will put you together in the group so the number will even.Parade only available on Sunday, which is disappointed. I always avoid to go to place like this in weekend so that means I will never see the parade. I think they should have parade everyday just like Disneyland.

review_304870874,“get the express pass”,"We didn't get to the park until noon and so made an executive decision to get the express pass, which on this day meant that we paid double what the ordinary entrance fee was but it was totally worth it. We saved more than half the time queuing for rides! Note that the outdoor rides close if the weather bureau issues a lightning warning to the surrounding area. The park was not too big and was easily covered in 6-7 hours on an express pass.

Only 1 big roller coaster, but the simulator rides are all good fun with lots of thrills. Max queuing time was for Transformers which was max at 90 mins when we were there. Towards the end of the day the queues were shorter and we were able to do some of them twice. Food and drink overpriced, but as it was very hot it's a good idea to take your own drinks to stay hydrated, unless your willing to pay the prices.

review_304785794,“Quite an expensive park to entertain young children”,"Being a Msian where our currency today has tanked against many currencies including Spore Dollars, visiting USS I would say is a pretty expensive park to entertain young children and old folks. I had with me a 4 and 5 year old boys and senior citizens and all of us are not brave souls to conquer any adventurous rides that has any loop a loop or too many spins. Hence we ended up with the Madagascar rides, Sesame Street Rides and Shrek 3 D movies which we all really enjoy. The Spore heat and humidity was tough to keep the spirits high for too long ... By mid afternoon the 2 boys were exhausted by the heat. We spend more money buying toys and souvenirs. I think it's a good park probably for teenagers, older kids & young adults but not kids too young as you will end up spending more money buying toys! Buy your tickets online to avoid queue. You can show your online ticket from your phone to enter .. So don't waste time collecting your e-tix at the counter! Wear light and comfortable clothing a to beat the heat. Go early to avoid queue but if you can go for all rides, express ticket is recommended to beat the queue in the heat!

Everything is relative to other experiences you have had but what is great here is the park is big. The rides long, thought the Madagascar ride would never end it was so long. In contrast, the Puss in Boots ride was short. We had to leave early because we were in transit but we got to see the Waterworld show which was funny and well done. Drinks and food prices reasonable and well prepared. We will definitely be going back next long transit stop to see more. Highly recommended. The park leaves places like Movie World on the Gold Coast for dead. Sorry guys.

So it was bit tough decision to leave our tour operator for a day and visit this amazing Park. We took a chance and enjoyed our best day during our vacation.

review_304560811,“Enjoyed my day there! ”,"I went there with a group of friends on 2 days, Thursday and Friday. It was packed with people and we had to wait 1-2 hours for most rides. The most famous ones being the battle star galactica and the transformers ride. Do remember to bring your sunglasses and apply sunblock before going there. You'll surely be baking and sizzling under the hot sun! The main highlight of the theme park that I enjoyed the most is the battlestar galactica human and cylon. Tried the human on Thursday and cylon on Friday. Was about the chicken out when I was at the platform on cylon but I definitely did not regret riding it! Gave me a floaty and weightless feeling for a few hours after that. You'll definitely be high on adrenaline! Will go back there again!

review_304559137,“Good day out but pricey $$”,"We spent a full day at universal on a Thursday. We bought the express pass unlimited ($50)and it was the best buy . The waits at the usual lines would have really made the day uncomfortable with the crowds and heat. The cost of food was IMO expensive and a lot more than at comparable parks such at universal Florida , Disneyland etc . The constant drain on your money is a turn off. The rides were well received by my kids and they did multiple rides during the day. We arrived at 9.30am and the park was easy to manage until about 12pm then it got busy and very hot ! If you can afford it buy the express pass . We purchased from Asia travel and it was slightly cheaper. The taxi rank at the end of the day was also long and was in fact the longest line we faced all day.Overall - good Clean park and easy to get around .

There are some exiting or terrifying rides at the park and some tame ones too. As is often the case there can be long queues for the best rides. We enjoyed the 4D movie, Jurassic Park water ride, Madagascar ride and the enchanted dragon roller coaster as well as the Water world and special effects show. The park is clean and tidy with good toilet and eating facilities. You can also refill your water bottle which is important on the hot and humid days. There are some dance shows at Hollywood and stores in each section. Good fun for the whole family.

review_303974745,“Small but worth a visit!”,"I booked on a Tuesday hoping the crowds wouldn't be huge. Still busy but I purchased the single express pass for an extra $50 which allowed me to bypass the queues once per attraction. At first I was a bit nervous whether I had overpaid as I managed to get the Mummy ride to myself a couple of times but about midday the queues started to get longer, peaking about 2 pm with 75 min wait times for most of the rides. As for the overall quality of the park, the level of detail was excellent, with the different themes being easily distinguished as you walked through each zone (the Egyptian area being my favourite with the towering statues). I visited Universal Studios in LA a couple of years ago so in comparison this one is quite good. While it's smaller than its American counterparts, it makes up for it with variety. The Battlestar Galactica twin roller-coaster is particularly good and I do recommend you purchase an express pass as the wait times can get frustrating ( I used up my Rollercoaster express pass and queued up with everyone else for an hour, pay an additional $20 and you can get an unlimited express pass). Overall a really enjoyable day out and I would definitely return!

review_303910378,“An amazing experience!”,"USS at Sentosa is truly an amazing experience and I guess the best themepark in Southeast Asia. However, since the pricetag is really steep, here are some tips to maximize your experience. Mind you, I visited USS with my family on a Saturday since we wanted to catch the fireworks display by the lakeside at 8 pm. First, get there early - atleast by 9.30. Then you can get better photo opportunities with the revolving globe infront of USS before the crowd sets in. If you get there by 9.30 the ticketing lines will not be too long and you can get tickets within 5 mins, but its always better to get the tickets online beforehand so you can have a hassle free entry. If you have an online ticket, they just scan the ticket on your mobile or print. On our day, the gates opened at about 9.45 so we had our first ride before their official opening time of 10 am.The transformers ride is truly amazing and a ride never experienced before. We literally ran to that ride as soon as we entered and managed to ride it within 15min. If your late, you've missed the bus as there would be a whopping que and then it may become tiresome.Other rollercoasters were excellent. We enjoyed both the human and cylon battlestar galactica rides. The cylon is more gruesome, so if your prone to motion sickness, keep it as the last ride. Other rides were also awesome. Come with a raincoat/extra set of clothes if going on the Jurassic park rapids ride as you will most certainly get wet. The show at Waterworld is also good, so be sure to catch it.We had lunch at the Discovery food court. They had Singapore cuisine there and the portions were generous, albeit a bit pricey. Other than that, there are food stalls, kiosks and restaurants througout the park, so you can enjoy whatever cuisine that is at your liking. To cut down on your costs at USS (not only for those who are on a Budget, but also for those to maximize the fun for every dollar spent) search on the internet before buying tickets to find out discounts. Checkout RWS promotions page for any discounts/bundled offers. Also some travel agents offer discounted tickets (We bought tickets at Klook.com for 63 sg dollars), but beware of scams that sell used tickets. Bring along snacks and a water bottle so you do not have to buy overpriced (and unhealthy) snacks inside USS. Use the Sentosa boardwalk to get into Sentosa - its free admission till Dec 2015 due to SG50 and USS is just a few meters from the entry point.In my opinion, the express pass is not useful. It will only allow you to skip the que in a few rides, and if you come early, you'll get to ride all of them with a wait time under 15-30 mins. As the crowd sets in, you might experience longer wait times, but during 12 noon to around 3 pm, you can eat, enjoy the various stage shows, street entertainment, character meet and photo opportunities there and complete the remaining rides towards the afternoon when the crowd is dissipating. Getting there by 9.30, were were able to do almost all the rides atleast once (barring the sheepish kiddies rides of course), the rollercoasters twice, and enjoy most of the stage shows and street entertainment making a two day themepark visit into one.

These popular rides tend to have really long queues. Go as early as possible or go for popular rides in the evening when line shortens else you may have to wait up to 2 hours (we visited on a Monday). Jurassic Park Rapids was good too and don't bother purchasing a raincoat. Get the universal express pass if u can afford it or go as a single rider for those that offers it so you save time.

The longest wait we had for any ride was the Cylon ride which was about 45 mins even with the express pass . Most of the rides were pretty tame , ok but not amazing . The simulator transformer ride was fun and did not have much of a queue . Overall we were dissappointed the park did not have more shows and street performances , it is a rather pale shadow of the bigger parks in the USA . That said , we had a very enjoyable day . One tip I would give is not to buy your ticket in advance , we could have got a 10% discount by showing a map we were given by our hotel . The ticket offices open an hour before the park opens ( 10am ) so easy to buy when you are there .

The queue at the park entrance at the first hour was unbelievable (I think it was more than 40 minute wait time just to enter the park). The holders of an express pass have a different queue line and the entrance is instant. And the same goes for all the attractions inside. There were queues with waiting time longer than 2 hours but with the express pass we didn't wait for more than 25 minutes on the busiest rides.Another negative is the employees English level. Some attractions have an introduction and it was hard for us to understand what was going on. Also, don't expect the same level of entertainment from the employees as in the Disney parks. They are just doing their job, without any extras.If you have the Express pass, half a day would be sufficient for this park for two adults.

I have tried the Battlestar Galactica express and it was an extremely intense. I feel like I'm going to die. (Hahaha) However, it's definitely worth to try. You should try it as well.

Pure fun without worrying about uncomfortable bumps now (or flying out of the seat). Best new addition would have to be the ""transformer"" - way too cool.I would recommend the express pass if you have only a day as the queues are LONG during weekends. The indoor roller coaster is usually deserted once the sun sets. So save this for last if you can.Food is bad (eat out if you can) but water is free (bring your own bottle or buy one there).

You should go early to VIVO City and take the train which costs $4 per person.The express pass allows you to skip the queue once for every ride.Rides not to missTransformersBoth the batalstar galacticaThe mummyJurassic park water rideHaving the express pass and arriving early you can potentially cover the entire park.

review_303464901,“Very Disappointing”,"A real disappointment. Took forever to get there, line up for cable car was huge. Then had to wait for bus to get there on Sentosa. The line to get in went forever. When we finally got in all rides had at least a 60 minute waiting time some 90 minutes. We were there for the day and went on 2 rides. The actual place looked fantastic, and I'm sure the rides were all good, but way to many people. You can buy an express ticket for $20 more, on top of your expensive entrance fee, but the lines were 30 minutes for them. All up, a very expensive day, a lot of travelling around and lining up for not much. We went on a weekday, non school holidays, can't imagine what the weekends would be like.

review_303255246,“VIP Tour is the ONLY way to enjoy Universal Singapore”,"My family and I only had a day to see the park, we were told to check out the VIP Tour. Yes its expensive, but worth every single $. Our fantastic tour guide Mr. Hairin was our personal tour guide, bouncer, butler and personal concierge. He created a bespoke tour of the park for us; allowing us to jump to the front of every single ride. Within 1 hour we had completed over 4 rides. Those without the gracious services of Mr. Hairin had an average wait of 60-90 mins per ride. He was even able to get us a table for lunch at the very busy diner. It is clear the Universal Singapore have trained all their tour guides to very high standards, similar to many high-end hotels around Singapore, however I must extend my complements to Mr. Hairin who exceeded our expectations and made our visit to Universal an truly amazing experience.

All the rides are fun and very well made, especially the Transformers, makes you feel like you're part of the movie. The food shops here don't taste and look good. I suggest you bring something as the food here is very expensive and for a very small amount. Just bring an empty bottle for your water, water stations are everywhere. The express pass makes your life easier for riding the rides that you want as it will only take 20 minutes maximum for the waiting time. Must wear rubber shoes for a good walking experience and wear a light clothing. spent the whole day in the themed park and it was all worth it. I strongly suggest this place!

review_302745107,“The worse experience in Universal Studio”,"I have been visiting several Universal Studio in the World but I really guess the worse one is in Singapore. The reason is the service. Yes the service.... I am so used to have those smiles from anyone where the job is to entertain the customers. In Singapore the Universal Studio Team just forgot whatever they learnt from the U.S.They just don't care about customers, forget to smile, forget to thank. A super rude team without any kind of education. I line at Fossil Fuels and there is 3 counters to take care about customers but only one was opened and the reason from Ms Wan the manager on duty..... We take a break.... Of course the staff are only senior (cheap personal cost in their P&L). At the end at several location in the entertainment park we request for help but I am still waiting some kind message. No ""hello"", ""how can I help you"", ""please enjoy, have a nice day""...... Hospitality behavior is a dream. You will find enclosed a short video to confirm you my bad experiences here in Universal Studios. Paul

review_302727475,“Nice but make sure big rides are open...”,"Been to this location several times. Unfortunately been very unlucky with the major rides being down; I’m not able to use them. It’s a relatively small theme park so one or two rides down has a big impact on the activities you can do, but also pushes then the other customers to the rides that are live, and hence putting more pressure on them. Very easy to get to, very well-organized, and there’s quite a bit to do outside of the Universal Resort. It’s Universal Studios standards so very high quality inside. And some great rides for the children which they loved. So I recommend it, just need to make sure that the big rides are running.

You wont need the express pass and you should beat most of the heat. The food and shopping is good but the restaurants outside the gate offer better food and value for money.

review_302702792,“Fast Path Tickets worth the Extra Cost”,"Took the family and spent the additional money to purchase the fast track tickets for the rides. It was an additional $70 (Singapore) on top of each entry fee. Initially was concerned about the cost but when you are waiting about 15 minutes or less for most rides and the standard wait is about 2hrs it was money well spent. We managed to get on all the rides with the kids going on the popular rides up to 4 times. We found that purchasing tickets on line was helpful and again avoided waiting in line to purchase the tickets at the park. It was a worthwhile experience mainly because we did not have to wait extended periods of time to get on the rides.

You should go as early as possible since the queue can be quite long. We reached there around 9am & there are a lot of people queuing already even though it is Thursday. Once you're inside you should directly go to the popular rides eg Transformers the Ride, Battlestar Galactica, Revenge of the Mummy Ride etc. Since we went there quite early, it only took us 15-30mins for each ride. After you tried the rides then you can stroll around to take pictures. It can be quite hot in the afternoon but there are a lot of bench where you can sit for a while before you continue. The park is big so it can be tiring for older people. Maybe you can rest inside the restaurant there since there are many options . Will definitely go here again next time and tried all the rides.

I suggest that they make the calendar (in the website) more visible, or ask for the date of the booking during Step 2 (to avoid confusion).The goodIt was an honest mistake on our part in booking the wrong date, but they amended our tickets and we were able to enter. USS is a small park, but that makes it easier for us to roam around and explore. Since we're from the Philippines, the climate doesn't bother us that much. For those who aren't used to this climate, I suggest wearing clothing made of light fabric, caps and umbrellas, and an extra shirt. Go here early, and be sure to ride the Transformers first, then The Revenge of The Mummy. The bestWe waited in line for The Transformers for about an hour and a half. When it was finally our turn, the ride stopped halfway and we were driven back. It was experiencing technical problems, we understood that the ride was unsafe at the time being, and that they needed to make some tests. We were disappointed at first, as we were almost done with the ride. However, they advised us to go to guest services to rectify the situation. Upon speaking to the staff, they gave us Express passes (you don't have to queue) as compensation. I commend USS for this type of service, despite the inconvenience, it makes us want to come back for more.

review_302512384,“Express pass a MUST!”,"Family of 4 (50, 24, 21, 13) visited on a Friday. We managed to get on all the attractions we were aiming for and then some (15 out of 21). The park is definitely much smaller than the others, and food choices are not great...but a theme park is still a theme park: loads of fun for everyone!Some tips:- Get there early to grab some breakfast and to purchase your express tickets. We got there by 9.15; park gates open at 10.- DEFINITELY get the express pass! We were wondering if we'd made a mistake getting the pass as the queues for the morning were very short (5 mins waiting time), but the crowd started pouring in in the afternoon and there was no way we would have managed to get on all the other rides otherwise.There are two kinds of express tickets: Universal Express ($50) and Universal Express Unlimited ($70). The normal one allows entry once for EACH ride, while the unlimited one can be used as many times for as many rides as you like. The Universal Express is sufficient unless you're planning to go on the same rides over and over again.- Plan ahead! Know what attractions you want to visit and in what order. You can view the map on the USS website. I would recommend starting from the right side of the park and going on the popular attractions (Transformers, Battlestar Galactica, Revenge of the Mummy, Jurassic Park) before it gets too crowded. Also be sure not to miss WaterWorld and Shrek 4-D Adventure!- The Lost World (which is where 5 attractions are located, including Jurassic Park) only opens at 11am, so plan around that.- If you're Malaysian, there's an online promotion going on until the end of the year where you only pay $66 for your tickets (normal price is $74) and it comes with a $5 meal voucher, $5 retail voucher (for purchases over $35) and free all-day parking.ENJOY!

I thought it was boxing day sales for a second. We went on a week day too to try and avoid the queues. We asked about the express pass but the ticket person said to wait until or if the park got busy. We got on the first three rides no wait. Jurassic park was around 30 minutes as the express passes were being let through which is fair as they paid straight away. By the time we realized to see the whole park you needed the express pass it was too late in the day. The park was great overall we really enjoyed it but you need to get the express pass when the park opens no matter what anyone tells you as it can go up in price throughout the day.The rides are a bit tamer than other big parks but the mummy Rollercoaster, transformers and cylon were really awesome. Make sure you get on those early. Also the park doesn't die down so don't count on waiting for everyone to go home to get on the rides. Get the pass.

review_302288915,“A *Big* Day”,"We were there from opening at 10 until closing at 7, with two young children which makes for a big day - but we needed the time to get to everything. The big controversy with this park is the queues and the express pass concept. I'm not going to say whether to get the pass or not - but I will say that each ride has a pretty accurate sign at the start of each queue indicating how long the wait is. At the start of the day we saw this around 5-10 minutes, and by lunch many rides were up to 100+ minutes. In our experience, we needed the express pass to get to everything, and while it hurts to pay extra on top of the admission price it would have hurt more to have missed as many rides as we would have had we not had the pass.Hot tip for parents with young kids - look into the ""Child Swap"" policy as well which may help you manage times when one or more of your children are too small for a ride and you don't want to queue more than once to manage the kids. Recommended rides? Don't miss Transformers. Incredible immersive 4D experience which *really* had my senses confused. Other than that there are many good rides, but transformers is the standout.

The fun will worth the troubles if you follow some advices:1. If you can travel there off peak tou should. If you can book your visit to Universal Studios to an off peak day also, you MUST!2. Buy your ticket online at klook.com. It's way cheaper.3. If you have money it's worth to buy the express pass that allows you to skip queues. I didn't and I could manage, but if I had another opportunity, and money, I would bought it (20—50 SD).4. Plan your time there. There's a lot to do and not enough time, and a lot of people trying to do the same! So look in the website all the rides, and attractions and go for your favorites. You won't be able to do everything in one day. Stick to your favorites or go again another day.5. Be smart in what to wear, it's a park with crazy rollercoasters and lot of queues, in a VERY HOT country. Light clothes, flip flops, sunscreen, hair up and no acessories (you don't want be tangled in the rides, do you?). Don't try to be super pretty, go for comfort and stamina to survive the day!6. Prepare to spend 10 SD with lockers. Some rides they don't allow you to enter with your mobile. You will be obligated to rent a locker.7. If you need to save money bring a snack for lunch time. The food there it's crazy expensive. 5. Get there early, be sure to be there around 8:30—9:00 (the US opens at 10).8. Don't follow the people. Once those gates are open and you are inside, run for the rides! Don't waste time with pictures, looking around and souveniers, you will have time for that later. Trust me, go for the rides! I suggest you that order:I. Battlestar Galactica;II. Transformers;III. Mummy;IV. Jurassic Park.If you take just the main attractions of each, you will be finished around 1pm. 8. Have a nice lunch, sit down, enjoy the view and the air of the park. This just for you catch your breath after running from ride to ride, and standing forever in queues again.9. Look in your attractions map the time of characters and park main attractions. Make sure of:a) Don't miss the Waterworld!!!!!b) Don't miss the Steven Spielberg Special Effects!!!!!c) Have at least one picture with famous characters;d) Take some selfies and enjoy yourself!10. Once you have diggested your lunch (not doin' nothing, but doin' light stuffs like taking pictures, or goin' for really light rides, or watching the main atrractions) go back for the rides that you haven't done or want to go again. Just make sure you are managing your time wisely, remember that there's a lot of interesting things going on in the park besides the rides.

review_302036977,“A Must See Attraction in Singapore”,"We spent a whole day in USS. It was a great experience. You need to plan well to utilize most of your time and not miss out on the key attractions. My suggestion would be to first focus on the core rides in every section as early as possible in the day because it gets crowded as the day progresses. You can also opt for an express pass (at added cost) which has separate queues and helps you reduce your wait time. Food choices are not so great.

review_302031581,"“Small, Pricey, Long Queue (unless you have an Express Pass), faulty lockers”","This is a relatively small park, compared to the one in US and Osaka. I have been there 2 times, once with the Express Pass, once without it. With Express Pass - our family of 4 completed 70% of the attractions within 4.5 hoursWithout Express Pass - we managed to complete ONLY 3 rides, within 4.5 hours!!!The Express Pass is very expensive, but if you really want to enjoy the attractions without the long queue, it is better to pay the $$. Being a tropical country, Singapore frequently experiences rain shower. When there is thunder or lightning, the outdoor attractions / rides would be temporarily suspended. This means you might have queued up for up to 60 min. for nothing! Do take note of this ""risk"" when you visit the park. This is also another reason why it is better to buy the Express Pass. There are lockers for rent, to store your bags. Some rides (e.g. the mummy ride) do not allow visitors to carry any bags at all. The first 45 min. of rental for the lockers is free, but subsequently, you need to pay quite a hefty fee for their usage. One problem I find is - these lockers do not work very well at all. A lot of visitors had problem operating the rather un-user friendly and often faulty ""locker allocation vending machines"". When trying to secure a locker to deposit our bag, the allocated locker door would not open, so we had to go back and queue for another locker. When trying to retrieve our belongings from the locker, we realised that we have exceeded the free period and had to pay S$3. We only managed to deposit S$2, and had to cancel the transaction because we realised we didn't have enough change. But when we cancelled the transaction, the machine 'ate"" our money, instead of returning the S$2 to us. We then borrowed S$10 from another visitor and tried to open the locker door, this time the machine ate the money, without opening the door! We had to seek for help from the locker staff in the vicinity. Needless to say, the locker staff were EXTREMELY busy trouble-shooting the various issues visitors had with the lockers. We wasted precious time, just to retrieve our belongings from our locker.

review_301834084,“Spent most of the day in queues”,"This place looks impressive when you first step in it and clearly a lot of money has been spent on its construction but it was a poor value day out. We spent about 8 hours at the venue, at least 6 of which were spent standing in long queues for the rides. The wait for decent ones was over an hour and even people who had bought express passes for extra still had to wait 15-30 mins. For a family of 2 adults and 2 children, it really wasn't worth the time, effort or cost especially since it was a hot and humid day.

The pass is equivalant to a ticket bought at entrance so just buy it that is a money-griefing way. Tip: Buy ur ticket at Taobao (China) or online u get cheaper tickets than at the ticketing office, and if u are lucky ur ticket are also with a meal coupon and also pass.

review_301832629,“Vacation”,"Went there on a vacation as it is one of the places to visit when in Singapore. The attractions were all worth seeing. You get what you pay for when you are inside and you must be prepared to take on all the rides and attractions inside. When in USS one must spend one whole day to try all rides and attractions and to see roving acts like mascots and acts. You must fall in line though but that is understandable since this is a theme park full with people. If you do not want to fall in line you can purchase an express pass for a fee. Food is everywhere inside the park but a bit pricey though still reasonable. Don't forget to get souvenirs from your favorite shop and pictures.

The service upon arrival a little slow but once we had our passes we were on our way. With 2 teenage kids they loved the whole experience. As it was a very warm day, was a bonus that we didn't have to wait in line for any of the rides and shows. We managed to see the entire Studio and had time to go back and do extra rides without waiting in line. Our private host Jimmy was fantastic and an asset to Universal Studio.

review_301696691,“Small Universal - But Fun”,"We went on a weekday. We enjoyed it quite a lot, although it is a small Universal, I think it's the smallest in the world. And it doesn't have Harry Potter ride :(. We have some tips for you....The morning is the most crowded time. We wanted to go early to avoid lines, it's the opposite - lines are much longer in the morning. We noticed that by 4 or 5pm, the lines got a lot shorter. So if you do not want to watch every single show (some of them are only a few times a day), then you can easily go at 4pm and go on all the rides within 3 hours. That's on a weekday. And no need fast pass. That'll save you money. We went in early, there were so many people, so we bought a fast pass in a shop (easy to do anytime). Frankly, we wasted our money)For the rides, the best is definitely Spiderman. If you like roller coasters (we are not big fans), then Battlestar Galactica is open again (the aliens side looks more scary). For a lesser roller coaster you shold go on the Mummy - it's like Disney's Space Mountain but better. The Puss n Boots ride is terrible. The Shrek 4D movie is fun, as is the Shrek castle which houses it.

review_301691845,"“fun wether its play, shopping, dining or just photo ops!”","We went there on a weekday to avoid the long lines. But am glad there are advisories everywhere to choose which ride takes a short time. As well as the shows. For the shows, the USS store has a schedule of what is in store everyday. We bought the ticket fr changi recommends in the airport as well as the gardens by the bay and sea adventure, much cheaper. And you don't have to visit both on the same day as other offers that I see. There are also other options and travel agency who offers cheaper tickets too.Grab a map and go!We always looked at the advisories and line in to the least waiting time, those are the rides we took first to be finished in time for the shows- we made it in time for the donkey show and the waterworld! Well my kids doesn't want to get wet so we seated ourselves in the safe zone. Others are ready, they have raincoats with them. I missed the Jurassic adventure since they don't want to get wet, as well as the cyclone, since nobody wants to ride with me.Rides are safe, they really ensure everybody follows their safety procedures. Canopy flyer is fun(kinder compared to cyclone), puss in boots giant journey, don't miss out shrek's 4d adventure(line is always short) and around 2pm, we were surprised the transformers the ride had a 10 minute waiting time! Great ride! The waiting time for the ride is lesser in the late pm, so don't go along with the am influx of tourist.There are a lot of dining options to choose from, a bit pricey by s$10, I think... Turkey legs at s$12... Fruit cups s$6... For water, its either you bring a bottle or buy one inside, refill is free, coz there are a lot of drinking fountain to be found. Use MasterCard in shopping, they have 10% discounts! Clean park, they have lots to offer, the one i love most - no smoking! Yes I would go there again even if its pricey and ride the other rides I missed- it's fun! Don't miss it!

Place is well managed with lots of local and global food options (I prefer to eat local when in a new country). All in all must visit place. Even a full day is sometimes not enough. Tip: be prepared to walk a lot and wear equatorial clothing, it gets blistering hot in the Sun.One suggestion for Universal: you need to create more places with shade for people to rest.

The transformers ride was awesome by the way. but expect a lot of patience for waiting in line. It may take you from 30-45 mins before you can ride this thing. but it's all worth it. other attraction like mummy, we weren't able to ride. the line already at the entrance door.it's enjoyable for both children and adults.

We bought the tickets online a few days before and this saved so much time as we collected the tickets by the sentosa monorail. We HIGHLY recommend you do this as the queues are crazy outside the theme park! We walked straight through into the park and we were not disappointed. It was raining most of the day but most rides were still open. We bought universal express passes for S$50 each and this was a life saver. The normal queues were up to 2 hours each and this saved lots of time. Overall, the park itself is clean, the staff are friendly and it is a definite must visit!

Annoyingly, the first attraction we felt like we waisted a lot of precious time was made for 5 years olds (Spagetti story). After that, we decided to purchase the priority pass for additional 70 dollars/pp. Was it worth?We managed all rides but to be honest, for adults, there were unfortunately only 3 decent attractions (Transformers 3D Battle-fricking cool and new to us!!! and the HUMAN and CYLON roller coasters) everyone wanted to go to. Even with the priority pass, we waited up to 15 mins to get on. The other attractions and shows (Ancient Egypt, Lost World or Far Far Away) were pretty ridicilous unless you are visiting the park with small children. Overall, too expensive for what you get - we have been to other amusement parks that were cheaper and offer a larger variety of rides for adults.

review_301342388,“Too much time spent on queueing”,"I went early when the parked open and most of the rides had a ridiculous waiting time (+ 1.5 hours in some).The park is ok but it's really small compared to USA one in Orlando. If you have been to Universal studios Orlando I advice to skip this park since its features the same games but with a high amount of waiting . If this is your first time to Universal studios then this should be worth it.Some of the things which I found strange in this park- Very rude staff as other reviewers have mentioned. I saw some scream at other guests in the park. clearly lack of management.- Metal detectors before playing thrill rides!!! why!! you will see queue before riding some of the thrill rides just for security before able to queue.- I bought the express pass and we barely able to finish the main rides (was very expensive compared to universal USA). I waited in some of the rides 40 minutes even with an express pass. What bothered me most is staff are letting people queue in the express lane even without having an express pass. When they reach the end and they need to show their express pass to the ride operator they will get turned back from the start and queue in the normal queue (waste of their time!!!).Overall, good park for first timers to Universal studios and not that fun if you have visited Universal studios in the USA.

Get here at opening to get ahead of the queues, and if you want the ""thrilling"" rides purchase the express pass, without that some of waits were up to 90 minutes I saw. I won't pick a favorite ride as all were great for all age groups. Clean and the food is not too pricey. Only issue I had was people constantly blocking up walkways taking their stupid ""selfie"" photos without thinking of others.

Sure to have the time of your life with all the rides, attractions, themes, games, shopping, collectibles, photo clicking, food, frolic and fun here. The best part of this locale is that there is an experience for everyone - kids, teens, adults - from one to all. Transformers, to Mummy, Jurassic Park, Shrek, Halloween Horror, Puss In Boots - the list doesn't end. What's more is that the other super exciting concepts are a stone's throw distance away from Universal so that one can spend a whole day (or even 2 days) of zeal and zest at the Resort Worlds Sentosa. There is waiting for getting your most favorite rides, but then that can be managed with just a tad bit of patience, isn't it! A little spending on getting a whole day general ride pass may get you there faster. Must to do - a classic photo on the foot of the studios next to the Universal globe - you can and should feel the Hollywood mist on your face..

It's also near a Resorts World casino if you want to gamble after the rides. Inside the park, there are several themes like Jurassic Park, Shrek, Transformers, Elmo, The Mummy etc. There are rides for the young and old. Their thrill rides did not disappoint such as the Cyclone and it's twin coaster. The mummy ride is not to be missed! Get ready to get wet with the Jurassic Park ride, bring or buy a raincoat before riding, or better yet, bring extra clothes. The Movie Studio theater is also an interesting attraction since you will see a soundstage like attraction and how they do the effects of a scene with a category 5 hurricane. The park is well kept, with lots of food stalls and restaurants inside but price is a bit steep. It can get hot during the summer, so wear light clothing and bring shades and a hat, wear your sunscreen too! Character mascots walk the park streets ready for a quick picture. Don't miss Universal Studios when travelling with kids. It's a great way tk bond with the family!

We paid our entry ( which at $74 per adult, wasn't too bad considering) and joined the queue. It moved pretty fast once the park opened. We got inside and headed for the first ride. We joined the line ride and after about an hour managed to enjoy a couple of minutes of excitement. This pattern continued twice more then we had some lunch. We started again after the food . Long story short. This place is phenomenal. The rides are fantastic if you can stand in line for up to 2 hours. I recommend you purchase the Universal Express pass and just jump to the front of the queue. Max wait time about 25 minutes. Food around the park is a mix of asian and western and all is reasonably priced, considering. There is a very large amount of things to do and see so maybe plan a vist over two days.

We arrived at the park entry queues at 10:10am.Our day had about two downpours of rain, which made for a hot and muggy adventure.We pre-purchased our tickets to enter the park and still had to queue for 20 minutes. I think they could have opened more entry gates as there were 3 exit gates with the mark having been only open for 10 minutes.The queues were long for most rides, with a good 2 hours spent queuing for the Transformers ride. 1 hour for Puss In Boots and 1.5 to 2 hours for Battlestar Galactica. Other rides averaged 30mins. I also feel line the staff aren't happy with their jobs. Not many were smiling when we visited, and when you've a long wait, you need as much joy as possible around you. The fans used to cool you while you queue are inadequate, and often filled with dust which wouldn't help their performance.Food within the park is expensive (which is to be expected), and luckily our tickets came $5 Discount Vouchers for use at good vendors within the park, so our 4 vouchers saved us a combined $20 off the family pizza we ordered. The pizza was OK, nothing to write home about taste wise, but it hit the spot.If I did USS again (which I won't), I would look to get the VIP Pass so that we could make use if the shorter wait times, but even then I am not sure I would happily pay the extra money.As adults, the Transformer ride is the most enjoyable ride we did, and out kids enjoyed the Sesame Street ride.My recommendation is if you're seeking a good day out at a theme park, go to Hong Kong! The staff are happier and you feel happier as a result. The wait times for the rides is much less, and the place just feels like you got value for money after spending a full day there!

review_300225946,“A must do when your at Sentosa Island ”,"A large amusement park that has everything you really need and expect from a typical Universal Studio layout. The cost of entry will vary as other tour agencies will combine other places of interest around it as packages. In which we decided to do with Viator tours. We purchased the voucher online which gave us a day pass through Universal and the S.E.A aquarium. I believe that looking online will be your best bet to safe money and get value out of your money. We saw that the cost of entry to Universal was about $74 for an adult ticket, where the S.E.A aquarium admission cost about $24-30. There is plenty to see, which has great photo opportunities. Although it offers plenty of rides and attractions, it was very busy and we highly recommend that you purchase your tickets before hand. Or you will be waiting in along queue for the purchase of entry and then again waiting in line to just get in to the park. We only went on a handful of rides. As the lines of the popular rides were way too packed to even bother to wait in. The best way to fully experience this beautiful park and its rides is to purchase an express ticket that will get you through the lines quicker than others.Overall it's a really good place to head to especially with the family. It was my partner's first amusement park experience and she had a great time.

review_300158389,"“Expensive , Long queues”","All main rides now open. You need to go early and get express pass to enjoy the rides. One day passes very expensive , only really good value if there are deals running, or you are in the market for a season or annual pass. On the main 3 rides (Transformers , Cylon and Human) unless early or late in day currently expect waits sometimes of above 2 hours (standard tickets) and most annoyingly sometimes 20-30 minutes for express passes. This indicates simply too many express passes being issued.Food expensive , but can go offsite and come back to park if you want.Rides are good and shows excellent ..don't miss them (Shrek and the lost world). However park too busy , too costly and too many delays for us.

review_300144888,“Go there 10min before park opening!”,"I am a Singaporean and I'm just going around writing reviews on Singapore attractions to help tourists. I loved U.S.S, especially the Transformers: The Ride and the Accelerator. Transformers: The Ride is a 4 Dimension ride which is awesome. At the last part, you will find yourself Falling off a building in a battle. So cool! For the Accelerator, It's like those spinning teacups I find in some theme parks, and it's not so fast. However, do mind that if you have those kind of dizziness whatevers (I seriously forgot the name!), I recommend you not to ride it. My classmate got so dizzy that she vomited. I recommend you to go there 10 minutes before it opens(Which is 9.50am) and stand at the front waiting (That's actually a very Singaporean way). In the afternoons it is really crowded so I really recommend those sleepy ones to wake up early if they want to go to U.S.S. No offence :)

review_299845381,“Long lines due to frequent stoppage of attractions”,"Waited 3 hours for the 10 mins Transformer ride. Reason ""due to technical error, the ride is suspended. You may join the line but we're unsure when it will resume"" That 3 hrs line was possible after 4/5 of the crowd left. Water fountains water pressure is disappointing. Was it for drinking or washing my fingers only. Almost 1 of the 2 fountains found are choked with water over flowing. The rides safety checks are a waste of human resources. You have a few staff standing around, yet only 1 is checking every outgoing ride AND the enterance + exits are secured. Oui, every of this takes another 5 mins and the queue are slowed down because of this. For goodness sake, if you are collecting so much $$$$$ for the attractions, for goodness sake, ensure the rides & facilities are properly maintained. Highly unlikely to return.For those who wants to be tortured. At vivo city or the Seah Im Road hawker, have a big meal and buy your drinks & snacks there. Local & supermarket prices. In the attraction, prices are beyond day light robbery (e.g a simple hot dog bun = >$8.80!!!) !!!

review_299724836,“Day out with kids”,"We really enjoyed ourselves with the different rides. I think they have rides suitable for young ones all the way till about 14-15. After that, the older kids may find these too tame (except may for Battlestar Galactica).We finally found the courage to try out Human (but no Cylon) and my 10-year old daughter was initially quite apprehensive but loved it so much we went for a second round. I know the Unlimited Express pass is very expensive, and I paid $100 per person to add to the 6-month pass. But if you are short of time, this is the way to go. I didn't want to spend $100 at first, and queued for 40mins at Transformer before deciding to give up (it was another 20mins to the front). We then spent 15mins queuing for Madagascar but noticing that those with express pass took 5 mins. It was then that I decided to buy the Express pass. We then had a breeze through the queues, which were rarely more than 10-15mins with the pass.Yes, I know, very expensive for a family of 4

It a beautifully designed parc, albeit cramped on a relatively small piece of land. The attractions are a lot of fun, especially the rollercoasters. We were there on a friday, with local school holidays finished. The first few hours were still ok, but then it got crowded. Even with the express pass (which is not cheap), it was a long wait sometimes. Without the pass the rollercoaster line was a whopping 2 and a half hour wait!

review_299359387,"“TOURISTS, NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO SAVE!!!!”","Much has been written about the park so you know it will be fun. There are about 10 major rides. Transformers, the roller coasters plus the stunt show and Shreck 4D top most folk's lists. They are lots of fun. Most rides provide air conditioned breaks from the Singapore heat; but not all. Assuming you spent big bucks to get to Singapore, now is NOT the time to start saving. BUY THE FRONT OF THE LINE PASS! Even on slower days you will be glad you did as you glide by the line. The pass will let you get thru the attractions before your 'Theme Park tolerator' runs out (or you divorce your family). The food inside the park is basically awful, unless your idea of haut cusine is a turkey leg. Water breaks will set you back $20 so skip the meal in the park, get the 'front of the line pass' and get thru the park before you get really hungry. Then you can eat outside the gates where you'll save enough on food to pay for that 'front of the line pass'.

review_298880336,“A super day out”,"This is very much a ""mini"" Universal Studios in comparison to its bigger brothers in Orlando and California. Nevertheless, the magic of being in a ""super park"" remains, yet the whole experience can be easily completed within a day. This, combined with the very reasonable ticket prices, make it an essential visit for anyone who enjoys theme parks.Attraction queues are within acceptable limits and careful planning will ensure you never need to wait long EG. Transformers gets very busy in the morning as everybody heads to it (this is Asia after all), but can be walked straight on to later if you are willing to wait until near closing time. A couple of important points to note, however:- Singapore is a tropical climate and there is rarely a day when you will not need to carry both sun-cream/hats/sunglasses AND a raincoat. Be prepared for all seasons weather- This a much more rollercoaster heavy themepark than other Universal Studios. If you don't enjoy them at all (even family ones), then it's simple - don't visit. Also keep in mind that due to frequent thunderstorms in the area, many if not all of the rollercoasters (and select other attractions) will close when there is a risk of lightning. This happens frequently but is only temporary.Best rides include Revenge of the Mummy, Battlestar Galatica and Transformers.Well worth a visit if you enjoy themeparks and are in Singapore. Spare two days if you want to spend more time on Sentosa Island, which is highly recommended.

It was raining when we arrived so we headed straight to Lost World for the Jurassic Park Ride.We only queued about 30minutes and it was great.Expect your feet to get soaked and when it came down the big ramp at the end there was only 2 that got soaked in our boat(so pot luck where you are sitting!)We managed most rides and the longest we queued was for a 2nd time in the Transformer 3D ride which ended up being an hour.The Mummy Returns is also a great ride and we only queued 20minutes for this one.I think the rain maybe had put people off coming.The Park is lovely and clean and is all things American!We ate at Mels Diner and the burgers were delicious.It's about $14 dollars for a meal with fries & drink.There are more rides aimed at younger folk but for the price and a great day out I would reccomend it.We enjoyed it and over the whole day only walked 5 miles according to my pedometer on my phone.I wouldn't like to go when the Park is at full capacity but we picked a great day.

Kids aged 10&6 had a tough time in the queues but managed to keep them awake and occupied. Had to put large backpacks in lockers which are available for rent when you go on some of the roller coaster rides (non-refundable SGD5 for 135 mins).

review_298135760,“Wonderful Time Guaranteed”,"Yep, no joke that this theme park has the cleanliest nominated one as I heard.They are also organized and well maintained. Try to book the tickets online to avoid the long queue to enter the park. And do arrive as soon as the park opens (10ish), or get your breakfast there (9ish) so you could enter the park earlier before the park actually opens for public.Do try all the rides if possible. Waiting time for Revenge of the Mummy, Cylon and Human, Jurassic Park and Madagascar are the longest. Hence, do manage your time well. Waiting time could be up to 1,5 hours!However, for Revenge of the Mummy & Cylon - Human rides, you queue inside the building. So you won't feel it that much.Please don't forget to place your valuables and carried bags or lose items inside the locker they provide just next to these 2 rides. Otherwise, you are forced to go back to the locker place just to put your (for example:mobile phone) and you may lose your place at the queue as many people would take your place in the line again (that means longer queue for you!)Do purchase souvenirs after the rides if you find something you like. Don't wait till later as the shops close exactly at 6 pm (except for the big shop near the entrance door).

The parade (held on weekends) was short but sweet (have been to disney and those parades are much bigger). There are free lockers (time limited) so you can store loose items for some of the big rides.

review_297836790,“Take plenty of money with you because you will need it!”,"We made a “flying visit’ to Universal Studios during a hectic one day stopover in Singapore. Fortunately we gained free admission to the attraction due to passes provided to us by our airline as part of our stopover package. If we did not have that have those passes, we would have been facing substantial admission charges and it just would not have made good financial sense, to pay that large amount for what was really a very short visit. During our brief visit, it became quite obvious that for the unwary, there were extras to pay for at every turn. From “must have” professional photographs to food, drinks, novelties and souvenirs, there were many, many opportunities for the individual and families to be relieved of their “hard earned” cash.On the plus side, there were many rides, shows and sidewalk attractions to keep people occupied enjoyably for much of the day. If you are thrilled by “death defying” thrill rides or entertained by Hollywood characters and American gloss then Universal Studios is a must do for you whilst in Singapore. However, if you do decide to visit, you must ensure that you are prepared to spend plenty of money.

review_297825114,“Overall a good experience but beware the food - 2.5 stars actually”,"We went to USS with friends on 10th Aug 2015. We were 3 adults and 3 kids aged 4, 6 and 7 years with varying levels of exposure to and interest in theme parks. Luckily all the rides were open and we managed to cover everything we had in mind. IN SHORT: PROS: Rides are good and the place is really well done up and thought through. I don’t think it is for serious thrill seekers as many rides were seriously tame. I am frankly quite averse to roller coasters and avoided the Mummy Returns, Human & Cyclone but found everything else very doable and non-scary. So I guess this is a relatively mild theme park.CONS: I’m docking stars for DIRTY WASHROOMS and HIDEOUS FOOD as well as for MISREPRESENTING PRICING on their website (express pass is just 30SGD, [yeah right] we paid 70SGD per person including the kids). DETAILS: FOOD: We sat out the Enchanted Airways ride as my 7 yr old was v anxious after his first roller coaster ride on Puss in Boots Giant Journey. Decided to use the time the friends were taking to do this ride to get some food. Bad decision. The closest place was ‘Friar’s’ and since it was packed, we thought it looked like a good option. We got 2 chicken fillets with fries, water, orange juice and Sprite (for 1 adult and 1 child) for SGD 30. The food was inedible. CARRION MEAT REGURGITATED BY A VULTURE WOULD PROBABLY TASTE BETTER. There was a gross slimy greyish layer between the breading and the chicken that made us spit it out. We ended up throwing the entire chicken away and picking at the fries which were awful too. My child filled his tummy with orange juice. He was so put off that he refused to even consider another restaurant and wanted to only eat at something we have tried before (we only reached Starbucks at 6pm so that didn’t work out). We finally settled for some really eggy choco chip cookies from a vendor that were at least palatable. I think USS needs to check their restaurants and inspect food quality and taste. This has to be the most horrific meal I have ever had and that includes a competitive set of some very fishy clams I ate on Pattaya beach and shampoo flavoured lentil soup eaten on a ship ride to Goa. As someone well-travelled I can typically pick a decent food option even if only fast food is on offer but this was beyond anything I have experienced. Paying 30 SGD for it didn’t make my mood any better. AVOID at all costs, in fact can I suggest packing food, or heading outside the park or to the Hollywood section at lunchtime as the restaurants there looked better. They do need to shut this place down but first, make the staff eat their own food. RIDES: MADAGASCAR: Very tame slow boat ride through a Madagascar setting. Suitable for young children. Not particularly scary or entertaining but the kids liked it and if they like the movie and enjoy the characters they will be quite thrilled. SHREK 4D: Nice-ish, appreciate that the water wasn’t freezing cold unlike some other 4D experiences. Didn’t like the waiting period where they set the context with a pretty boring dungeon show. In fact some people left thinking that was all there was to the show. Once inside it was entertaining esp the spiders . MAGIC POTION SPIN: Tiny ferris wheel outside the Shrek 4D theatre. Nothing to write home about. PUSS IN BOOTS GIANT JOURNEY: A sort of starter roller coaster ride, with some twists and speed but very manageable. Plus you are in a car type thing so you feel very secure. However do avoid this for kids who aren’t very fond of roller coasters. This was my 7 yr olds first ever roller coaster ride and he didn’t like it much. To be fair, the park provides ample warnings and the map shows what to expect so you can avoid anything you might find too scary. ENCHANTED AIRWAYS: I missed this one as my kid wasn’t keen after the previous ride.CANOPY FLYER: Waiting time was an hour for express pass too so we avoided this. DINO-SOARIN: Simple ride where you can push a button to gain height. Good for young kids. Only thing is that its open air with no shade and can get very hot and sunny. JURASSIC PARK RAPIDS ADVENTURE: Okayish. The boat ride itself if alright not super thrilling or superfast with an ok drop at the end. The thing is that the dinosaurs on the sides aren’t even faintly scary, even for a child. And why are they spraying water? Anyway there is a part of the ride in the dark with strobe lights that my kid again hated and so this with the Puss-In-Boots ride, were his least favoured rides of the day. You will get wet so do take a locker (its 4 SGD an hour) and place everything including your watch, phone, shoes and socks in there. We put in our bags but I wore my watch and both of us had our shoes on. We got wet and its unpleasant squishing around later. TREASURE HUNTERS: Really slow baby jeep ride through an abandoned excavation site with skeletons and scarabs. Not scary at all and the jeep barely picks up the pace even if you stand on the accelerator. On the plus side, it really helped my kid get over the previous ride . ACCELERATOR: Spin the saucer meets bumper cars type ride. Short and not hugely thrilling but the kids liked it. TRANSFORMERS 3D BATTLE: Awesome – a must do. Honestly it’s almost too real. We all loved it. LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION: Interesting and well done effects. SESAME STREET SPAGHETTI SPACE CHASE: Very sweet baby ride for kids. They really loved it. FAVORITES: Me: Transformers 4D. Kids: 4 year old – Sesame St Spaghetti Space Chase6 year old – Puss in Boots & Sesame St Spaghetti Space Chase7 year old – Transformers 3D battle & Sesame St Spaghetti Space ChaseSHOPS: All in all the merchandise, displays and stores were really cool. Since we came with 3 boys we spent most of our time and money in the Transformers Supply Vault. Cool merchandise and affordable. WOULD I GO BACK? All in all I wouldn’t visit again as I thought it was poor value and I will not forget that awful meal in this lifetime. Literally put a bad taste in my mouth. TIP: Buy express passes online where they are cheaper / fixed price. Do not go with the normal ticket unless you plan to spend the entire day in queue. Yes it is expensive but your experience will be ruined if you go with the entrance ticket only as really the queues for the express lines were also 30 mins or more.

review_297488033,"“Nice Place, but below our expectation !”","We went to Universal Studios with lots of expectations and perhaps was a bit disappointed with this on the whole. My kids enjoyed some of the attractions. Even on a week day we had to endure long queues in most of the attractions with waiting time of 45-75 minutes. One suggestion for people looking for adventure rides is to start from your right side when you enter, by this you would cover the Transformers, Cyclone and Mummy attractions. Unless you take an express ticket, you would end up wasting most of your time in long queues. We were perhaps a bit unlucky, with a slight rain in sight all the open rides would be stopped. We lost about 1.5 hrs in this. Steven Spielberg Movie experience is something one must not miss out. The Shriek 4D experience was a disappointment too, compared to our experience at Sentosa a couple of days ago. They don't allow outside food and food facilities inside is pathetic. We had to stand at the Egypt cluster for around 1 hour to get our turn. Long queues, inadequate staff and just one payment counter.Never visit this place on a weekend or public holiday.

review_297388169,“Not living up to the hype!”,"A good outing for you and your family provided the right conditions being present! Namely less crowd and proper weather. Its not that big compared with few other theme parks i have been to but the variety of rides is such that every age group can enjoy. From awesome roller coaster to good shows like Shrek, Lights Camera Action, etc. If budget is not a constraint would strongly recommend an express pass. We went on a week day and still were faced with waiting time of more than a hour for majority of the rides. Staff manning the rides were very friendly and helpful. I did not enjoy my visit mainly on account of following reasons:1) As mentioned above long lines for many of the attractions2) Rides closed arbitrarily on account of "" Technical issues"" / Bad Weather"". Considering that it rains majority of the days in Singapore you can't just shut the operations. For close to 2 hours many of the rides were closed! People wait in queue for 90 min and when its their turn rides are closed! If they can't convert it into a dome like structure then they should compensate given the high entry charges!!3) Food!! Too expensive even by Singapore standards and worst part is quality is not up to expectation. We had to wait in line for nearly 40 min for our turn. No one to manage the queue, speed up delivery, clear tables!

review_297123128,“Absolutely ridiculous”,"Obviously made for the asian market is is very small indeed. We turned up for the kids and i must say it was an expensive waste of a trip every ride had a que of about an hour or so at least. For example we went in line for the adventure rapids at jurassic park and we waited around 2 hours with about 1 line left before our turn the ride manager decides to turn the ride off because of so called ""severe weather conditions"" we then waited another hour hoping it would re-open but it didnt in which case we decided to leave considering it opens at 10am and closes at 7pm we spent 3 hours for. Ride we couldnt go on. The worse thing was that the weather looked absolutely fine the sun was out in full scope. Disappointed we left and decided to visit other rides which were all closed for the same reason hence leaving us with not many choices. Exhausted after waiting for nothing we decided to get some lunch in which there were ques about 30-45mins long i mean if you need water for someone thats dehydrated you can consider that person dead. Anyways as we were all hungry we decided to wait and get some lunch hoping the so called ""severe weather conditions"" would disappear after we finished eating. After finishing we thought we go find something open and having seen all the rides functioning again we thought we might as well go to the rock climb. And once again we were told it is closed this time without reasoning having been disappointed we decided to pay customer services a visit they themselves didnt know why the rock climb was closed she rang then to find out and apparently it was because the rocks were wet. I mean considering how much you pay to enter and the amount if rides you can actually visit in a day it is totally not worth it. Their open for 9 hours a day and 90% is waiting in ques the rides that you manage to get on last around 2 mins after hour or so waits its atrocious. Wouldnt recommend it to anyone. Only positive is that the universal studios store for children is relatively cheap compared to our disney stores in the uk you can pick up large plush toys for £15 max so not that bad tbh.

Perfect, pleasant weather for a day at Universal Thankfully, all rides were open despite the rains. We took an express pass and walked royally into all the rides without waiting at all. Recommend this if you want to want to go on every single ride, cos the lines in the regular queues are serpentine, and you may not have time to go on all if you're stuck waiting there.Human and cylon were by far my favourites. Mummy is awesome. Transformers is so much fun! Go go go!!Lots of restaurants. Loved the concepts used in every one of them.The minions store was super-cute.

review_296921223,“Great day but extremely crowded”,"We visited during the school holidays - unfortunately, because even though we went there on a Monday, it was extremely crowded, and the lines for the top attractions were almost two hours. We chose to buy unlimited express passes, which cost more than the entrance ticket itself, but if the park is packed, like it was on the day we visited, I think it's worth it. The food was okay, but nothing more, and the lines were long. The choices on offer were mainly Asian or fastfood, but most places didn't offer both, which would be nice if not everyone in the family agrees on what food to get... The park itself is actually not very big, I think I had expected more. It doesn't take long to walk through it all. But we had a good time and it's a great place to visit with children - if you beat the queues. The Shrek 4D movie was great, Jurassic Park was a hit. But one day was enough, really.

Each time, USS never fails to disappoint.The best times of all are when we get the Express ticket. With the Express ticket, we managed to get on all the popular rides in a fraction of the time and still join the single queue to do much more.My favourite rides are:1) Return of the Mummy, which is an underground high-speed roller coaster with sharp bends, backwards motion and in-ride photo-taking.2) Jurassic Park, a water rapids ride, where there is elevation and certainty of getting wet.3) Shrek 4D movie, featuring moving seats, leg tickling and water water everywhere!4) Transformers, with lots of action, ""flying"" which feels really realistic and awesome sound effects!Free up a full day for Universal Studios Singapore.

Because of their ages (12 and 8) we didn't go on some of the bigger rollercoasters but we loved the puss in boots and transformers rides(which was worth the admission price alone). The rides in general were all good with kids liking the Madagascar and jurrasic park ones. We also caught most of the shows including waterworld which was probably the most entertaining. The only disappointment was the unthemed food. Were as at Disney the food is mickey mouse shaped at universal you could be at a local food hall. But that's just nit picking. In all it's a great place to spend a day. Also try to catch the Crane Dance on the way home it is quite unique and very enjoyable.

Staff seem to lack training or common sense when it comes to efficiency on the rides. A queue for the Cylon coaster which should have been 30 minutes worth of people ended up being an hour and a half due to the batching attendant not doing his job properly and constantly letting in priority riders without the main queue moving consistently. The whole point of fast track/priority queue is to skip the main queue, but the batching assistant would hold back the main queue whenever there was people in the priority line and fill up trains completely from that line. What he should be doing is batching half and half to ensure both queues move consistently and not treat the main queue like second class citizens!

On advice from other friends, we purchased unlimited express passes for us all, which was really worth the money. It is hot and humid in Singapore so this cut the waiting times for rides down significantly throughout the day. As an express pass holder, we were able to join the shorter queue into the park (on the left hand side) AND cut the queues. My daughter loves all rides and was able to ride around 25 rides in 1 day due to our express passes. As adults, we did not have to waste much time at all waiting for her as most of the time, she was free after 10 minutes. At lunchtime, the queue for the most popular ride was 2 3/4 hours long - the express line was 1 hour long!The park is great and handles large crowds well. It wasn't easy to find healthy lunches but we didn't really mind for the 1 day. Don't bother lining up for the ""Donkey"" show as this is an animated show - not live. The Madagascar Crate adventure is a cute ride, similar to ""It's a small world"" in Disneyland.Definitely worth a visit if you are a ""rider"".

There were many shops with merchandise from the movies, the most sold were the goods about the minions. The restaurants inside go from traditional Chinese cousine to the American diner.

review_295844220,“Great day out full of fun and entertainment! ”,"Make sure you get to the park early around 9:30am so you can get a good spot in the que and get in as soon as the park opens. I recommend hiring a locker as soon as you enter as you can't have anything on you on certain rides. There are lockers located on the right hand side as you enter next to the gift shops that you can hire all day for $10 and re open as much as you want. After you have your locker make sure you go straight to the rides to beat the ques and take photos later during lunch time when the rides are really busy. If you go on a Saturday i recommend purchasing the unlimited express pass for $70 it is valid all day on all rides and definitely pays off, some big attractions such as transforms and battle star galactica que times ranged from 60 minutes to 140 minutes for most of the day! With the express you would either get on straight away or wait 20 minutes at most.So make sure you take photos and look at the gift shops during lunch time when the rides are the busiest.

review_295724772,“Doesn't uphold the Universal name.”,"Visited on my own on 3/8/15 and was sorely disappointed with Universal in Singapore. I have been to both the Florida and Los Angeles Universals, both of which far exceed this one.The day didn't start well when I arrived at 10am (opening time) only to find that there was only one ticket booth open for a queue stretching a mile long. That's right - three servers for a massive queue. After waiting 40 minutes I eventually got my ticket and then had to wait AGAIN just to get into the park as there were only three turnstiles open. How ridiculous.It was raining so I wandered over to Far Far Away and ducked into the Shrek 4D film to shelter from the rain. At that point the queue wasn't long so that was quite enjoyable. I then headed over to Jurassic Park to go on the Rapids but apparently there was ""lightning"" (there wasn't) so it was closed. Another disappointment.It was half past 11 by this point so I decided to get lunch and beat the crowds. Next disappointment - the toilets in the Jurassic Park area by the food court were dirty and several were out of order. In fact, throughout the day as I visited different toilets I noticed that most of them were not being kept clean and tidy. Towards the end of the day, one had a mountain of used paper towels exploding out of the bin which had clearly not been emptied all day. Anyway, I had no complaints about my bowl of laksa - very nice.First good thing I can say - as a solo traveller I had an advantage over everyone else because a few of the rides, such as the Revenge of the Mummy, had Single Rider queues which allowed me to jump straight on. However, had I been with a group I would have had to queue for several hours for every ride. A severe waste of time considering there are only about three decent rides in the whole park.As it was, I had to queue for two hours for the Battlestar Galactica ride, with not even my phone to entertain me because everything has to be left in a locker. Very dull for a solo traveller because you don't even have anyone to talk to! I can imagine that this is what everyone else had to go through for every single ride...TL;DR - only a few good rides (Transformers, Mummy, Battlestar and, I assume, Jurassic Park), queues are massive and the park is dirty and miserable. Don't waste your time - if you can afford it, go to the far superior one in Florida (I spent five days returning there again and again last year; it was amazing).

However one thing I need to mention is that in terms of crowd organization, Disney Parks are far better. On a summer day, you are unlikely able to do popular rides for less than 90-120 minute wait, unless you pay extra for the priority pass.

review_295542960,“worth a day”,"great day out for the kids. having visited California, it is not in the same league or on the same scale which has advantages and disadvantages. it is not ridiculously expensive. park closes at 7 which seems quite early. if you get in early and to the front of the queue you could probably tick off the popular rides early. understandably the quality varies. some parts were absolutely up to US standards, some not. One thing I love in the theme parks in US is the random barbershop quartet and top class musical/dance performance which seem to come from nowhere. they try but do not quite hit the mark. it was not as slick as US theme parks but had a very nice feel to it. it was easy to get around and not quite as chaotic. There are probably 4 must do rides and most the rest you can tick off in a more relaxed way. kids had a great time.

review_295255762,"“A day of fun, thrill and laughter”","A day well spent at Universal Studios - Singapore. We went on a weekday and still found the place crowded inside. Luckily there was no waiting queue for the tickets at the time we reached at around 12.30 noon, however to avoid the queues we had already purchase the tickets online. Look out for online deals / discounts on their website.It opens at 10 am, reach as early as possible inorder to cover all the exciting rides as some of the rides have a long waiting time / queues due to fast track entry (costs extra) and in general it gets crowded. Wear comfortable shoes as the queuing up at the rides do take a toll on your feet. Carry water and light snacks. Food court areas are generally overcrowded, a lunch meal in a food court will cost you about 11 SGD. Otherwise, there are also many cafes and restaurants inside.During our visit, it was raining on and off and hence the rides had to be closed till the rains stopped. This led to a lot of wastage of time hence we were not able to do the exciting rapids adventure and The Treasure hunt (this ride didn't seem so exciting and the waiting time was also long).Thoroughly enjoyed The Revenge of the mummy's , it has quiet a few thrilling jerks and turns. The Transformers had a long queue however it was moving at a good pace. 4D Shrek was fun as well. Puss in the boots and canopy flyer were exciting, it was like a very short roller coaster ride but with medium twists and turns. Puss in the boots queue took a lot of time due to fast track entry queue. Lights camera action was a good experience. Madagascar crate adventure was a fun boat ride with no risk of getting work.Some of the rides have locker facility for storage as they don't allow you to carry the bags on the ride like the mummy's and rapids. The locker at the rapids ride was paid from the time you queue up itself and there is an additional cost for buying a poncho.The rides closes at 7 pm. However, if you are in the queue for before 7 pm they will take you on the ride. Lots of dining options just outside the studios also. After an exciting day at universals, we then boarded the free Sentosa shuttle bus from the convention centre area. We spent the evening at sentosa dining and watching the breath taking fireworks at the beach. There were budget dinner options (10 SGD for a meal) along with he expensive ones. On the way back to the city we took the free sentosa express to Vivo city mall and then boarded the metro back to the city. Vivo city has good food and shopping options.

review_294849193,“Must visit - Avoid weekends”,"Latest addition to Singapore's tour destination. Absolutely wonderful experience for young & old. The entire park has been done up well. The popular rides take about 60 to 120 minutes, hence unless you are full of energy you would end up taking max 3-4 rides. The highlight of the park is of course the Transformers ride, took us 2 hrs in queue but was worth the wait. You are made to feel that you are part of the movie action, wearing the 3D glasses you feel like being right in the center of all the action.Those with motion sickness must avoid the ride.Do not miss this one. Another popular ride is the Battlestar Galactica roller coaster, was thrilling and worth the 90 minute queue time. Revenge of The Mummy was the surprise of the day, didnt expect much but was WOW a high speed ride in complete dark with effects to thrill - do not miss this one. Finally took the Madagascar ride was extremely boring can be avoided. The entire park is full of energy, would love to visit again.

review_294572701,“amazing experience!”,"we went on a weekday hoping for less crowd but there was soo many people!. so we had wait hours for some rides. if you go early then you have less waiting times on ques. my advise is start early 1st go all the rides then start exploring the park. we book via viator the Singapore Super Saver offer: which allows admission to Universal Studios, S.E.A. Aquarium and Maritime Experiential Museum Admission with Hotel Pickup for only USD 72.44. it was a great advantage because we didn't have to wait in ques for tickets and also i heard the in some days there is a risk of running out tickets. only downfall was we couldn't get the hotel pickup because we were unable to contact the given number on time. nevertheless its very easy to get to senthosa island. you have to take the MRT and go to harbor front station and go up in the building to vivocity to get the sentosa express. there are signs everywhere so you can't miss. entry to island is $4. since we went to universal studio we got down from waterfront station that is the 1st station. in the park i recommend Jurassic park (since i love those movies), mummy returns( u get a very scary ride in the dark which simulate to be inside a pyramid), and transformers where u get to save the all spark after fighting with decepticons. also in scifi sector u get to see old Hollywood, sesame street, fast and furious, and many more. there are some events also happening in this area where we got to a amazing dance from group of boys and also a photo opportunity, had a photo taken with Marylin Monroe, saw a performance by sesame street characters. there is a little building in near cookie master cookie cart called ""light camera action"".lot of people dont go in there thinking its something small so there are less Queue time. but inside was an amazing experience where u got to see how they use special movie effects to create a hurricane in a small harbor with heavy winds, fire, and thunder. its a must see! altogether great experience. go early, 1st go to rides of you prefer 1st and then explore other area to get the maximum benefits. also i recommend to get the express ticket so you don't have to wait in long lines. we didnt get them and i still regret that! i have still lot to cover and hoping to visit again.

So it was an expensive day.We added up we spent 3 hrs of the day in queues, even after buying the fast track tickets, so be warned they don't really work. The queues to place food orders were also inexcusable at over 30 mins - just to buy a hot meal!! The food outlets are severely understaffed, and poorly organised with staff not operating to full potential. Get your act together Universal, you're charging premium prices for rubbish performance, especially at peak meal times.Aside from that, the few rides we did experience were very good, namely Gallactica, Ancient Ruins, Roller coaster (red). Many we couldn't get to with hr long wits for express ticket holders.And Mels diner, you should start selling milkshakes, as your outside neon sign suggest.

review_294310080,“Buy an express ticket!”,"My 3 friends and I spent a day here during our trip to Singapore and we had a great day. I have been to the Universal Studios in Orlando, and whilst this park is clearly not as good and is a fraction of the size we still had a thoroughly enjoyable day and I would visit again! The park entrance ticket is very reasonably priced, costing around £35. Unfortunately we were unaware of the existence of the Express Tickets (fast track) which allow you to skip a large part of the queues. A lot of the queues were extremely long and tedious, made even more frustrating by the disproportionate manner in which people from the express queue were let on rides (read 75% express queue, 25% standard queue per turn). As such we were unable to go on some of the rides which was disappointing.The food inside the park is also overpriced, as to be expected in a theme park. Just outside the park there are lots of places to eat, so I would recommend leaving the park and returning after eating if you are looking to save some cash.The best rides of the day were the battlestar galactica (blue track) and the mummy ride.The park was not very busy at the start of the day so I would recommend getting there for when the park opens, buying an express ticket (but perhaps saving the use of it until the crowds arrive later in the day!)

review_294286205,“Can be great at a cost . . .”,"We are very frequently in Singapore, and usually do not do any touristy things because of the weather (too hot and humid to enjoy being outside too long). After a few years of my daughter wanting to visit Universal Studios and me telling her, no, too hot, we'll go to the one back home (since we live in California), but not making it down to SoCal when we were back in the states, we decided, okay, let's just do it! So here is my advice to those of you who want to do it too:1. Buy tickets beforehand online. Even if you can't get your SIA boarding privilege discount, just do it. (In the big scheme of things, it's piddly savings.) Having your tickets will save you the grueling wait (so close but so far way!!) at the ticket booth. (Alternatively, you can get to ticket booth early, which opens 1 hour before the park opens. Another option is that there are many travel agencies/etc in town and even some sellers in the carpark below by the coach bays that will see you tickets, sometimes discounted, though don't think they offer the express pass, see #2)2. BUY THE EXRESS PASS, this is SO key! You should just figure this into the cost of the ticket if you want a good experience. The park was open 10 am to 7 pm the day we were there. What seems like a reasonable amount of time becomes nine short hours when some rides have a 2 hour wait!! This Express Pass is not cheap. If you are a RWS Invites member (loyalty program, of which a visitor will not be), Express pass pricing starts at $30, if not (all of us visitors), $50. The basic $50 allows you one express entry to each ride. Express unlimited allows multiple entries, but costs $20 more, at $70. However, they have dynamic pricing in effect, so if too many people opt to buy the express pass, the price increases. (That's another reason why you want to buy beforehand/early.) The day we were there, we got to the ticket booth at about 11:15, and the cost of an unlimited express pass was $90, ouch! But on rides where the wait in the regular line was over 2 hours long, the express line was 30 to 45 minutes. On many rides with a regular wait time of 40 to 60 minutes, the express line was 10 to 15 minutes, and on several essentially no wait at all in the express line. If you do not want to spend your entire day waiting in long lines, you will need to pony up for the express pass. (They check both at the entrance of the line as well as just before boarding, we saw people who snuck into the express line and got rejected at the end for not having an express pass.)3. Choose your day wisely. Thunderstorms are always a possibility here but some days are worse than others. Rides CLOSE DOWN when there is danger of lightning. Can't suck anymore if this happens after you've been in line over an hour!4. On choosing days, we thought our non holiday Thursday was a good day but it was crazy crowded, so don't know if there are any less crowded ""good days."" Don't want to think what the weekend days would be like. 5. Both Battlestar Galactica roller coasters allow nothing in your pockets, no cell phones, no coins, nothing. (They run a metal detector over you at the entrance.) Both BG rides and the Mummy ride do not allow any bags/backpacks, but they do have (cool fingerprint scan) lockers nearby. The day we were there and times we used, first 55 minutes were free at the Mummy ride, first 3 hours free at the BG rides, but maybe this is based on dynamic pricing too because earlier in the day, it did not look like the lockers outside the BG rides were free. 6. Hydrate! Yes, it was hot, exactly why we've delayed. If you bring a water bottle, you can refill at the water fountains in the ride lines, or you can buy $3 sodas or $5 slushes.So overall, we had a good time because we were able to go on all the rides we wanted to in the short amount of time we were in the park, but it was expensive and not something we'll be doing again anytime soon if ever . . .

review_294260264,“USS - Universal Studio ”,"It is safer to buy tickets from the USS website than from other travel agents or online sites as there were cases of fake tickets being sold. The Resort World Sentosa (RWS) which operates USS and other theme parks on Sentosa island, offers special promotion on tickets and it is worthwhile to check their website. I managed to get 3 adult tickets for S$68 that included a combo meal coupon (S$12 value) to be redeemed at any food outlet within USS. This offer ends on 31 July. There are no existing promotion for child ticket. This translated to significant savings for a family of 4.It is better to have an early morning start to enjoy the day at USS. Getting there was easy and convenient especially if you have an EZ-link card which can use to pay fares on all Singapore buses and MRT. It can also be used to pay for the $4 fare for Sentosa Express, from Vivocity to the USS stop. The card will save you some time queuing and buying tickets for the Sentosa Express. The EZ-link card can also be used to pay charges for lockers at each ride in USS. Ensure that your EZ-card has sufficient value to last the day. We were there early before 10 am when USS opens but there was already a huge crowd queuing to enter. We decided to do the popular rides first - the BattleStar Galactica - both Human and Cylon rides. We didn't have to wait in queue for long as we were early and could even do the Cylon ride twice but had to wait about 1 hr 45 mins in line for the Human ride. If you have insufficient cash to pay the locker fees, seek out a friendly staff who will pay for you to open your locker to retrieve your wallet to repay him. Getting an express ticket to be in the express queue is one way to beat the long queuing time but it can be costly for a family of 4. But the queue provided an excellent opportunity to interact with the kids whose mobile devices are stowaway in the lockers too. The long queue time also means that it will not be possible to cover the entire USS in a single day without rushing from point to point, and without the express pass. However, there are no 2-day passes for USS. The little one (10 yrs old) felt nauseous while queuing for the Human ride and it was good that we were prepared with ziplock bags.Some of the other rides not to be missed are the Revenge of zone Mummy and Transformer. The Shrek 4D show is highly enjoyable and so it is the water world show. Do not miss them. Check the show times, and do take note that the outdoor shows and rides can be temporary suspended due to lightning risk. Do not sit in the blue and green benches if you don't want to get wet while watching the Water world show. You will get wet for the Jurassic Park: Rapid Adventure even if you have a poncho. You can save some money and skip getting one. A change of clothes or a towel came in handy to dry off after the ride. The children enjoyed Shrek, Water World show, rapid adventure and mummy rides the most.Great outing for the family.

review_294240899,“Just not worth it”,"Pros:Visually amazing, really well done.Cons:2 hour wait for rides.Hot, hot, hot.Massive crowds in cafes.This was my second visit in two years and confirmed my previous doubts about the place.The waiting times for the rides are just ridiculess and it's really hot when standing in these lines. When rain comes in, the rides are closed if there is any chance of lightning (this is Singapore and there's a good chance of rain everyday). I completely understand the safety aspect, but if you've been waiting for an hour in a line and the ride is then closed its pretty frustrating.Some public walkways are covered, but not the majority are not. Covering them all would really help with the heat.Just a waste of a day for us really as we could not get to do what we wanted to do.

review_294082959,“Que-up and leave every penny!”,"I did not have many opportunities to visit similar parks before so my experience may be something you encounter at every park these days, yet it was still annoying.Most reviews are ""must see"" and ""truly amazing"". I agree, rides are really good. However, your experience and, hence, the satisfaction level will depend on one very important factor: the express ticket! Pay the additional 30 S$ for it you may be able to visit all the attractions in one day. Even with the pass you may wait up to 50 min. for some more attractive rides! Single rider's que may speed up the waiting times at some rides, but where is the fun in riding without the people you came with?Mortals without the express prepare to wait (a looong time). Rapids 2h10min, Galactica-Cylon 170!!! minutes. They cleverly disguise the ques with walls and long corridors so you get lured thinking the que is not that long. The displays for the waiting times are never correct so you end up waiting longer than expected. From 9 hours I spent in the park, I was waiting about 6. That is not how I imagine fun.Prices in restaurants are unreasonably high for what they offer and 25 S$ per picture that gets taken on the ride is truly incredible. Some rides do not allow any bags or ""loose items"" so you need to rent a locker at 4$ and hour!?Avoid during holidays and weekends!!!

review_294010763,“Fun but long queues”,"Had lots of fun at Universal Studios although the queues were extremely long. I'm not sure if that's just because of the time of year or if its always like that. The roller coasters which we really wanted to go on were 120-150mins queue time most of the day so we didn't end up going on them as I couldn't stand for that long. It didnt even get better at the end of the day so that was disappointing. Some rides are quicker if you go single rider which we did when we could.

review_293999063,“Perfect park - if you accept queuing...”,"First – we visited during Chinese New Year holiday - not the best choice of timing I must admit, and this affects the evaluation.As we were far from alone in the Park, much of the time we spent queuing instead of riding roller coasters. We went with children aged 7, 9 and 12. Something to do for all ages, which is a plus. The castle of Fiona was a thrill for our 7 year old. The boys concentrated on the roller coasters. One of the main roller coasters, one of the largest ones, was under maintenance, a minus when the park was so crowded.Because it was New Year celebration, the park offered a parade, which was very nice to look at. We were lucky and got a good place to see the parade. The park was open until 20.00, and by 18.00, people started to leave the park. That meant less people = less queue. So the last hour the kids run from one attraction to another in the park, having an enjoyable time.Water is sold everywhere – a must during the day. For a park this size and with so many visitors, I expected more toilet facilities, but the ones there was nice and clean.In the evening, we got to see fireworks, that for a Norwegian can be characterized as spectacular!Compared to European parks, this park is more “plastic”, less places to sit down, less trees, flowers and lawns, but I see that the limitation is the space available, so it is understandable. All in all a satisfied and tired family in the evening.Quite expensive to enter. We came to late to get hold of express bands, that would have affected the experience a great deal and the express bands is probably worth the money. If we ever get back and we revisit the park, express bands is a must for us.

review_293950588,“Universal Studio's”,"I had visited Universal Singapore about a year with my Dad about half a year ago, was disappointing then but my wife really wanted to go this time. We went on 27 July 2015. We arrived 40 minutes early and bought express tickets. The official website told us all day express( less time waiting in ques) would be 50 dollars but was 80 dollars. The main ticket was 74 dollars, so we spent 154 dollars each on our tickets, for a total of 308 dollars. We did not have to wait long to try out the Transformers ride which was amazing but very short(5 minutes). Then we went on the Madagascar ride which was very boring and then to the bathrooms near that ride. My wife left her phone in the bathrooms and we found it at lost and found 4 hours later. We spent about 2 hours looking for the phone so by that time all the rides had huge ques. Even with our express passes we had to wait 30 to an hour for each ride. The food selections were overpriced and tasteless. The turkey leg was 12 dollars and was red raw and disgusting this time. People without express tickets had to wait 2-3 hours for each ride and each ride only goes for about 3-5 minutes. The water world show was very over rated and cheesy and people ran to their seats knocking over other people and trampling on them. Universal studio's is the worst one out of them all and the most overpriced, small, and unorganized. Singapore should be ashamed with themselves for such a money grabbing attraction. I have never felt more ripped off in my life. Never again.

review_293603198,"“Good visit, except for the long queues!!”","Visited Universal Studios on a weekday and still came across terrible queues for some of the best rides. Some popular rides have an option of single ride, where u would split from your group but is a very good way to cut out the queue without an Express Pass.. :) For the Transformers Ride specifically it would not make a difference if ur split from your group.We went to the transformers ride first as it is the best experience in the park. We had around 1 hour wait which was a disappointing start. Next we moved to some small rides which had about 10 minutes waiting time like the Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase, Shrek 4D, Lights, Camera, Action! These may not be thrilling rides but they are a good 1 time experience. The Water World act had a large crowd 30mins before start time, and there was no arrangement of shade area!! But, the stunts performed by artistes and their interaction with the crowd was great fun. The Mummy Ride had hardly 15mins wait time. Jurassic Park Rapids was a horrible 180mins waiting time, but went into the line to save ourselves from the terrible heat outside. This was a fun and a pleasant ride. By evening, we visited the Canopy ride, but after a 20mins wait the ride was closed due to technical difficulties. Went to Transformers ride for the 2nd ride from the single rider queue and we had just 5 mins wait compared to the 40 mins wait time for the normal queue. At the middle of the ride, they had technical difficulties again and we were asked to come back later. Managed to catch on the Canopy Flyer ride which seemed like a slower version of Gallatica and was for hardly a minute. Compared to our 1st visit to Universal Studios at USA we were definitely disappointed, but nevertheless we enjoyed all the rides we visited. Just the management should seriously get some action to reduce the long waiting time which seems to overshadow the actual fun time.

However, having paid $330 to get the five of us in we then found rides were experiencing ques of 1-2.5 hours. We were advised to purchase an express ticket which cost another $400. This enabled wait times of 10-20 minutes for some of the younger children's rides but there was still over an hour ques on the Rapids, roller coasters and other top rides. We arrived when park opened at 10am and left when it closed at 7pm and never got on every ride.

The queues were miles long and there was a 100 minute wait for battle star Galactica meaning we didn't go on which was a disappointment to say the least. I have to say the mummy, transformers and Jurassic park rides are three personal favourites of mine but prepare to be soaked on the Jurassic one! Whilst on the transformers ride it stopped but the staff cleared up the repairs quickly and we got another go straight away.

While it's a bit pricy it's worth it if you suffer dehydration like I do, and waiting in long queues in 34 degree heat is not my idea of fun! It wasn't as big as I thought it would be but still enough to make you sleep like a baby that night! The attraction where they show you how movie sets are created is a must!

Recommend to head straight for the Transformer 3D ride since average waiting time on weekdays already need a min 40 mins. We queue at the single rider's lane for shorter waiting time (but you've to be seated separately from friends). Worth the wait, a spectacular ride! Next go for the Puss In Boot - Giant Adventure Ride (roller-coaster) newly launched. Thumb up and short waiting time 15 min. We didn't take the world's tallest Battlestar Galactica ride as it was raining when we are in the queue (approx. 110 min wait time). Oh, the 4D Shrek show is one not to-be-missed. If excludes all the waiting time for rides and having quick bites for lunch, you probably spent less than a day in the theme park. Overall a good trip.

review_293192445,“Universally disappointing ”,"Visited universal a couple of days ago and was really looking forward to it! Sadly it didn't live up to expectations. The park is small, which is fine but as a result there are not so many rides to keep you entertained. This is made worse when it rains with any risk of thunder and lightening as all out door rides close down (for obvious reasons). As a result this causes all park guests onto the indoor rides creating mammoth wait times. The reverse of this can then be expected when (and if) the outdoor rides reopen. The only other option is to eat in one of the food outlets. The only way to really get the best out of this park is to take advantage of the fast track passes or go on a day where you are guaranteed no thunder storms, which in Singapore during the summer will be a challenge! Its somewhere to pass the time with a few good rides but sadly it's nothing to shout about.

review_293158621,“Over-Rated”,"Not at all that great and definitely over-rated considering the 2+ hour wait time at the Transformers Ride and another 2+ hour wait time at the Jurassic Park Rapids. Admittedly, the Transformers Ride was cool and well worth the wait. The other rides were ok. (Most are similar to the Enchanted Kingdom rides in Laguna, Philippines.) I was not able to experience the Mummy Ride and the giant rollercoasters because of the horrible wait times. Maybe it was because of the free Jubilee vouchers provided to the locals and it was a Saturday. I'm not sure except that it was not the best experience. Perhaps, it would have been better if prio #s were given and tourists were allowed to check out other rides while waiting to maximize the use of the theme park. Another thing that would have made it a better experience for us if there were chairs/benches provided for those waiting in line. Even without the super long wait times, I wouldn't recommend spending an entire day at the theme park. Your time is best spent exploring the rest of Sentosa, or the rest of Singapore.

Before i explain the main attractions the problem at this place is long queues and waiting everywhere you go. So there are two line one is express and one is general. General lines normally have waiting upto 1-2 hours in most of the rides and express lines only have 15-20 mins waiting. The system is that you have to purchase express tickets for each or ride you want rides along general entry ticket . The price details are available at the www.rwsentosa.com. Now i will come to the attractions. The first two dont have queues (1) Water World- Its a must visit place which depicts the original scenes with gun fire, smoke, fights from the ""WaterWorld"" movie. There is different show timing mine was 4.30pm and there is no queue as its is a mini auditorium. (2) Far Far Away- You and kids will love this 4D movie and anyone can visit irrespective of age. ( 3) Sci Fi- Transformers ride- No matter how long is the queues dont miss it. This will be like you are actually in the movie. (4) Egypt- The underground ride amazing and scary (5) Madagascar - For kids (6) Jurassic Park rapid adventure - Well i heard its amazing a ride in a river but unfortunately i couldnt made it as the general queue waiting was 2.5 hours.

review_292835743,“Smaller Theme Park - But Still Worth it.”,"This is a smaller park than some I have been to in the USA and only has about 4 roller coasters worth going on. That said it's still a good day out and has lots to do especially for kids and families. Its easy to get to from the Sentosa Express and there are plenty of places to eat etc near and within the park. Best ride is Revenge of the Mummy.

review_292829842,“Great visit...must buy express pass”,"Had a wonderful weekend day out at USS. One thing is for certain...the express pass option is simply indispensable if you want to avoid standing queues stretching up to 3 hours long! Money buys time and nowhere is this more true than in a hot and humid crowded theme park. The rides went above and beyond expectations. The Transformers, Mummy and Battlestar would me my top three picks.

They do a hotel pick-up and straight to the theme park. The kids were always excited and shouting to see the roller coaster and the other ride. Spent almost a day with rides, taking pictures and having meals. The trip to the theme park was really fulfilling.

review_292559424,“Prepare yourself...”,"What I don't like is the waiting time. For the transformer ride, we waited and stand up to the line for almost 2 hours for merely a 3-4 minute ride. But it is all worth it when my nephew and niece enjoyed the ride. And for the other rides, always check the waiting time before you fall in line. It is usually correct or add 10 minutes more... If you are looking for the rides, it is recommended to buy the express but it is much more expensive.

review_292532047,“Fun day - Bit Disappointing”,"The price is pretty expensive considering the size of the park/the rides inside. For that amount in the UK you get a much bigger park with much bigger rides and a larger variety of things to do.Saying that, the atmosphere and just being at universal is still amazing and we had a great day. We ended up buying the ""Express"" passes at £35 each as the Queues where far too long even on a week day with no holidays on. Once we had these the day was much better I would definitely recommend it if you can afford too.The locker system for the rides is really good, no charge unless you go over the time limit.Food is expensive but expected that.The different areas e.g. Far Far Away, Sci Fi, Ancient Egypt... Are really good but each one could do with more rides, pr stalls, or just ""something"" as it feels a little empty and no choice.Lastly, characters only come out for photographs a few times a day and the Queue for them is very big, we went to join the back of the Queue and were told ""no more photos"" ....

Just make sure to avoid public holidays - that's when we have been there and without an express pass (price tag of S$60 p.p.) it's impossible to make it even half way through the park. The ordinary line for the Battlestar Galactica roller coaster was around 3 hours and even with the express pass we waited around 40 min.Make sure not to miss both Battlestar Galactica rides, the Mummy, and Transformers - it's worth the wait!Plan on spending another S$20 dollars for a locker there as they do not let you on the roller coaster with anything in your pockets but the ticket (not even your wallet in a pocket with a button) - they literally made me turn my pockets inside out...

review_292483720,“A Must Do In Singapore”,"I came here with my brother and my cousin. We had heard about the terrifying twin rollercoasters: Battlestar Galactica. My brother was super excited to go but my cousin and I were very nervous. In the end, my cousin and brother went on Human and I did not go. A little while later, my brother went on Cylon. We all went on the Transformers 4D simulation ride which was very realistic (not just to kids). Next, we went on the Revenge of the Mummy. I did not go but my brother and cousin went. My cousin says it was very exciting and there were many ups and downs including steep drops but nothing compared to Battlestar Galactica. The mummy simulations were not scary to my family. The Treasure Hunters ride had a long wait so we waited only to find out that it was not worth the wait for older kids. Kids from age 2-7 may enjoy it. We ate at the Spice Oasis in the Egyptian section. Though it had no authentic Egyptian food, it had very good Indian Biriyanis and a nice Lebanese dish: hummus and pita. The strawberry slushie was very yummy. Jurassic World had some very fun rides like the Canopy Flyer and the Rapids Adventure. Far Far Away had a Puss In Boots ride which I thought was pretty fun but the best in Far Far Away was Enchanted Airways. The ride was enchanted in a way only Universal Studios could give to you. Overall, we had a lot of fun at Universal Studios. I am a ten year old and I recommend Universal Studios to ages 2-99.

review_292483417,“To being a kid again”,"This place isn't just for kids. Firstly, we went on a normal weekday and started around 2pm where the heat is at its peak. Surprisingly, my girlfriend and I still had a blast even if we didn't get to do the more popular rides like the transformer ride and the two battlestar gallactica rides. The queue time for those rides is 30 minutes on average. Even if you have an express pass, you would still have to wait for they let regular and express ones in alternately by batch. For me, you'll get more tired standing in line than walk around the park under the sun. Though the heat can limit you to fewer photo opportunities. No need to check out every souvenir shop along the way cause there's a shop near the entrance that sells almost everything. Don't miss the Waterworld show, just stay far away from the performers as possible to avoid getting wet. We had the most laughs in Shrek 4d, the most thrill in Enchanted Airways, and most amazed with the Waterworld show.

The waiting time for the battle star reached 4 hours at one point!!! And even small rides had wait times of 45 min at least. The maximum capacity for the park needs to be lowered (if there even is one since it seems like the management values profit over anything else) The rides themselves are pretty good (though the constant breakdowns are suspect- perhaps due to sheer overuse from the instance crowd).Some intervention is desperately needed.

review_291976406,“Massively overcrowded and under serviced”,"This is basically a park where you pay $65 for the privilege of walking around a bunch of overpriced shops full of merchandise and poor quality food with a few rides scattered around.The average queue time for the good rides varied between 2 and 3 hours (on a Monday). You can get around this by buying an express pass which allows you to skip the general queue, however there is no limit on how many of these passes they sell so in reality you pay an extra $30pp to join a slightly shorter queue at each ride as so many people have them. I still had to queue for 1 hour with the express pass to get on the Battlestar rollercoaster. The food courts are a joke too. Obviously the food is terrible but you have to fight off people to even get a seat. It took us about 30mins to get though the queue and get a seat just to eat some crappy hamburgers. If you are not an assertive person you may never get a seat!Unless you are a hardcore roller coaster fan I would give this park a miss. The Battlestar Galactica ride is fantastic but it's an expensive and trying day to experience it.

Lots to see and do. The shows are great, in particular Lights, Camera, Action! and Water World. Ride times can get really long so if you don't intend to buy an express park (you can buy these once you are inside the park so don't feel pressured to do it outside the park) maybe get there early, ride the rides you really want to ride early. We found that Revenge of the Mummy didn't get busy but pretty much everything else did. The Transformers Ride got up to about 90 minutes as did The Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. Battle Star Galactica, in both the Humans and Cyclones lines, had a wait time of 120 minutes plus.

review_291407236,“Fun but mixed feelings”,"Visited with my hubby and 2 teens, on a week day not in school holidays. The park was supposedly quite but wait times for some of the rides were up to 2 hours! After waiting over an hour for the first ride, which was a very basic kiddy ride, we went and purchased an express pass which gave us an express pass for $50 each for one time only on each ride, then if you wish to ride on the same ride again you go back in the regular line. You can buy an unlimited express pass which is dearer. Believe me it is so worth it as it is not much fun in the heat , waiting in a line for up to 2 hrs for a very short ride! Express lines on this day got us on most rides within 10 minutes. At times you can still have hour long wait times with an express pass depending how busy it is. The park is well set out and does have some great rides. Not as good as Queenslands theme parks I think. Maybe they need to limit the number of people going through the gates to cope with the crowds. In saying that if you are prepared for the crowds and waits then just go with it and if you can buy an express pass. If you can book your entry tickets online to avoid the line ups at the gate also. Worth a visit but be prepared.

review_291315944,“Very poorly managed - don't bother!”,"We visited on a weekday, not in school holidays, and the wait times for the rides were unacceptable. We have been to all the theme parks on the Gold Coast Australia and to other theme parks overseas and they are all managed better than this one. We lined up for a roller coaster and it said there was a 90 minute wait but it ended up being 2 hours and 15 mins. The park should not offer the express passes as the only people who get to go on all the rides are the people who want to pay a fair bit extra for the passes. The entry fee is already expensive as it is. EuroDisney have a better system where you can get your ride time, go away and do something else, and come back at your ride time. Hundreds of people also were waiting in the sun for a stunt show and ten minutes after it was due to start we were all turned away with no reason except that it had been cancelled. The only time we managed to get on rides without too long a wait was very late in the day, but it closed at 7pm. This park is very poorly managed and if you've been to other theme parks you are likely to be very disappointed and frustrated. Save your money and go to other attractions on Sentosa Island instead.

review_291289192,“Easy to get to”,"What we liked most about Universal Studios was the ease of access in getting there. You can catch the MRT then the SkyTrain Monorail which takes you right to the door. What we didn't like was the 40 minute queue time for most of the rides. Also, what we didn't know at the time because we bought our tickets before we got there, was that there is an ""Express"" ticket you can purchase that saves you queuing up for rides. This gives you access to the ""express lane"" which zips past the regular queue and gets you on the rides within minutes. I would recommend spending the extra money and purchasing the express ticket as you get quite hot and sweaty standing amongst the crowds for what feels like hours waiting to get onto a 2 minute ride. As expected, food and drinks are very expensive but the rest rooms were spotlessly clean. Having been to Universal Studios in Los Angeles, California and Queensland, Australia, I found the Singapore version to be a little smaller, just as expensive and same, same but different.

I had to buy tickets again at gate. Very expensive. Now must try and get refund of previously purchased tickets.Very confusing at gate sales. All signage was for membership. This is what I paid for before and failed.Most staff rude. No, extremely rude. No smiles or words of thank you or anything. Very abrupt answers to queries. Very expensive for every thing. Food and drinks, unbelievable. I have been to several Universal Studios in other countries and enjoyed them. Not this place. Cannot recommend to anyone and will definitely not be returning.

review_291003100,“Great day”,"Had a great day here. Lots of people and lots of queuing. Probably worth while paying for the fast pass. If you can't afford that some of the rides have single riders lanes which are a bit faster. Lots of eating venues. Not cheap but lots of choices. Easy to get to on the cable car. Had the usual amount of shops if you want a momento.

review_290975580,"“Expensive, hot and too busy though very Entertaining USS on Sentosa”","Nice rides but please do come early as both weekends and weekdays as of 11:00 hours the Universal Studios become too crowded (mostly with tourist from China who frequently do not speak English and are not that courteous... In fact aggressive and que jumpers).Park opens 09:00 and closes 19:00 hours, so be prepared.Do not stand too long in the que by either buying express tickets of just jump the que legally by using the great benefit 'single riders' que.Our 3 sons (7-12) loved the Ancient Egypt part with great rides (e.g. revenge if the mummy) and superb actors on the street with Egyptian princess to take gorgeous pictures.Battlestar Gallactica is must enjoy roller coaster and both in blue as red version (do take the more thrilling hangging part Vs the more soft core sitting roller coaster).Furthermore, great rides are Jurrasic World and Transformers.Especially Transformers is one of the best 4D similators on the globe, fire/water/wind and thrilling 3D rides during the Megatron / OptimusPrime battles...For kids and teenagers (8-18) best including thrill seeking adults ;-)

review_290975115,“Tips especially for families with young children”,"Just visited USS on a public holiday last week and had a great time. Here are some tips for other families with young children.1. Book tickets online and print them beforehand. Try to arrive early and queue up at the Guest Services to collect tickets and meal vouchers (if these are included in your tickets). Also to collect wrist band for Express/Universal Express passes (all members of group must be there for this).2. Get the Universal Express pass if you are there on a weekend/public holiday. I feel conflicted on this, since if everyone gets the Pass, then it won't be much faster, but I think if you have young children, it's really hard to be waiting in line for a long time and for such a short ride. With the Universal Express pass, you can go on their favourite kiddy rides multiple times painlessly. 3. Arrive early say around 930 am so that you can enter the park around 945 am. With the Universal Pass or Express Pass, you can enter via the priority queue and that's very cool. Make sure you queue up at the right queue! If unsure, just ask the stafff members around. But even without the Express pass, since they let people in from 945 am, it's good to be there early, as there would be a queue building up already.4. Try to start with the most popular rides first if you are early. Or go straight to the Lost World at the end for the Flying Dinosaur ride. It would be very empty at that time since most people would be wandering around the entrance area of the park. Likewise if you are targeting the Battlestar rides and the other very popular adult rides, do go straight there if you are early. Even if you don't have an express pass, you can get up those rides quite quickly if you are early.5. If you are there on a public holiday/ weekend, the parade is quite nice for young children. Try to be there about 20 minutes before the starting time to get a good seat on the curb area. I think adults can give the parade a miss with not much loss.6. The RWS app is quite useful for real time wait times. it only works for IOS though which is a pity.7. For the Sesame Street show in the theatre, if your children would like to do things like high-five with the characters, try to sit nearer the aisles, e.g. at the third row from the front where the characters might walk down the stage to interact briefly with the audience.8. I think many young children find the Shrek 4 D show quite scary so do prepare them well beforehand, or opt for the alternative non moving seats. Similarly the LIghts Camera Action is very scary for young children as it shows a mock hurricane storm scene. 9. Check your children's height outside the park area if you are early so that they don't get disappointed just at the entrance of the attraction. The staff are quite strict so even if the children miss the minimum height by 1 cm, they will not let them up. 10. Definitely bring your stroller or you could rent one. They have double strollers too.That's all I can think of for now! hope you have a great time there!

review_290952330,“MUST MUST MUST Visit!!!!”,"No trip to Singapore can be complete without spending a day at Universal Studios in Sentosa. The theme park is conveniently accessible by MRT and taxisUniversal Studios is divided on the basis of several themes. Each theme has 4-5 rides each, suited to different levels of adventure. Transformers 4D & Galactica in Sci-Fi area are absolutely fantastic; and so in Revenge of the Mummy in Ancient Egypt. Waterworld in Lost World was supposed to be another great experience, but was closed the day we visitedFar Far Away & Madagascar were low on adventure levels, but still a treat for people who love both the movies. Hollywood & New York have great photo-opps. Was blown away by Steven Spielberg Show.Tip: Reach the park and queue up atleast 40-45mins before the park opens. Make a dash to Sci-fi once inside, and rush to either Transformers or Galactica or Human. These are the most popular rides and the waiting time is insane once the park fills up

Nice shows especially the Waterworld show. Only minus point is that not too many cartoon characters walking around. The management should arrange more of this for children to take pictures. Overall, had a lot of fun.

There were food joints upon entry, just like america, which was great for grabbing food for breakfast before entry.

The park wasn't busy which was great as wait times weren't so long for rides and shows. Overall, it was a great family day out.

Both the rollercoaster rides ( battlestar and cylon) would occasionally be stopped for maintenance. Queues were long, always more than 120 minutes for the popular rides especially for transformers and the rollercoasters. A word of advice, buy the express tickets, that's the only way you can cut the long queues. And wear light comfortable clothes too.

review_290748110,“Ridiculous waiting times....ruined the experience”,"We got to Universal Studios at approx 11am (one hour after it opens), on a Monday. First ride was a 60 minute wait and it just got worse from there, waits up to 150 minutes on a really hot day. Stayed there until 630pm and queues didn't go down all day. We needed a locker for one ride and couldn't believe they were still charging per hour for lockers with such long waits. Teenage kids were most interested in the roller coasters but with such insanely long waits, it just wasn't worth it, gave up. Would not bother going back. Recommend doing other activities on Santosa Island instead if it's a busy time of year (I think it's school holidays in Singapore).

review_290576733,“Good place to have fun in Singapore”,"The theme park is located at Sentosa where the Sentosa casino is located so expect to find good restaurants there. Seaworld is there too. The theme park has a lot of fun rides and my favourite ride is the transformers rollercoasters. There are 2 types of rollercoasters,one is seated the other one is hanging. Both are fun. You are not allowed to bring food in so don't bother bringing food. Be sure to bring portable fan,umbrella and extra shirt as Singapore is a tropical country. The theme park is not as big as it's USA counterpart so don't expect a lot from Singapore's Universal Studio. Getting there is easy by MRT,bus or taxi.

review_290559541,“Fun Day - Get There Early”,"We spent a hot Singapore day at Universal Studios this weekend (extra busy on weekends). Our express pass was worth every penny ($50 a head). To get an express pass unlimited was a further $40 a head. The woman at guest services told me that the cost changes according to demand. By late afternoon the express passes were ceasing to be sold since the express lines were also busy. We used our express passes on the Battlestar Galatica - still a 1hr wait. I noticed that there were more people in the express line than the regular one. On all other rides the express pass significantly sped up the waits. I can't believe that locals wait an hour per ride in the heat for >5min rides. Expect to buy water, and there to be crowds.

It's expensice but will save you HOURS and you'll get to experience so much more.

I was skeptical at first but we managed to do 3 shows, 1 4D adventure cinema, 2 street performance and 4 rides plus lunch in 5 hours. We must have equally skipped the same amount of time in queuing. For example, we waited10 mins in a 80 mins queue for treasure hunters. At the end, we thoroughly enjoyed the experience with the energy conserved visiting during the second day of the festive Hari Raya (also Saturday) where the crowd was huge-ish. So the Sing50 pp add on was worth every cent!The studios though small but perfect bite size fun for families with young children.

Facilities were also not maintained well, we were in many queues in the searing heat where the aircon/fans were not turned on.

Smaller than the Universal Parks that are in the states, Universal Singapore is easily doable in one day if you get there early and stay until closing at 7! Everything is super clean (naturally, because it's Singapore) and it's not actually that expensive considering its Singapore and it's universal! Only about $50 U.S. dollars for an adult. But your tickets at Changi Airport though, you'll save a little bit of money! Also right now the walk to Universal from Sentosa across the new boardwalk is free until December, so you can just walk across from sentosa(about 15 min) instead of having to be shoved into a monorail to get there! But the park is fun, and the Cylon side of the Battlestar Galactica ride is a must, as is the Mummy ride! Something for everyone here :)

review_290058584,“Beware the crowds”,"Universal studios is basically rides and restaurants/cafes/eateries and merchandising. Nothing else. If you are planning to go, unless you buy the front of line tickets, you will waIt a minimum of 80 minutes for a ride, to over 2 hours. The day we went, even the front of line tix were sold out. We managed NO rides, as to wait for 2 rides ate into 4 hours of our trip there and we were there for 5 hours. As it turns out, that wouldn't have mattered, as there's nothing else to see or do apart from the odd street show. The donkey show from Shrek was completely filmed, so when they say that children will get a chance to meet, they really won't. Take plenty of money, because even after the admission gouge, you'll be charged up to $30 for a child's water spray bottle, $15 for a burger that anywhere else would be $4, and double the going price for an ice cream. On the plus side, there were plenty of toilets. If you are planning to take a taxi, get ready for another mammoth line and wait to rival that of the Cylons vs Humans roller coaster. Allow one hour.

Try to get there when park opens and go on big rides first as there are long queues as day does by. Typical wait time is one hour which does not give you long to do other thongs in park. You do seem to rush from one ride to another to get your monies worth. Queues are mostly in shade which is very good. We payed just over $300 for a family of 4. Quite expensive for any family but overall worth entrance fee. Lots to see and do. Cartoon characters all around park. Amazing scale of the whole park. Great fun for adults too!

review_289815281,“Wonderful time with 4 year old son”,"Been to USS 4 times since Jun and all visits have been enjoyable.Rides: For my 4 year old son who is 1.08m tall, the only rides he is not allowed on are Battlestar Galactica: Human vs. Cylon and Mummy ride. His fave rides are Puss in Boots, Enchanted Airways (junior roller coaster), Canopy Flyer, Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase, King Julien's Beach Party-Go-Round, Madagascar Crate Adventure, Treasure Hunters, Dino-Soarin'. Daddy and Mummy enjoy the Transformer ride, Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure and Shrek 4D movie.Queues at King Julien's Beach Party-Go-Round and Dino-Soarin’ are rather manageable while queues at Transformer ride was 2 hours and Sesame Street ride is 80min today. Express pass is definitely helpful for most rides on weekends or public holiday like today.Do get the showtimes available near the maps near the entrance after entering the gates and plan your rides to fit in the shows.USS Annual pass: Bought the RWS Invite attraction pass which is the USS annual pass which comes with the RWS Invite benefits. Add another S$100 for the Universal Express Unlimited for the annual pass. For those residing in Singapore or coming to Singapore often with young kids who needs to nap (that means can only spend a few hours in the park), the annual pass is rather worth it for multiple visits.Treats: It was my hubby’s birthday this month. We went to the guest service at USS to collect meal voucher and retail vouchers of S$10 each. Also at the RWS Invite service counter beside Cedele, he received a USS notebook. For my son, he receives an ice-cream at Gloria Shacks for every visit to USS.Meals: My son loves the salmon rice bento at Gloria Shacks. For health conscious mummies, this is probably one of the healthier meals available in the park. Downside is no aircon for Gloria Shacks. For mummies who are not so particular, Mel’s kids meal which consist of fries, nuggets, apple/orange juice and a souvenir (S$10) is value for money. Dining in park earns RWS Invite $. Alternatively can step out of the Malaysian Food Street outside the park to enjoy a meal which also earns RWS Invite $ (lower %).Overall, a great theme parks for families with kids with lots of fun at rides, shows and food.

I have to say that Queensland theme parks are bigger and better than universal at Singapore. we did have fun taking photos and looking around at what they have.

review_289735887,“Universal Studios Singapore”,"A good day out with the kids. Ask for the lunch combo tickets at the gate which includes adult entry and one combo meal per adult for less than the listed single ticket price (this may have been a promotion at the time but not advertised widely as it is more for the locals).The longest wait was for Jurassic Park rapids but most other rides were no longer than 20 minutes but it really just comes down to timing. We went on a weekday.Many food venues of varying tastes are available.The Mummy rollercoaster was my highlight, and the kids enjoyed various rides and attractions such as Shrek 4D cinema, Puss in Boots rollercoaster etc.A one day visit is sufficient and much too see.

review_289691745,“Transformers is a must try!”,"USS is a nice stop for this with kids and kids at heart. We were only there for half a day and I must say that's definitely not enough to enjoy the park. I love how efficient the queueing is and they let you know how long you have to wait. The highlight of our experience was the transformers ride. It definitely was a whole new experience. Also, we didn't have to wait too long as we lined up around 6. There were also fireworks in the evening while we ate churros. Would absolutely come back!!!

We went to every single attraction there from the moment they opened to when they closed. We had so much fun on all the rides we only missed one because we did not see it there until closing time. Definitely will go back again. Have been to Disneyland in both Hong Kong and Tokyo and comparing the rides Universal Studios definitely comes out on top. It was great to be crazy kids for the day, a day my seven year old will never forget has not stopped talking about it since.I highly recommend that you purchase the express pass as this was just a dream, no waiting in the long lines!

review_289394642,"“Small, Long Queues and boring rides”","After experiencing other amusement parks around the world, including Ocean Park in HK, Dream world in Australia, Lotte World in S.Korea, Universal Studios in LA America; this whole amusement park felt too small with too little rides. To add on to that, while the price of the tickets on its own were expensive, the queues were so long (and take into account the hot sunny weather of Singapore) where it seems necessary to buy the express pass (allows you to skip the queues for SOME, not all rides). I was reluctant to pay more for the express pass so what i would recommend to others would be to try the single riders queue if you are okay with it. That allowed me to take most of the rides before it closed. the food choices inside are limited and costly and the tickets to their shows have ridiculously long queues as well. You end up paying to see the surroundings, maybe take a few rides, and spend most of your time in queue.

review_289393330,"“Rides, rides and more rides!”","Been there twice, there are a few must go rides like Transformer, Battlestar, Revenge of the Mummy and Jurassic park. While the rest you can wait when you have the done those rides mentioned above. However if you have children or elderly with you, maybe you can consider riding Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase, Shrek 4-D Adventure, Madagascar and many more. However the worst ride I did was Treasure Hunter and Accelerator ( would recommend this 2 rides). Regarding on the queue time for the rides, Battlestar took me the longest to queue 75 mins for a ride of +-2mins.Locker was also a problem, as some of the rides require you to deposit all your belonging into the lockers as they do not want any loss item to fall off during the rides.Looking for food was alright as there is many places for you to eat however do expect queue at the more popular restaurant like western restaurant.To avoid long queue at the popular rides, just head there and wait for the park to be open and head straight to the Battlestar ride to avoid wasting of time queuing.

It is a great place to go to with your family and friends. The facilities are definitely world class. We had fun but the reason I gave it a 4 is because the roller coaster was closed when went there. I didn't see any info about this online before going, we were only advised that it was closed when we were already there purchasing the tickets.Tip:Obviously the lines are pretty long especially on weekends and holidays so it is more practical to line up in the Singles Line where the queue is shorter but the downside is that you might not be able to enjoy the ride together with your family and friends. Normal queue would take even more than an hour to line up while this other queue could take maybe max 20mins and sometimes no waiting time even.

review_289302801,“Long queues and over priced - Never again!”,"This place is incredibly expensive for the sub-optimal experience offered. Almost $400 for a family of six. Since when is a 13 year old an adult?! Once inside the queues for rides are ridiculously long - some up to 90 minutes. One ride the queue was 30 minutes for a 1 minute ride. The issue is far too many locals have the annual express pass and they get to jump the queue leaving those of us who only paid $400 to enter waiting and waiting. The staff look so miserable doing there jobs. In fairness it is hot an uncomfortable. The choices are to pay an extra $50 per person to go in the express lane, or queue for hours in stifling heat for very short rides. Not worth it.Unless you have a burning desire to queue or have never been to an attraction like this I would save your money.

review_289154264,“It's alright ....”,"I've been the one in LA and had high hopes when visiting this one whilst staying in Singapore. It has the same cleanliness and a good atmosphere but it was all a little bit ho hum. There are probably only 3 good rides here that will give you a thrill and the rest are for kiddies. If u have younger kids then it should be great. But if your a bit older and looking for a lot of thrill rides then you may be disappointed. Because of the heat and humidity of Singapore my advice is go during the week and make sure u are there when it opens at 10. That way u can do all the rides before the crowds get there and before it's too hot. After lunch the place is packed and awfully hot. After the water world show at 1.30 we were pretty much ready to leave. Also if u get there early you can get free locker use for 45 minutes. You have to use the lockers when going on some of the rides. Because there are not as many people there you can get on and off the rides without having to pay for the locker. I wouldn't go again but it was pleasant enough.

It worked well no waiting.The rides : Transformers was the first and the one with an surprised feeling attached to it. Just loved it. Madagascar and Jurassic park was fun too. But one hell of a ride was the MUMMY and the ride was SCARY!! Overall a perfect place to have fun and age definitely doesn't matter here. Everyone seems to have enjoyed. A must visit. One more point as far the souvenirs are concerned they are slightly expensive compared to the local market, but as a memory string attached you can pick up a few overall quality is good.

review_289053941,“Lots of fun but go on a weekday if possible”,"It was a second trip to USS at Sentosa, have always loved it. The queues are manageable and they always indicate queuing times so I'm running to and fro each ride based on queue times. This time I also bought the express pass which is an additional $50 but oh so worth it. I was surprised at the variety of restaurants in there, usually theme parks don't have good options but USS was great. And of course did lots of souvenir shopping. Recommend the Transformer ride, the Mummy ride and the Jurassic ride if you are adrenaline junkies. I waited for guests to be done with the Jurassic ride and bought their raincoats off them for half price. Battlestar Galatica was closed when I was there, that was the only dampener. Definitely much better than Disneyland Hong Kong I have to say, as the staff and visitors kept to their lines in an orderly fashion. When I was in Disneyland HK Chinese mainlanders were cutting my queues and there's nothing we can do about it, especially if you look as Chinese as them.

Can get very hot in the park and food and drink options not the best however you can get a pass out and eat at one of the other Sentosa eateries.

In the heat my patience was tested and overall I didn't enjoy myself. The rides were good but for all that waiting I don't think it was worth it although the staff on the rides were nice. Gave up waiting at the American Diner as there was one line and it was nearly out the door. The line didn't move after 20 mins so we left. There are plenty of other food courts though. One thing that did feel like magic was a cold drink in AC! The bathrooms were very clean and plentiful. At the end of the day we waited another 1 hour at the taxi stand.

review_288695329,“Sentosa really busy but fun”,"We arrived by cable car which drops you at Imbiar station where we bought our tickets .We purchased 2 day fun passesat $139.00 for an adult and $99.00 for child 12 and under(sure you could get cheaper maybe online) which were lucky we did as we spent the entire day at Universal but had originally considered doing tgat plus otger attractions around the island..The park is small by comparison to others say on the Gold Coast and with alot less thrills and really only has one big coaster Galagcita and one smaller indoor one in the Egyptian area-we travelled with 2 x 12 year olds who just wanted speed thrills so were pretty much limited to these 2.We would highly recommend buying the express tickets at time of purchase which we didnt do and regretted so much.-you can upgrade anytime during the day but best straight up.This is an extra$50 single ride or $75 multiple but worth it unless you want to queue for 2 hours ( and we went on a Monday supposedly quiet...?) The express queues were virtually straight through each time so very frustrating watching them have lots of rides and our kids waiting in the heat. This probably doesn't matter as much with little kids as the queuesway shorter on their rides although a couple ours went on were still 20-25 minutes. So a huge part of your day is about waiting. Oh and a word of advice if placing your belongings in lockers always keep $10 in your pocket as its the only way you'll be able to pay to open your locker...to retrieve your wallet as you usually (but not always) pay after usuage not before.If you forget there is a sometimes a locker attendant who you can borrow from...there is a sign very small and probably needs to be more prominent. Rides close at 7 so dont expect to get on any after that even though tgey advertise park open till 9.30 it really is only a gimmick to get you into their merchandise shops and spend big.Last cable car leaves at 9.30 and then when you get to other end unless you call and book a taxi expect to wait in another queue for 45-1 hour( about 10 min walk outside MacDonalds) You cannot hail a cab anywhere in Singapore until after 9.30 pm and not from a bus lane and if it has BUSY/ON CALL it wont stop for you.-you have to go to a taxi rank,hotel lobby or call them.

review_288368680,“Needs more balance between Adults and Kiddie Rides!”,"We are locals in our early thirties, and finally visited the famed Universal Studios Singapore recently. Having heard so many things about it, we decided ""what the hey"" and booked our tickets to experience it once and for all. Having given many many advice from colleagues and friends, we were well prepared on what time to arrive, what to bring, and park operations etc. We hope to share some of these as well as other tips we discovered. :)The Good:Just like everything else in Singapore, orders and rules are followed to a T. This was greatly appreciated, especially when there was queue cutting, or jumps into the express lanes. Or visitors trying to hustle their way into the rides without storing their bags/belongings. Often these were handled professionally and quickly.Bag and loose items are able to be stored for free (45 to 55 mins), at each of the major rides. The locker user interface can be a bit tricky the first time round, but there is always an attendant nearby to help. Past the first check attendants, there are some water coolers for when you get thirsty while in the queue. This also means that for some rides which do allow bags, you can take the opportunity to fill up your water bottles. By the way, water in Singapore is perfectly safe to drink, even straight from the tap. Often at the restrooms there are also water coolers. So avoid those $4 bottled waters! We bought an inclusive ticket which had a free meal voucher, so redeemed it for lunch at the Discovery Food Court (Jurassic Park). For dinner, we had western fare at KT's grill. The former exceeded our expectation, especially first for being a food court, second for being in a theme park, where food is often overpriced and not very good. While still overpriced, (SGD12 for chicken rice) we are very pleased to find the food quality is high, and that it looked/tasted good. The portions of all the foods we saw here were also sizeable and generous, which were a plus. We checked however at nearby burger/hotdog shack Fossil Fuels, and found the portions to be measly..! If only we had time to survey all the restaurants!The dinner at KT's Grill however, for restaurant price and quality, fared lower. The beer-batter fish and chips, and rotisserie chicken was passable but did not knock our socks off. They cost SGD16 and SGD18 respectively.The Not-So GoodThe rides themselves were a mixed bag. Being major thrill-seekers, as were most visitors between ages 15 to 30s, the Battlestar Galactica rides were the biggest draw. Cylon being the most scary-fun the park has to offer, Human being the second. Other rides that are enjoyable enough for thrill-seeking adults would be The Mummy and Transformers. Canopy Flyer was also very fun, not scary but just a quick aerial zip around the Jurassic Park Area. Do try to get the front facing seats, and possibly the first row!Other things not to be missed is the Hollywood Dream Parade, which starts at Waterworld and ends at Hollywood St. A medium sized parade, of about 7 themed floats, but still entertaining nonetheless. The biggest draws here are always the hunky Anubis henchmen with the chiselled six packs, and sexy Anck-su-namun from The Mummy float. For some reason, the Jurassic Park one was dialled way down for the kids. The signature bellow of the T-Rex was more like a sigh and the Raptors were dancing to the beat, which was just...out of character. The nightly fireworks show is also not to be missed, it does get a bit squeezy so try to get a good spot at the waterfront early. Due to the proximity of the fireworks, the Battlestar Galactica ride does shut down momentarily at about 7pm, and then reopened thereafter. The fireworks also signal the end for the day pass holders, which are then required to exit. The night-time visitors are usually identified with a blue wrist band, they get the run of the park from about 2pm to 11pm.Everything else is actually quite tame, and geared towards kids. Which is why we changed strategies midway, and just repeatedly visited the above mentioned rides until we had our fill. We only ventured through the other areas as a breather, or just to explore.The newest attraction Puss in Boots, while huge and domineering in its sprawl and height, was also a major kiddie ride and was a bit of a downer. Shrek 4D and Lights Camera Action are attractions suitable for both adults and kids, both being quite ""passive"" attractions, where you sit/stand back and enjoy.The one troubling attraction was Waterworld. It had a lot of guns, explosions and also fair bit of violence. I remembered being a kid, high on theme park adrenaline seeing a similar live action show, and loving it, recreating the sequences weeks after with my friends at home. Only it was a Power Rangers show, and we were technically battling monsters aka people in padded costumes. For Waterworld, there was a heroine character that was beaten and kicked, people being shot at, falling off heights, as well as, many many guns. I hope the kids watching don't absorb too much of the show, because while it has its place in the theme park environment, kids might try to bring what they see here back home, or to school. Parents might want to take a bit of caution here, especially if you know you have pretty impressionable kids. Maybe a gentle explanation, prior to the show would be ideal. Or avoid it completely.I would like to express that the park and its sponsor Singtel should revisit this show's theme, as the relevance of Waterworld is way past its prime. Most people don't even know it was a movie! From 1995! That's 20 years ago! And secondly, we should advocate entertainment without violence. There really is no other way around that, especially with children audiences present. The Bad:There is not a lot of bad to bring up about the park itself. While we felt the rides were pandering way too much to the children, it still has its draws. We were glad that we got the Express Unlimited access. This really helped a bunch, because we were able to literally finish a ride and get back on it five-six times in a row. Note: There are two kinds of Express tickets (Single and Unlimited). We never had to wait more than 20 mins, even at the peak hours. But it came at a hefty price, the Express Unlimited costs an additional SGD70 on top of the Adult admission ticket. All in all, for the day's outing, we paid about SGD180 (all ticket costs including meals). Our adult ticket was a ""Singapore Special"" Promo at SGD68 which included 1 meal voucher, redeemable at the various restaurants within, and also a special gift, which was already fully redeemed at the time. (sadness!) These promo tickets are still available either at the booth or online, until end of July 2015. But if you are buying online, you do need to be in Singapore to enjoy it ( they track the IP address, boo! )Conclusion:All in all, it was a memorable day, the Battlestar Galactica rides are so fun and we will remember our numerous runs on it for years to come. We used up all our adrenaline stores on those two rides, towards the end, we were no longer fighting the rises, loops and turns, we were just enjoying it like we were flying! One thing that we feel does need mentioning is queue etiquette. I will not go out and name the nationalities which display poor etiquette at the queues, (there are namely two nationalities) but they really do make an unpleasant experience even more so. Even while were in the express lanes, we saw numerous times, some visitors discretely jumping over and trying to hustle their way into the lane, hoping the attendant will pity them and let them go onto the ride. There were also instances in the express lane that these nationalities would try to squeeze through to the front. When confronted, they defiantly shouted that they are Express holders, and that meant they could cut in front other Express holders. Singaporeans in general are an accepting meek bunch, but I could see some tension firing up at a few queues, which were directly caused by these nationalities. It goes without saying that other foreign visitors who are more used to theme park queueing were also appalled by the blatant disrespect to other patrons in the queue. Especially so when these good people have been waiting themselves for up to 2hrs or more, in the non-Express queues.If you are visiting USS, please be ethical and respectful of other patrons. Everyone is there to have a good time, not just you.We are very thankful to the many young Singaporean men and women working the tills, politely but sternly managing the crowds. Not all of them were good, but most stuck their ground and executed their jobs perfectly. Apart from the quality rides and visual/aural thematics of the park, these dedicated individuals make Universal Studios Singapore a world class attraction!:)

With the fast pass we managed to do all the attractions in 3.5 hours, which was about as long as it was possible to stay in the sun.

What this allows you priority on access to popular tides. The express gives you one express access per ride while ultimate is as it says unlimited access to numerous popular tides. If you don't take up this option expect to wait 60min or more in line per popular rides, express usually gets you I between 5 zany 15 minute.Food isn't cheap but probebly on par with most other facilities.There are senior discounts just bring relevant Info such as passport etc.

review_288028629,“Universal Studios Singapore - A dad's review of express pass”,"Overall a great day about for Mum, Dad and our 9 year old boy. We arrived before the gates opened at 10am. We followed the advice of others on Trip Advisor and bought the express lane passes for $60 per person - ouch! Was it worth it? Probably - just. We were not interested on going on the scary big roller coaster rides (which attract the longest queues) and many of the rides earlier in the day we had a very short wait so we didn't need to use our single express visit. We did go back on a few rides later in the day and avoided 80 min waits (cut to 10-15min) which was handy. If you get there first thing (we went on a Saturday in school hols) you can probably go on most of the rides before lunchtime with 15-30 min wait without an express pass. The express pass gives you one visit unless you buy the unlimited express which is $80 per person. You can decide to upgrade from single visit express to unlimited at anytime once inside the park. The express pass also gets you discount on meals and some other outlets (not universal merch). The express pass also gets you into the various shows but we found there was not really a long delay for these shows even in bthe afternoon. Having said that we went to the Lights Camera Action show and the express pass saved wait time and got us access to front row lower tier. Perfectly good experience on the second tier without pass.I would buy the pass if if I had teenage kids who wanted to go crazy on rides (and your budget allows). If your kids are say 10 y.o. and you're on a budget I'd give them a miss - on the proviso you can get there at the opening and crowds are not huge. We were told 14,000 people were coming the day we went and they probably did as it is a big park but it would have been later in the day. We also followed the advice of others and started clockwise. This was great advice as the rides start from less scary to more scary so it is easier to gauge what the ride will be like.Madagascar is a gentle river cruise with some non scary effectsPuss in Boots looks scary but isn't at all (and I'm no thrill seeker). Out son did not want any part of it but eventually coaxed him on and he enjoyed it. It's a family friendly version of a roller coaster but you sit in a carriage which is suspended like a gondola.Canopy Flyer goes high which gives a good view of city. One fast rush right near the end. Better to sit facing forward if possible.Our favourite ride was Rapids Adventures which is a water ride through Jurassic Park. Every chance you will get wet but it was refreshing.Movies and shows all good. A word of warning, the Water World show glorifies gun use and violence and affirms a patriarchal society. It has impressive effects but is quite violent at times - the worst scene is one scene where the leader of the bad guys hits the damsel in distress to the ground. It is held in a huge arena and there's so much noise and effects that a lot of what I noticed would go over kids heads but I thought I'd give you the heads up.Good day out but like most theme parks - you have to be prepared to part with big $.

review_287767028,“Excellent place to spend your day”,"2nd time to Universal studios and me & my family thoroughly enjoyed it.I have been to a couple of Disneylands ,ocean park etc but this place beats them hands down in ride quality .Few Tips :1) Go on weekdays. On weekends , waiting time for some rides can get up to 60-75 mins.2) Arrive early by 10am. 3) Dont click pics at the entrance in the morning. Rush to get best rides . You can click pics while coming out.4) Few Must Do rides as per my Liking : Transformers , Cylon , Human (All 3 in sci fi cities) , Rapid RIdes (Jurrasic park) and Mummy Ride. Rest you can explore at your choice.5) Carry a water bottle. Lot of places to refill water.6) Avoid eating in restaurants.Food is overpriced and lacks taste.7) Book online for a S$7-8 discount till 31st July. Do check the promotions page on official site though.8) Avoid rides with waiting time of 30 mins or more.9) Being a small place you can cover 80% of the rides in one day. May be all of them if its a weekday.We went on a Sat and still managed to cover all but 2 rides as the waiting time on both of them was more than 60 mins.Catch various street shows and dont forget to catch 'Lights , Camera & Action' show where they show you a live scene of a hurricane destroying New York City.Best Ride for me Was Transformers...its 3 D effects along with roller coaster capabilities is beyond the imagination of Disneylands.

review_287460614,“Kids just loved it!”,"Spent an exciting day at Universal Studios, the rides were great and the kids had a blast. A few tips for the day, get a studio map as soon as you arrive, if you go clockwise around the park the rides get progressively scarier, starting with the very tame Madagascar and culminating with the heart stopping Galatica - that ride is wild! We were there on a very hot day so broke our rides up between the open air roller coasters and the 4D simulations, like Shrek, Transformers. Sitting in the air conditioning is just enough of a refresher to set you up for the next outdoor roller coaster. If you want to See the Waterworld show leave it till the end of the day, 4.45pm is less crowded and everyone is grateful for an opportunity to just sit and watch the action, let the kids sit in the front rows and get soaked! Pay the premium and buy the express pass, it is so worth it, I begrudgingly bought it and it proved to be the best money I spent. Standing in a queue for an hour in the humidity can very quickly dampen the enthusiasm for even the most exciting ride. For teenagers I'm not convinced Universal Studios Singapore would rate as highly as other theme parks, but for families with younger children it is a fantastic day out, expect your wallet to get a good workout, get ready for the queues, just do it!

The standout rides for us (2 adults and a 12 year old) were the Battlestar Galactica roller coasters (awesome but scary) and the Transformers ride... My daughter also liked the Mummy (sort of like a ghost train). Suggest you pack water as it's super hot walking around and wear clothes which will dry out as on some of the rides you will get wet! Also, it's not advertised but you can get a re-entry stamp so you can leave the park to grab lunch in one of the cafes near the entrance - a much better option then the food halls in the park.

So we grabbed the opportunity and did Transformer Ride (waiting time was 20min, thanks to lunch time) along with other small rides and show(Accelerator and Steven Spielberg Show). Transformer Ride is another must do, effects are superb.Wait time for third major ride (Revenge of the Mummy) was 20min on display but it took us 40min. This was ok.

review_287018915,“Lots of fun ”,"Went to USS after visiting EuroDisney and this place is much better. Similar feel, but much better laid out easier to find your way around and importantly the rides are much better. The only advice I'd give is buy an express pass regardless of the cost as you will be able to get a lot more of the park done in a quicker fashion. Waits of up to an hour can be mind numbing at best.

review_287014935,“A Place worth visiting!”,"The place is all about rides and activities. Whoever like these will enjoy it. Liked the Mummy ride and Transformers ride a lot. People who are having Heart problems are not recommended. Only problem is the Queue for those rides. It a full day visit. Unless a full day is dedicated, all the areas cannot be covered. It is better to carry Camera & wearing floaters rather than going in Shoes as there will be few Wet activities.

review_287005011,“Great place to visit with family”,"I visited on 8th July with my family + cousins. We had lot of fun and find the place good. Staff are not as friendly or service oriented as themed park in the UAE. They were not bad but I think I got used to the pampering of customers in theUAE. Attractions were basic to me,again I think that the roller coaster were not as extreme as I got used to as Ferrari World. With all the comparison I have made over, I think find Universal Studio a great place as my family and I had fun, that is what is important right now. Enjoyed every single second of our visit. I honestly love it.

review_286939307,“Worth to visit on weekday not weekend or public holiday”,"Organize and plan everything before visit any Universal studio. Check via internet what you can't or can visit according to age.Best time to visit always on week day to minimize very long queue and to enjoy most of the attraction they offered.Not as big as Universal studio in Orlando but still good planning needed here. Very easy to get to this park even you solo traveller . Check on schedule of every attraction . Please do put on your comfortable shoes as you will do a lot of walk around the park, bring extra cloth as some the attraction will make you very wet. Enjoy and have a blast people.

I enjoyed most of the games there and by taking pictures. Just that I felt very hot during afternoon time and it made me get tired faster. Another minus point, the wait time for some shows and rides was quite long. Another 1 thing that impressed me was the public toilet inside USS really clean. It was like inside a shopping mall. I should say bravo to Singapore on this matter. Really salute them on this.

I personally think if you are already paying so much for the entry then buying the express pass is not such a bad idea as it allow's you to enter each ride with hardly any wait. However, if you are a group of friends who can chat their way to the 60 mins waiting time then you will be fine without the express pass. Have fun here.

review_286563306,“Lots of fun”,"A great family day out. We were there when the park opened and it was already very crowded. My advice is if you can afford to pay the extra $70 per person to purchase an unlimited express pass, do it. Without an express pass you could be waiting in line for well over an hour at the popular rides like Transformers and Jurassic Park. With the express pass the longest we waited was about ten minutes. I do realise the extra cost is probably out of reach for some families though. The Transformers ride is fantastic and so realistic it is frightening. I was very surprised by the cost of food and drinks. Normally at theme parks the cost is ridiculous, but at Universal it is really quite reasonable, a very pleasant surprise. Universal Studios is a must do if visiting Singapore.

review_285683043,“Mostly Great”,"Loved the Transformer ride and both BSG coasters, the Cylon side was half the wait mainly due to the better management of the Express Pass people. On the human side it was 80-90 min wait and they were holding the entire line of ""regular"" waiting to let ALL express pass holders go first so as long as there were EP people there the line didn't move. On the Cylon side they would take a few EP along with some regular line people, keeping everyone moving. There were typically only 10-15 people in the EP line so they still went very quickly. I expect to stand in lines it was just frustrating to think you're next after waiting 75+ minutes and then a whole line of pass holders show up and you don't make the next train or even 2. And we love the mummy ride but the noise while in que is CRAZY! I'm not sure why it's so bad in that line and not the others, maybe b/c there's no video to listen to? But we spent the majority of that 40 min wait with our ears covered. And we have 2 preteen boys and are used to noise. It's really miserably loud.

review_285335675,“Nth time to USS”,"Though this isn't the first time I have been to Universal Studios, this is the only time I remembered to take pictures *grin*. What better ways to remember something than to blog about it and upload tons of photos on Facebook *bigger grin*.Entrance fee is S$68 but we got it lower due to corporate purchase. The price excludes parking.Upon arriving at RWS, you will be greeted with the iconic huge rotating globe and then you will see the entrance right next to it. Oh by the way, lockers are available if you need to keep your luggage. It is not recommended to keep your child in the lockers to avoid suffocation.Our first stop was to the Madagascar section. Was too early for the shows and we weren't particular interested in any rides, so we proceeded on.We then went to Far Far Away land. Had been to the Shrek 4D movies before but don't see why we shouldn't go again. If this is your first time, try to sit in the front blocks coz those are the chairs that moves....yah, you will feel the galloping, the water droplets from Shrek sneezing and all on top of the 3D effect. Pretty cool, I should say. When we got out of the theatre, there was this gift shop that sells drinks in potion bottles. Kindda interesting!Our next stop was the Lost World, which includes Jurassic Park and Water World. In Jurassic Park, there are some kiddy rides here for the not so young kids. At Dino-Soarin, kids can pilot their own Pteranodon! And for those who love water rafting, do head over to the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure. Don't worry about getting wet, there are dryers in the park for you to dry yourself. Just pay.Water World - This is one really interesting show. There are a lot of audience interaction before the proper show starts. And like any other get wet show, do choose the front few rows (blue colored seats) if you want to get really wet....or drenched. You might want to prepare a poncho too. The entire show will involve lots of fire works and water splashing and people falling into water. Definitely not for the faint hearted.Further venturing led us to Ancient Egypt. I am so fascinated by everything in the gift shop. From cute cushion to display items...they are so intricately produced. By the way, Oakley's sunnies are also sold in the shop. Do remember to take pictures with Army of Anubis who will be roaming around.The only part of Sci-Fi city was perhaps the Transformer...or to be exact, Bumblebee! There are lots of exciting rides here if your heart could take it.Ended the entire trip with a walk through Hollywood. The Cruisers were performing various oldies so we stayed until they finish the entire performance and then slowly beat the traffic to walk out of USS. On the whole, it was quite a fulfilling trip.More photos on http://i-wanna-travel.blogspot.sg/2015/07/universal-studio-singapore-3-may-2015.html

If you happen to go on weekends u may facea lot of crowd and hence will have to wait for a ride for at least an hour. so I suggest you start early or if u happen to go late buy the express ticket to get through the line faster.

However, it turned as blessing in disguise as we could leisurely cover the entire park in 3-4 hours. We had taken express pass so that helped saved time as well. Mummy and Transformers were the best rides in my opinion. My daughter enjoyed the road parades and shows as well. The candyland outside the gate is a good replenishment to all the walking and exercise you get at the park.

The rides are based on movies of universal studio. Transformer and mummies rides are especially good. Others are ok. There are no parades and fireworks here as in disneyland .

It was a fairly tame roller coaster type of ride, so suitable for all ages. All the other favourites were still there. There are plenty of choices for dining, and lots of water fountains to keep refilling your water bottles. Lots of photo opportunities with the different characters all around the park. Many seating areas for those who do not go on the rides. Just outside the park is Malaysian Food Street, which is a hawker centre, with beautiful food at excellent prices. We had an excellent chicken, veg and noodle dish for $6SD. Well worth the visit!

The food outlets are equally good( the Italian outlet in New York street serves great pizza).Unlike other Universial Studios areound the world, the queues are much shorter here. I would suggest it is well worth upgrading your ticket to include the express pass. This allows you to join a seperate queue with an even shorter waiting time. The heat in the tropics can be unbearable. therefore the express pass would get you on the ride in a quicker time without waiting in the heat.The staff are amazing, the park is impeccably clean. If you are fortunate enough to be living in Singapore, do consider the annual pass. The value is well worth it for a year of unlimited fun.

review_284602617,“pay 'n wait !”,"Universal Studios in SIngapore is worth the visit. Its smaller than its contemporaries in the US but that is an advantage: you dont have to walk so far. You wouldnt want to either in the equatorial heat of Singapore. Here's some advice: its going to be hot, so take a hat, sunscreen and water. There are actually plenty of water points throughout the park too.The biggest issue here is that nothing comes cheap - and that includes the wait times for the rides. The rides themselves are really good. Even the ""lame"" ones for the kiddies, such as the Madagascar ride, are well done. And its a blessed relief to finally sit down in the airconditioning. Thre more popular rides can have long waits - when we were the the other day they stretched out to well over an hour. You can get a fast pass, buts its not cheap and there is no family option. So, for an unlimited fast pass for a family of four - again, no kids' discounts - its $80 Singapore dollars each. And thats on top of the entrance fee! Mind you, the few people we saw using the pass did go straight to the top of the queue. If you are really time poor, but not otherwise poor, then the fast pass is for you. The rest of us just wait. And this is where it also gets itneresting: to pass the time I checked out these waiting areas pretty thoroughly. Although most of them seem to have airconditioning in place, it doesnt seem to be turned on until you get very close to the start of the ride...why? Are they that cheap that they cant afford to keep the masses cool in the heat of the day? And while we're about it, why do you have to pay for locker hire? On the Egyptian ride, if your locker goes over 40 minutes, the meter starts running!! GIven the length of the queue, this is a pretty fair bet!And if you want to buy a water bottle with a fan that sprays your face to keep you cool, expect to pay around $20.We thought the best rides were the Transformers Ride and the Curse of the Mummy. Both were very popular but had the ""wow"" factor. The roller coasters were good, but were really just roller coasters! Young children will like the Far Far Away section and the Shrek ""ride"" is pretty good actually.So, overall, despite the negatives, its a very enjoyable day if you come prepared for the queues. Get in early before the crowds really get going. The people who run USS (as they call it) probably need to rethink their customer strategies a little. They probably dont care though, as the park seems to be packed!

The set-up was really cool especially the Mummy, Transformers, and Fast and Furious.They also have cool souvenirs and a cute very 70's diner where you can eat and take a rest with all the walking.I enjoyed watching their Waterworld Show.

Major attractions I did were the transformers, mummy, jurassic park tree top ride, waterworld and the castle from shrek. Recommend it to anyone going to singapore for a few days. You can buy ponchos at the water rides but we took our own. The rollercoaster ride was closed. To fully enjoy and see all the attractions will need a full day. There are plenty of places to get ice cream and snacks to keep cool. We had lunch which cost us about SGD$14 per meal. We caught the train to sentosa isl and walked across using the long foot bridge.

The Battlestar Galactica is one of the most popular ride here, and you have to queue for at least an hour for that. If you are lucky, you can take a photo with Optimus Prime here.Ancient Egypt - My favorite zone in USS! They really know how to bring back the ancient Egypt environment. There are many giant Egypt statues, and take photos with them will make you realize how small you are. I am lucky to meet Army of Anubis when i walked to this zone. The photo result is so cool. Please don't try Treasure Hunters, except you bring toddler with you. It's just 15 minutes ride but we have to queue for 70 minutes. The ride is super simple, 4 ppl go into a cart, and then circling to see some ruins.Lost World - we tried several rides here but unfortunately missed the Waterworld show so I am kinda disappointed. Later, we met a Velociraptor called Nikki, the newest Jurassic Park addition.Far Far Away - Watch Shrek and Donkey adventure in 4D Show or ride Puss In Boots’ Giant Journey coaster. For meet & greet, you can take photo with Princess Fiona and Shrek.Madagascar - At first, A Crate Adventure seems like just for children but actually it's nice for adults as well. Be prepare for its little surprise inside.Some tips:- Come around 9 am so you can take pictures around Sentosa before you enter USS (it opens at 10 am). Or if you are kind of late, take the rides first and photo later.- Have your lunch before noon so you don't have to jostle around.- Choose outfit that make you comfortable walking for all day long (casual & light t-shirt would be perfect).- Bring hat, umbrella and sunglasses.- Bring water bottle because you will need to drink after several attractions.- You will do queue much, so it's good idea if you bring books with you so you can entertain yourself while standing in line.

review_284039399,“Express Pass – Misleading Advertising”,"Beware of the misleading ticketing information on the rwsentosa/universal website. We bought our 1-day ticket online but decided to buy the Express upgrade (‘$30’ on the website) after we arrived and assess the queues. Arriving at the guest counter, we were then told the Express pass was $50 –not, $30. The clerk said the website states “from” $30 – and that was only for some sort of cardholder. Later I checked – and this “cardholder only” information is not stated anywhere on the ticket price page on the site. So we decided to give the Express a miss at the entrance, but after being in the park for quarter of an hour – seeing queues of 60min+ and feeling the heat – we decided to bit the bullet and buy the Express from one of the ride counters. We were shocked to then be told the Express was now $60 – because the $50 had sold out (somehow in the last 15 minutes). We speculated that the price of Express tickets rose on demand? Yes, finally we bought those $60 upgrades and no concessions for children. A very sour upgrade after the initial impression that it should have been half that price.Was it worth it? We visited on a Monday, school day (Singapore school holidays were over) – and most rides had about 60min wait (more for popular rides). We were told it was an ‘average’ day, so we dread to think what a holiday or weekend would be like. The Express let us do every ride before close-time. We calculate that if you didn’t have an Express – you would probably only manage about 5-6 rides (i.e. you’d spend around 6hours solid in queueing -- the park closes at 7pm). Tip: You should carefully research which rides you want before coming because some only lasted 30-45seconds -- after 60min queuing. The only other solution to avoid the Express price was to enter as –‘Single Riders’ (your group gets split up as they fill the leftover seats) – there’s a few rides like this, and those queues are about the same as Express.Despite the above - I definitely would recommend only going to Universal if you buy an Express upgrade -- especially if you have children who would find hours of queuing in the heat impossible. In other words, accept that it will be a very expensive day, and don’t compare it what you get with other theme parks around the world.

The only bad thing is it'll be a bad experience if u go on weekends or during vacation time for the Singaporean kids... When we had been thr it was quite rush... For each ride minimum 20 mins u have to wait if it's not rushy Max 10 mins... The must try rides are transformers,revenge of mummy, human and cyclone... If it's rushy and ur running out of time avoid far far away and Madagascar because both are for kids.. And I would like to suggest to keep the jurrasic park ride at the end cuz ull definitely get wet if u don't wear a rain coat... And if lucky stay till 5 if the parade is thr cuz it's really good...

review_283823814,“good fun for the family.”,"Though expensive, It is good fun. One can spend the full day here. It is a must to get an express pass a tS$ 50/ 70, so that youu dont spend the whole day waiting in ques. This was probably the most worthwhile S$50 per head we spent. youngters would enjoy the high speed roller coasters. For the full family, the gentler rides like Madagascar, Jurrasic ride, water world are very enjoyable. The 4 D shekk show was great fun. The best ride I have ever experienced was the 4d transformers ride. Terrific effects made you feel that you were actually there without experiencing any of the dangers of a roller coaster, since it was all virtual.

review_283774586,“Not a Very good Experience”,"Firtsly I know that I went at probably the busiest time of the year, end of school holidays on a Sunday so was expecting long queues and had already prepared my daughter with the we have to wait and queue and be patient etc.Got there as the park was opening to try and maximize our time in the park and at least go on the rides she had set her heart on.First up was Transformers & I know this is the most popular ride here, so a queue time of approx. 50 minutes at the start of the morning was a bit of a shock, but we decided to queue. A 50 minute wait time was closer to 70 minutes, with VIP’s more about that later. The ride itself was one of the best I had been on in a long time & my 9 year old loved it.Next up was Roller coaster “Human” I think it’s called. Please deposit all bags in lockers provided. After several attempts at finding an empty locker we then find out that the fingerprint reader was struggling, ended up using a pin password, much simpler & quicker. Free locker for 90 minutes. No phones or water or wallet. Just inside & my daughter wanted a drink of water. There are a few water stations located inside whilst queuing. Again this was 50 minute wait time or so it said. After 1 hour we were finally near the front to see what caused such a long delay. I understand that people don’t like queuing so VIP passes despite been expensive can be good. But as my daughter pointed out, a carriage arrived with 18 seats (I think) and 18 VIPs got in. Next carriage arrives and we are thinking we can get on this one. How wrong I was, by the time the VIPs had got on 3 spare seats for the ordinary people. Next car we must get on, but wrong again. That’s when my daughter said she thought she had seen the same family get on the ride 3 times whilst we had been queuing. If that is the case then it’s totally bad management. Surely VIP’s who can walk to the front of any queue should then have to wait a minimum of 30 minutes before re-entering if the queue time is 60 minutes. Its not like they can’t do anything else, just walk to the front of another queue. If that was put in place then a lot of other people could then enjoy the park & go on the rides.Free lockers are available, but then on the next ride had to pay? Why. Any other theme park I have been to they have a storage area near the boarding place where you can leave your bag. Just get the feeling that its there to maximize the amount of money they can make. Paid for 1 locker 1 hour $2 and again queued. This time we were longer that 1 hour. To open the locker you need to insert more money or credit card. Guess where the credit card / wallet is inside the locker. Now we have to find a locker guy to pay to open it, so that we can then pay him back. Poor really.Arrived just after 10:00 & got on the last ride are 19:15, so a good 9 hours. In that time we achieved 4 rollercoasters & the rapids. Like I said at the beginning I knew it was going to be busy, but 5 rides in a full day does not give me value for money, and the experience with VIPs getting multiple turns on the same rides left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.The park is spotlessly clean like everywhere else in Singapore, plenty of food & beverage places which were reasonable, by Singapore prices

review_283763487,“Fun filled place”,"As the name implies. This place was designed for family and kids.The only cons about this place is the limited number of attractions and the ride times. Some of the attraction could use some updating.- Waterworld - erm. nice but its quite a forgettable movie, so I doubt many people would care about this- The mummy - it's been years since the last one. I'm not sure if it's still relevant- Transformers - This is still fresh on everyone's minds and there's also the cartoons- Jurassic Park - with Jurassic world now out in the theaters, they could definitely renovate and update this ride to make it much more exciting.- Battlestar Galatica - It was closed at the time I was there so no comments can be made. However, the TV show has been over for awhile now... might be relevant to convert it as something else.- Sesame Street - Definitely needs more shows and musicals, this is one of the star attractions!

Here's a suggested route for groups without small children and looking for thrills: Far Far Away roller coaster - Revenge of the mummy - Battlestar galactica human - battlestar galactica cylon - Transformers - The waterworld show. Other rides are mostly for small children. CAUTION: Even on a weekday, going early, we had to spend hours queuing up for the rides. If you go on weekends, you are likely to run out of time before trying all the rides I mentioned.

review_283754244,“Express pass = no lines (but high cost)”,"We have been to the Universal in Osaka, Japan and our main complaint was the long lines. This time we forked over the big bucks and got the unlimited express pass. Boy, did that change our opinion of Universal. Yes, it was expensive (very much so) but we were allowed entry to the park first and didn't wait in a single line. We were able to ride transformers and puss in boots over 5 times each.My main critique are the shows. Well, not the shows themselves, because they are well done. But, the process of getting into a show. For instance, the 4D Shrek movie which should only be 20 minutes long, you wait in an entry theater and watch a preshow for 15 minutes. Same with donkey live. I guess I compare it to Disney that once you get into a show, the show should begin, you should not be put through another waiting process masked by a few ""instructions"" or jokes.My kids are also finally tall enough to do all the rides except Galactica but as a warning to parents of small children, check their height to see if the park is right for you. My daughter is 103 and my son 115 so they had to have an adult with them on all rides but even the Elmo spaghetti chase had a height limit. They also do not do parades on weekdays which is unfortunate. My kids are huge fans of Dreamworks characters and again, maybe I'm unfairly comparing to Disney. We would have loved a parade with the penguins of madagascar, Puss in boots, dinosaurs, transformers etc. The tickets aren't cheaper during the week, but you do miss out on the parade.The character meet and greets are not as busy as Disney parks though. We got pictures with Optimus Prime and Bumblebee which were highlights in my son's day.

We had paid for the universal express ticket online when we bought the tickets and used this to its full advantage even doing some of the rides twice with and without the express pass. The park is spotlessly clean and as you would expect from a large named theme park the facilities are very good. Food is available whether it be fast food or popcorn kiosks and the price is normal theme park prices. It's not as big as the USA ones but we had a brilliant day out, on the Battlestar Galatica ride the 'cyclone' wins hand down.

review_283722888,“Fun - would be a 4 if we had express pass”,"We visited here on what felt like our hottest day in Singapore yet with our 2 children (7 & 5).We didn't get to the park until 12 as we did the indoor skydiving first. My biggest advise is to take frozen water for everyone in the family as it will melt quickly and you will need a lot of it. Secondly buy an express pass. We didn't and due to this we only managed to go on three rides as waiting in queues for 60-70 minutes with you children is not fun.If you go without children and don't mind going on a ride without your friends then go in the single line queue, in most cases you will go to the front of the line.Food is massively overpriced so try to take some of your own.Now for the good stuff, the rides we did go on we're awesome, Transformers , Jurassic water ride & The Madagascar water ride. The kids loved the Madagascar ride even if it was a little tame for us. This is one ride we didn't have to queue for too long for.Staff were super friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. We will go back one day but will buy express pass in advance so that we do t notice the cost as much.One further tip, take a hand held fan ( can buy cheap from Chinatown) will help on the very hot days and in queues

We experienced Transformers 4D, The Mummy ride, someother rolercoaster and the Battle star galactica ride twice. Great rides. These rides, before getting in the que lines have a free 45 min locker service, they dont let u take anything with you due to the speed of the rides. So place your personals in their lockers before you line up.Entry fee not cheap at $74.00pp, considering the wait times but then they have an express pass at $70.00pp on top of the entry fee not to mentione food (obviously optional).

We went in, thinking that we did not need to wait for long. However, when we were about to board, the personnel decided to ""Add another Cylon Raider into the battle"". Which basically meant the were adding another train. The process took 30 mins! We finally got on and, I have to admit, it was awesome, better than the previous version. Then, we went to the Pizza diner and ordered 3 slices of Pizza and a plate of Spagetti and Meatballs. It had cost us $57! Subsequently, we went to other rides in the park. Queue times were excruciatingly long! 80 mins for the Jurrasic Park water ride! Then we went to the new Puss in Boots ride. 15 min queue time was ok, by the theme parks standards. I would recommend you give it a miss unless you have young children or you are an avid Puss in Boots fan. Not very interesting. The staff there were frowning, making the atmosphere quite sad.

If you want to skip the queues, you have to pay additional for the express pass which was too exorbitant. Feels like a massive rip off compared to other theme parks with free fast passes.Every ride was an least an hour long. We had to keep our belongings in the locker so we couldn't use our phones throughout the 100 minute wait on Battlestar Galactica. It would be better if shelves are provided beside the rollercoaster for you to stash your bags & not just your shoes so we can at least use our phones whilst waiting. Had to store our bags in lockers on the Mummy Ride and it was a nightmare as everyone was crowding around and there was no space to move. It was also very troublesome to store bags in the locker again and again.It was indeed a disappointment compared to other Universal Studios like Florida & Osaka. I left after taking just 2 rides and half the day was already gone due to the long waiting hours.

They have a service for you to pick up all your shopping at the end of the day.You will need an entire day to really enjoy the park. Even then, you may not be able to complete all the rides.

review_282569607,“Sentosa Island”,"This is quite a long and tiring day, much of it in sweltering tropical heat, but its so worth it.First up, our coach took us to the cable car site where we took a cable car over the water to Sentosa Island. Looking down from the car onto the deck of a cruis e ship, and over cranes, roof tops, and housing developments. We hada lot to cover this day from watching th amazing pink Dolphins performing tricks, to a 4 D experience for which you wore special 3 d glasses, to the waxworks,{Madame Tussauds}. The highlight for me was the amazing sound and light experience on the Waterfront,called,""The Wings of Time"".Quiea few young children, lots of crowds. The children were amazingly well behaved as it was very hot ,and tiring with a lot of walking.Was it worth it? Yes, I think so, but be prepared, take water, sunglasses,wet wipes, a sun hat, and a cotton top with sleeves,and comfy shoes or sandals.

That being said , Universal studios was fun, surprisingly. Best ride was the transformers and the mummy. And clicking pics with Minion was an amazing experience. Wish battlestar galactica was open. They were test riding it. The queues are insanely long. So my tip is to use the single person queue. That's how my sister and I covered all the rides. Cons - The live shows were lifeless ,

review_282215531,“Universal Studios Singapore”,"Let the kid out in you! You wouldn't visit Singapore without visiting a day in Universal Studios (USS). Tickets can be bought on Sentosa or online. It is cheaper if bought online (http://m.rwsentosa.com/Home/HotDeals) at around S$68 compared to original cost at S$74. That S$68 ticket already includes one-day pass, free meal and special gift! We didn't purchase our tickets online because we wanted to ride the cable cars. We got our tickets for S$100. Regular tickets for the cable cars cost S$29. At S$100, we were able to save just S$3. Still it was cheaper if the day pass for USS is bought online.Best attraction: Battlestar Galactica as Cylons. Although I already freaked out as Humans. It was so much fun! Don't ever forget Transformers. The line may be long, but it was so amazing! It was worth it!

review_282016111,“Clever venue”,"Headed back here again today for the 3rd time since 2002.Always a good fun place to visit to escape from the real world for a while.Lots of people here today. We arrived around 10.30 & left by 3.30pm.Didn't get to do many rides today being so busy. The 1st time we did the Transformers ride today. It had the usual warnings of, ""Don't ride if you suffer from this, that, motion sickness etc."" I though that it couldn't be too bad as the Madagascar ride had the same warnings. Well, I do suffer from motion sickness from time to time but thought I'd give this a go. Well, I got half way into it & then I started feeling a bit off - doh! The last part felt like half an hour when in actual fact it probably only was 2 minutes... For me...next time heed the warnings!! All in all it's a great place to visit. Over the years they have slowly changed things here & it's good to see fresh things.From booking through our travel agent (Phil Hoffmann Travel) the entry fee was $78 each for the basic booking less 2 vouchers included. 1 for $5 discount on food & 1 for $5 off any merchandise purchase over $35. The only downer for the day was that it was quite still & humid in the afternoon & it felt quite hot. Remember to drink plenty, dress lightly & sunscreen is a must for when you are travelling between sites of interest.Enjoy!PS: the cakes at Starbucks are yummy

If you want to go for USS for a nostalgic trip down childhood memory, look somewhere else, this is not the place. There are sufficient rides for teens - adults, but as expected the queue is ridiculous. My advice? Get an unlimited express pass. The weather in Singapore is humid and extremely hot. It gets stuffy even though some queue lines are equipped with fans.

Will share the following which we learnt:1) Take the show timing brochure on entry and Time your rides as per the show timings.2) Must reach there by 10:30.3) Best rides are the New Roller coaster, Transformers, Mummy Roller coaster, Jurasic Park water ride( don't waste your money on Plastic covers). Best show is the underwater world.4) Try and buy the tickets online.5) Avoid weekends to avoid serpentine lines.

We actually live very close to 3 theme parks on the Gold Coast, Australia, but thought this may still be worth a visit. And it was. We just caught a taxi from our hotel straight there, and had pre-purchased tickets to collect on the day.

Absolutely highly recommend the transformers ride, the best I have been on by a long shot. I couldn't really fault this park.

Though Singapore's is a smaller version, it still lived up to what I had in mind. The attractions are great, the performances amazing and the total experience very fun. This is one place one should not miss going to when in Singapore -- it's simply full of surprises. (Get a map and schedule of performances so you can maximize your visit and catch the must-sees. This organizes your travel path and lets you plan where to go next. Chances are there are too many people around and lines are long, so you'd want to know which ones are worth waiting for.)I could keep coming back here and not get tired.

The queues were massive and it took around half an hour to get on most rides, many of which only lasted for a couple of minutes. Many of the rides were really just for children, such as Madagascar and Puss in Boots. The two Jurassic Park rides were good, and the Shrek 4D show was entertaining. However, the only really exciting looking ride, the Transformers roller coaster, was closed on the day we visited. The entry fee was really too high for what you got.

This was a great idea and you could still go on a rainy day but I wouldn't.Paying at the hotel was a good idea to as they had no queues and because its all part of Resort World we only paid $64 each.I believe this is a $10 discount each.All the hotels in the RWSentosa chain will do the same.We did the 4 photo package that started at Madagascar and cost $50 for the 4 different photo stops.Madagascar / Puss In Boots / Transformers and Sesame Street. (1 at Each)Make sure you stay till dark as it looks great all lit up.You can leave and come back in and I would suggest this is a good idea as the food shops outside of USS in The Forum are better and cheaper.Just make sure you keep your ticket and get stamped for re-entry.Make sure you keep a look out for Lights Camera Action as It didn't look much from the outside but it is a movie set in a boat shed as a storm hits.The shed starts to shake as the winds increase, then the water starts to catch on fire as all the windows smash out of the walls, then a large ship smashes in thru the side doors of the room and caves in the roof which falls and splashes water every where.Well worth the look. Staying all day is good to as some of the rides had a 60 minute wait time early in the day so we just kept walking and the next time we went past the wait time may be under 20 minutes now.

The only let down ride was the mummy returns as it was a very long wait and really disappointing as rather tame. Very reasonable for price and located superbly.

We were only told this upon joining the queue that we have to go all the way back outside to store our bags. Wish there were better signage that tells us that Sooner. It wasn't a short walk either.Lucky it wasn't busy despite it being the middle of June.The rides and the lost world show were amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed our day at universal studio. The tickets were expensive for such a small park but we managed to buy discounted tickets which included a meal and a free gift. That was a very good online deal but you can only use Singapore IP to buy the tickets online even though not restricted to only Singapore residents. I'd advise to just check online before you go and see if there are and deals when you visit. You can probably buy the tickets online when you are at the hotel and ask the front desk staff to help you print the tickets.

I went with my college mates during our semester break which thankfully didn't fall during the Malaysian and Singaporean school holidays so for the most part we didn't spend more than 5-10 minutes queuing for rides (wait time can be up 2 hours during peak so be sure to plan a day, best be a week day and not during any holidays) and we could even go on the rides multiple times. The Singapore weather for the most part is sunny but you should check the weather forecast as a precaution. Overall it was worth every penny! The food outlets are abundant and vary according to the theme of the area you're in and covers a vast variety of cuisines but be prepared to spend at least $20 per person on food and drinks because you're bound to get thirsty and hungry throughout the day and the food and drinks are really nice and tempting with the heat! Especially their slushies and juices. As for the souvenirs, some of them are worth the money and others are in my opinion ridiculously priced so bring a little extra cash for that. Overall it's an excellent theme park, ammenities are well maintain, food and beverages are not too pricey and the rides are fantastic especially for those who love some thrill.

review_280860171,“Tips to enhance your enjoyment at Universal Studios...”,"Major theme parks' entry fees are not cheap. Universal Studios here is no different. So be prepared to spend a fullday here if you want to enjoy fully & get your money's worth. As with all major theme parks, it is usually very crowded and quite normal to wait pretty long just to get into a ride. Especially the very popular ones.Few things to note to enhance enjoyment of your visit here.1. Universal Studios is part of Resorts World Sentosa. It is located at Sentosa Island. Nearest MRT station is Harbour Front ( via North East Line or Circle Line).From here you need to take either the Monorail, Bus or Cablecar into Sentosa. Recommend to take Monorail as cheap, comfortable & more convenient.2. As weather here is hot & humid all year round, wear cool casual clothes. Come in shorts or bermudas & wear cool, non-cotton T-shirts.3. Food & drinks are expensive here - as at any Attractions. And in this hot weather, chances are you will need to drink/eat more than usual, especially when you are spending whole day here. Buy enough drinks & sandwiches/snacks at the huge Giant supermarket at Vivo City mall or food from any of the food outlets.4. Avoid coming here on weekends as it is much more crowded than weekdays. Besides tourists, many locals families come here on weekends. Same everywhere in the world. 5. Certain organisations hold 'Family Day Outing' events here for staff & family. Some of these companies have many hundreds of people involved. Avoid going on such days if possible. Not sure if can check this out online before booking tickets.6. Check Resorts World Singapore website for promotions. Occassionally they do have special packages which saves you alot of money as compared to buying tickets on site. Especially when there are more people going.Definitely this is a must visit attraction in Singapore. Especially if you have kids. They will love it.

review_280603037,“Worth the time spent”,"This is a world in itself! But, make sure you're early, else you might be strangling for tickets. Do not miss the SEA Aquarium at any cost, it's the star attraction in Sentosa!! An underwater experience you would not forget. I recommend iFly for all those who haven't tasted the experience of skydiving; although a bit costly for a one time experience, you would relish it. But, make sure you book you slot atleast a few hours in advance, and look out for lesser prices on some particular days. If i can recollect, I had been there on a Wednesday and the prices were lower than those on other days. At Universal Studios, the Transformers ride is a must-do! It's an out-of-the-world experience in 4D, for which you might have to toil in the queue for a very long time because it's the most demanded ride in there. Rest, walk around, stop over to have some good food and enjoy! You would easily need 3-4 days to make sure you cover the most of Sentosa.

Queues were still short. The rides here will require you to leave all your belongings at the nearby lockers FREE for the first 45 minutes. After which you will be charge starting at S$2 per how many minutes, can't remember. If the cues are long, chances are you will end up paying the lockers. So do take this 3 at just opening time where queues are still short. Then you decide if you want to continue to ride at Jurrasic Park (wet ride), Puss in Boots (not so thrilling), Madagascar (like a kid ride). Then go picture taking, shopping, movies. No need for express pass!

Since we have impatient children we all got express passes and we were glad we did! We had negligible waiting time at the rides which allowed us to enjoy the park thoroughly. We went in May and I can only imagine how even more handy the express pass would be during peak seasons! Didn't enjoy the new puss in boots ride so much (fortunately we didn't wait long thanks to the express pass, otherwise I would have felt it was waste of time!). We regrettably didn't get to ride the Star Trek roller coasters which opened a few weeks later (darn)!

I recommend vip pass (or whatever it's name is) for family with kids as it can save a lot of time and cut the queue. Bring your own bottle of water as there will be water cooler everywhere. Consider using the locker if u plan to go up rides with water (especially Dino something - forgot its name again). It cost 20$ not mistaken for a day (not quite sure of the price). People who do not like roller coaster / old people : i recommend not going up the Mummy roller coaster. It is a hell of a ride! . Ps : believe me it's a must try. And it's worth the money!!

Although I'm in my 50's we decided to give the place a go and so glad we did. I came out feeling like a 20 year old again!! There's so much to see and do but it's difficult to get around and enjoy everything if you only have a one day ticket due to opening and closing times. There are queues for the rides as you'd expect but they tended to go down a bit faster than the timing boards stated. Not that keen on Singapore as a destination but if I'm going through Singapore again I'd go back to this place.

review_280163661,“Awesome!”,"We went because of the PSA family day,and it was great.The children wanted to ride the Enchanted Airways(?).They thought it'd be a nice,relaxing ride,but the moment it ended my 7-year-old was traumatized.We barely met any characters,because it was in the late evening.Food was expensively delicious.Churros?I won't really recommend it,it's not the best.I got dizzy after eating a churro.The rides I recommend for young children aged 1-12 :-The merry-go-round near the snack shack-Bounty Hunters-Madagascars Boat Ride-Transformers the Ride-The Crate Adventure (Madagascars)For teenagers aged 13-20 and seeking thrill and excitement:-Battlestar Galactica *Cylon goes upside down, human goes a little faster than Cylon. -Revenge of The Mummy-Jurassic ParkFor adults aged 21-35,I think it would be the same as the teenagers.For seniors aged 36+,I do NOT recommend incredibly fast rides.There are warning signs telling you what to expect,so do read them before riding.Those were just rides.I didn't see ALL the shows,but if you're gonna watch Waterworld,don't sit in the front row unless you wanna get soaked.And if you dislike loud noises,sit further from the acting area.

review_280155218,“Nice park with great set design and visually appealing - but lacking rides”,"We where prepared for Universal in Singapore to be smaller than its counterpart in Florida, but it is still surprising how small and contained it is, with a limited amount of rides. I think for younger children this park would be fantastic, but as a couple that enjoy thrill rides its average. When we visited in May it was extremely hot and the wait time for rides very long - so we didn't actually go on many, and sadly the most exciting looking ride was out of action for the day. We did think that visually the park was fantastic, the set design and effort that has gone into designing it is really good, better than Florida. And we enjoyed walking around and taking it all in - but if return to Singapore I very much doubt we would visit again unless they open more thrill rides.

review_280117227,“Must go to when in Singapore!”,"Amazingly great experience I had when we visited towards end of May. It was worth the stay. You must have an enormous energy from morning till evening to enjoy everything. I love the Mummy ride, Jurassic Park, Transformer, Shrek and the Waterworld. What I like about it (esp the Mummy and Transformer) is that they are able to merge technologies and the rides became a 3D experience. I had so much fun I have to update my membership to 6months by addiing 30sgd. You can also have a picture of Marilyn, Sesame Street characters and a whole lot more. Get ready to be wet in Jurassic Park ride and Waterworld show. The park is best enjoyed with special pass that allows fast track no waiting required as you will have a dedicated queue. I heard its twice the price but I'm sure its worth it. HIghly recommended to kids and kids at heart.

The park itself was relatively quiet on the day we visited, but we still purchased the express tickets for an extra $60 and the passes were well worth the extra money spent. The highlight of the day was the transformers ride... an ultimate 4D simulation ride that made me feel like I was actually in a Transformers movie. This was a new ride experience for me and I hope Movies Theatres go this way in the future with making movies because it was great.

review_279856786,“Nice but very small and no exciting rides”,"This review might be a bit biased as I frequently visit Universal Orlando. I will try not to compare the two parks and review this park as a separate entity. Reaching the park from the taxi stand took a very long walk. You had to go through a huge casino and then a huge outdoor area until you reached the universal city walk area. Then you had to cross that to reach to the ticket booth and into the park. Now we had a hard time with that as we were a family pushing a baby in a stroller while it was pouring rain. When we finally arrived, we noticed that the park was a but on the smaller side. A major let down was that there was absolutely nothing for little kids. Our daughter ended up just staying outside while we swapped during the whole time we were in the park. The only ride she was allowed in was the Shrek 3D which was not so much fun for her. The food was very expensive and mediocre. The themeing of the park was good and it was a pleasant walk around the park, but before we knew it, we had already finished the park. Would definitely recommend this place for older kids but not for families with small kids.

review_279823635,“Fun times!!”,"My husband and I visited during the school holidays and whilst that normally is my worst nightmare it really didn't effect me at all; mainly because we had the express pass for all rides. The pass is well worth the money. While some waited 70 minutes for a ride the most we waited was 10 minutes and that was only because they introduced a new carriage to the most popular ride to reduce the waiting time. My husband cleverly bought tickets online (when in Singapore) which gave us the option of buying a package that included discounted entry ticket, voucher for lunch and a free gift. The trick was buying it in Singapore - outside of SGP means you don't get the deal. We really enjoyed the rides but I also loved the Waterworld show (bit cheesy but that is to be expected) and Lights, Camera, Action. I wouldn't recommend for those looking for a cultural experience but those looking for fun!

The roller coasters, apart from the Galatic Express, are pretty slow and not as thrilling as you would find in other parks, say Thorpe Park. The Galatic Express is fast and has its fair share of turns and dips and is quite zippy but lacks the punch you would expect of the fastest roller coaster. The Egyptian roller coaster is quite different and fun though. So is the Transformers ride, nice and different. A half day outing, since you can easily cover the rides and attractions within 4 hours at a comfortable pace. Make more time if you want to attend the shows!

review_279170774,“A Fun-Filled Day for Tourists and Families”,"One (or a group) can easily spend a day full of fun in USS. There are lots of positive reviews around on the rides, etc. so I'll skip to the tips:* Grab the show timings flier after the entrance so you don't miss the different shows.* Check the weather. Open rides are usually closed on rainy hours. Hot sunny days can get, well, really hot especially at noon and mid-day.* If going on the weekend or public holidays, it's most probably going to be crowded, so get there early in the day! Be also prepared to see queue times of 45mins to 120mins (yes, you read that right, I've seen it) on the displays outside the rides.* Check the online website (hey Google) beforehand if you have the time, to check for current events, scheduling, as well as any possible online deals.* The USS pass (similar to some other Sentosa passes) is a day pass. Meaning that you can go out of the park and return later, but only during the same day.* Check the weather beforehand! (Did I mention...the weather?!)

The studio has been divided into (1) HollywoodNothing much to see here, just shops and restaurant, along the way you might see some movie characters, see your time table for details, it has only 1 attraction here - Sesame Street Show - it is only for children age 3-12, not so encouraging to see for adult.(2) New YorkThere are 2 attraction here(a) Lights, Camera, Actions - Very good, suitable for age 7- Adult.(b) Sesame Street Spaghetti space chase - Suitable for age 3-12(3) Sci-fi City(a) Transformer - MUST VISIT - Suitable for age 7- Adult.(b) Battlestars - For adult only if you are very adventurous...(c) Acceleletor - Spin and Spin in a big cup, not encourage because can get vomit easily.Hint: Mind you there will be one big giant size Optimus Prime walking around and you can take photo with him, very impressive, check your listing for the time.(4) Ancient Egypt2 Rides here...(a) Treasure Hunters - for Children 3-10 years old, Boring for adult.(b) Revenge of the mummy - MUST RIDE, roller coaster get into the dark, suitable for age 8 to adult(5) The Lost world4 rides and a show(a) Canopy flyer - Not bad, suitable for age 7 to adult, but tips for you must sit on the forward chairs but not back wards chairs.(b) Dino Soarin - For age 3-10, nothing so special(c) Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure - Not bad, suitable for age 7- Adult, I personally think that the one in USA is better, Singapore version is not as excited as the one in California.(d) Amber Rock Climb - Need to pay extra, never tried.Show - Water world - I have seen it every time I visit Universal Studio, it has been the same over the years, it has been kind of boring for me now, but strongly encourage for the first timer. Check your listing for time. (6) Far Far awayUp to this point, you almost finished, there are 5 attractions here(a) Puss in boots - Giant Journey - It is very new when I visit, fun, very good for age 7 to adult, my daughter (10 years old) loves this.(b) Donkey Live - EXCELLENT, very funny, suitable for age 3 to adult, you can actually interact with the carton on the screen.MUST VISIT(c) Magic potion spin - Only for children age 3-7(d) Shrek 4D Adventure - MUST SEE, very good, suitable for age 7- Adult.(e) Enchanted airways - Junior version of roller Caster, suitable for age 5-12(7) MadagascarLast one, only have 2 rides,,,(a) King Julien's beach part go-round - For children age 3-7 (b) Madagascar - A crate adventure - River boat ride, nothing special, unless you love the movie Madagascar.HINT: There is a dancing show featuring the theme ""I like to move it move it"", excellent to watch, check listing for time.Overall the experience is very good, although I like Hong Kong Disneyland better especially visiting during winter time.TIPS: (1) Get a priority pass for S70 per person, worth it, it save you a lot of time and you sure can finish all the rides.(2) Bring an umbrella, it will be very useful if the sun is too strong or raining.(3) Do not carry too many thing into the studio, a handy back pac is recommended for a small family.(4) Must try pop corn.

Everything was lovely till we experienced the roller coaster ride in the eygpt section - Revenge of the Mummies. It is an indoor dark ride. Whilst we were on the roller coaster, there was some technical snag and the ride stopped midway. I have no clue if there were any casaulties but to narrate my experience.The ride stopped, it was pitch dark with no announcement. After some time, a recorded voice requests us to remain seated....some lights turn on but no intimation of whats happening. we were at a level where there were narrow pathways on either side (i guess it was towards the end of the ride). We could see one of the universal employees far off...we called out to him but he just turned and walked away. There were 12 of us in the carriage. It was only after a lot of screaming and yelling for help (about 30 mins) that a lady came to inform that the ride was defunct and we would be assisted. Help arrived after a total of around 45 mins. The sad part is that a company and a country of such repute, did not find it necessary to send someone immediately to calm nervousness and provide information. They were not even apologetic about it. It seems that by providing a express pass, there is redemption for them. (which is of no use since there were only 10 mins before all rides shut down for the day. Apparently IT HAPPENS FREQUENTLY WITH THIS RIDE, as disclosed by one of the employees there. I dread to think what would be the scenario if it would have stopped at some other twister level.So use your judgement and be careful before venturing on this ride

A full day is required to properly visit the different attractions. One may have to wait in line for the rides as there are many visitors but its a worth the wait.

review_278506230,“Best place for kids and adults ”,"It was my 2nd visit and first with my family. We choose to go to Singapore because it has so many places for kids. Universal studio is the best place for kids 1. There are so many musical shows like shrek, when I go grow up, water event event to name a few which kids will love2. There are small rides in far far away which is amazing 3. My wife lived the transformer ride and water ride 4. There was a roller coaster ride in complete darkness which fascinating. I think they have added recently 5. We thought of taking express ticket but that is worth. You alternatively do kids ride in morning and try transformer rides in evening where find relatively less queues . In that way you avoid express tickets, but it's risk. 2 times it did work You will love this and want to come back and again. Reach sharply on time. There is much to see

review_278503084,"“Pricey, not better than Disneyland, Avg rides, Transformer show the best”","Frankly, I feel Universal Studios SG is a bit overrated like some other attractions in SG. Sure it depends if you've been to other theme parks like Disneyland or Ocean Park in Hong Kong or Dreamworld in Bangkok or not as its no better than either of them. The only show different and thoroughly enjoyable is the Transformers 3D show, in the Sci-Fi City Section but be prepared to stand atleast 1.5 hrs in queue during mid day timings. Still its worth it. The rest of the rides are pretty average, nothing enjoyable, some rides are even waste of time.The Egyptian dark ride was great too.What I didn't like about was that the main Roller coaster was offline and even the Jurrasic park ride was closed, that's not acceptable if you are taking the full ticket price. If the rides are permanently closed for maintenance, there should be some refund of money or atleast a little lesser charge.The far far fly show was horribly long, boring and waste of time. Hollywood section is the same boredom.Lights, Camera, Action!™ Hosted by Steven Spielberg is a good show in New york Section. Fast & Furious 7 Dance show was good too. When I Grow Up was boring, everyone tends to leave it midway, so did we!The Madagascar section is all useless and pretty much basic for any amusement park, I don't expect I paid in the name of USS for such basic rides.The food is average too and pricey. The Mango slush at Egypt section was tasty.All in all, it wasn't a very different experience, but the first time theme park visitors who haven't seen Disney or other parks may enjoy it more than who have experienced better parks. The $75 ticket isn't cheap, I'd rather spend time and money on other more enjoyable activities at Sentosa. USS-- Not Value for money! The heat was a bit killing too which hampers the experience too.

review_278397792,“Be ready to...have fun..wear comfy shoes...take lots of photos..”,"This is my second trip to the singapore universal studio. I went in Dec where christmas spirits was in the air. Beautiful decos. Better than this second trip which is just normal. Here's my take on USS1. USS is a great place for kids especially teenagers and adults. Small kids 7 and below would enjoy but not many attractions for them. Your best bet is Madagascar and Mummy's treasure hunters. Rapid river adventure is ok but may scare some of the young ones. Their heights will be measured before they can ride. Elmo spaghetti is a wonderful rides for kids and adults. 2. You can reach by MRT or Cabs or Bus. You need to go to Harbourfront MRT. Then take a monorail to sentosa. Its SGD4 per pax for the monorail return trip. 4. Get there early...they open at 10am. Be there at 930! Take photos whole waiting at the rotating universal globe. 5. Book on line! Trust me! You will be thankful to skip the lines. Don't bother buying at the counter. You will for wait hours. Online purchase will give u a bar code. Bring it straight to the entrance gate. Either print the barcodes or have it ready online. 6. Buy the Express Pass. Trust me on this. You will avoid the loooooog line of the normal lines...my son calls it the ...'Peasants Line'. The Peasants line waiting time can be half hour and more while you whisk by. Slightly longer wait at Weekends and Public Holidays but worth the additional SGD50. But the espress pass is only for one ride. If you want to go for seconds. U will need to join the Peasants line :-). Note: You will need to get the express pass at the customer service counter located on the immediate left after you enter USS. U need the tickets and present it to the staff at each of the attractions.7. Advise...when you enter...go straight to the Transformer ride. The best ride in USS. Normally long wait. You can look at the other attractions later. 8. Mummy's ride...put everything in a locker first. U cant bring bags or anything else. If u have glasses. Hold on it tightly. 9. Cylon and human ride. Put everything in a locker. They have a metal detector! Can't smuggle your phone in !! We tried :-) 10. Bring empty water bottles in. There are water fountain around the park. All near the rest rooms. Another option for those who love sodas. Buy the tumblers which ranges from sgd11 to sgd26. U can top up the sodas for sgd2. Slush at sgd5. I personally like the transformers tumbler and puss in boots :-) . 11. Food is not cheap. Bring your own if possible. The cheapest is chicken rice set at 11.90 per set @ jurassic12. Fireworks is only on Saturday. It's at 8pm. If possible go right in front. There are very low fireworks. You can't see it thru the crowd. 13. Waterworld. .. choose your seats well if you don't want to get wet. Tips...loomk at the benches...14. The gift shops are wonderful. You will be lead to the shops after each rides. There is one in each parks. Look out for promotions. It's all in SGD. 15. Personally if you are with family. I suggest take a cab back. After 1 full day it's worth it. It's only 20 plus SGD to orchard road and you can save your ears with the kids whinning! and complaining! on how tired they are while waiting in line at the monorail and mrt :-) . Another note...save a cab tel no of sgd in your phone Call them. It's only a 7 mins wait. Waiting for a cab can take more than 45mins at peak period. 16. There are lots of walking..wear slippers. Avoid shoes. It can be uncomfortable to walk in a wet socks and shoes after rapid water adventure and waterworld..We love USS...it's fun..will definately go again.....

review_278361562,“A universal and magical experience for young and young at heart”,"The magic of Disney simply explodes from every corner of Universal Studios Singapore! Step into Hollywood sets, and travel along the cobble stoned streets Or in my case danced to the tunes of all the favourite Disney films.This wonderfully created world of amusement rides, and novelty stores selling every possible Disney movies character you could imagine... Is truly a kids wonderland! So the best decision we made prior to arriving at the studios was to purchase your tickets online, very simple but a huge must is to also buy the Express Ticket when booking online! If you can't stand long queues packed with thousand of kids - my worst nightmare right in front of me - you simply take the Express Line and sail right to the beginning of the ride. With so much to see you simply shouldn't waste time waiting and to stand in that ridiculous level of humidity is just insane. And PS.. Wear a hat and most importantly bring sunscreen! I was searching everywhere for the life size Disney characters but alas I could find one to hug!There are rides for all ages and certainly does not disappoint.Universal Studios should be on your to visit list when in Singapore!!

review_278036625,“Good fun but beware of gouging”,"So we went here on a weekday for my daughter's 5th birthday. We tried most of the rides as a family, with the exception of the more intense rides which I had to go on alone. That said, the advantage of going on The Mummy and Transformers alone is that the queue is very short. I didn't try Battlestar Galactica as the queue was too long (circa 60 mins). All the other rides were fine and we didn't really need to pay extra for the express queue. My main complaint here is the poor quality of the food and its relatively high cost. Don't expect anything close to value for money on the food front.

review_277793746,“My 7-year-old thinks it's ok and my 10-year-old thinks it's awesome”,"There are few rides suitable for young kids apart from the mundane carousel/ mini Ferris wheel/ accelerator (tea cups) type rides you can get at a normal carnival or fun fair. The Sesame Street ride is one and the Madagascar boat ride is another.The Sesame Street musical is worth watching for those with young kids but the older ones found it boring.Some interesting street performances like dance and singing. On a weekday there weren't many characters around the park. I think we saw Charlie Chaplin, Frankenstein and Shrek & Fiona in the entire day we were there.Queues were manageable on the weekday but given the tropical weather, a short wait can feel very long in the sun. This is smaller in scale than Disneyland in hongkong so it's really quite manageable by foot. Older kids have a wide selection of roller coaster type rides and feel more engaged.

review_277744967,“Battlestar Galactica!”,"Finally the awesome Battlestar Galactica rollercoasters have reopened. Confession: I have never tried the previous incarnation of the ride so I cannot give a comparison.I went on a Thursday afternoon and the queue is around 60 minutes (for human) and 40 minutes (for cylon).Make sure you store your belongings and empty your pockets at the nearby (free for first 110 mins) lockers (no wallet, no handphone, no sunglasses, no hats, no keys). They will perform airport style patdown prior to the queue to make sure your pockets are empty.I realized part of the long waiting times are due to the stringent safety check (a good thing) and that they need to ensure that both sides (human and cylon) are ready because they will launch simultaneously.They are pretty intense rides. If you are unsure whether you can take the strain, I suggest to go with the human side first. At least you don't get turned upside down 5 times on human side.I cannot walk straight after riding on both rides because my equilibrium is out of whack (I am getting old).USS ride ranking based on intensity:1. Battlestar galactica cylon side2. Battlestar galactica human side3. Mummy the ride4. Dragon airway (it may be small but it pack a decent G-force).5. Puss in the boots ride (too many sudden stops (jam brake) to let the riders enjoy the scenes).6. Canopy flyer (the most intense part is the queue).Transformer the ride is not on the list because I don't considered it as an intense ride BUT it is still one of the BEST ride in USS. (I am kinda bored of it though, its like watching the same movie for way too many times).June is school holiday period in Singapore. If you go down on weekend, be prepared to wait up to 120 mins for most rides. Express pass is your best friend.Have fun!

When we visited two of the main roller coasters weren't in operation which was a shame but the other rides transforms, mummy were good. There isn't anywhere to get anything half healthy to eat fast food only. The signage from the cable car is poor they could do with some more buses to take people to universal. The monorail is cheap to take you over and free to return from the park but there are big queues at closing time. The fireworks are nothing compared to Disney or universal America and I felt they weren't worth the wait. However not want to sound too negative it's a good place to take the kids and would visit again to visit the waterpark and other areas of the island.

review_277478423,“Must Visit for the Transformers”,"Okay so you are in Singapore City and if you are a tourist you have lot and lots of activity to do and perform. We were a group of close to 18 people who traveled to Singapore from Chennai in March of 2012. We already had our tickets picked up from the home stay where we were staying so entry was not a problem. The park caters to all ages from kids to adults. Kids automatically love the place and am sure as Adults to we had a gala time. It had attractions and rides for everyone however all should be prepared to wait for anything between 30 min to an hour for popular rides like Transformers and Roller coaster. I for myself avoided the Egyptian ride and the roller coaster as I have fear of heights and ghosts. Transformers were my favorite and I tried it twice. I also loved the Pinocchio act and one more drama act (I fail to recall though). I also loved the street act and dance performed by trained staff who also allowed the tourist and visitors to participate in various activities. About Universal Studios – The entrance fee is around $70.00; however we got it cheaper as we booked much in advance. Operation hours are from 10:00AM - 7:00PM. And one day is definitely not enough for you to catch up with all the rides. The Park also had lots of retail stores to buy souvenirs from and dining places to eat and I did pick up quite a few of them for friends and families back in India – God I did spend a bomb there. About support and Staff – I do not recollect having any issues or face any challenge as our Group Lead and my Manager Sunil was well versed with everything in Singapore. It was like his second home. All the staff and Park caretakers that I came across were extremely courteous and helpful. About Food and beverages – It has something to suit everyone’s palette no complaints or regrets.

As the day went on the queues for rides gets longer and longer .We went on the Puss in Boots ride for the 2nd time and the queues was past the 1 hr 20 minutes point , with the express pass we only waited around 15 minutes . We found that the Jurasic park ride had some subtle changes to it from when went 3 years ago and is was not as good. The Mummy ride was Brilliant and still very scary .

review_277404278,“Good for the main rides”,"This isn't a cheap day out, but worth doing for a theme park. We went on a Saturday in a public holiday weekend without realising. Firstly, we got there as soon as the park opened, so that was fine. Pre-book a ticket so you don't have to line up twice. Also highly recommend the express passes as early as you can too because it prices throughout the day like a commodity (stock exchange) depending on the amount of people in the park and the demand. We only bought the single-use express as we are usually happy with one ride of each. Skip the photo-taking that everyone else does as soon as they get in. Start straight with the Transformers ride as soon as you get in (the line we were in was only about 15-20mins compared to the 2.5hrs it was at the end of the day when we left), then do Battlestar Galactica (there are two rides on this), Revenge of the Mummy, then the Lost World at Jurassic. this means you head in a line from front to park of the park along one side. The rest of the rides were for younger kids and families. We were told Shrek 4D was good but there were a few lines of chairs that didn't work properly - we were on them - so for us, that ride was very average and they took a very long time to set the storyline at the start. Food and beverages are mediocre in the park and of course have higher mark ups so bring snacks with you, and a bottle to top up water at the fountains.

There was barely a five minute wait to enter the park. I purchased a one day pass (approx. 70SGD) and their express pass (approx 30SGD). Note that there are two types of express passes (optional), the cheaper one (30SGD) let's you use the express line for every ride only once whereas the more expensive express pass has no restrictions. I would recommend purchasing one to avoid the long lines that will gradually build up throughout the day. There are some rides that you will probably only go on once (Shrek 4D movie) so you can just go ahead and use the express pass and cut your wait time in line down. As we got to the park right at opening, we were able to ride the more popular attractions (Transformers, The Mummy, Jurassic Park) without waiting longer than 5 minutes. My favourite ride was The Mummy which is an entertaining roller coaster ride! There is a souvenir store after every attraction for those who want to purchase memorabilia. There are lockers all around the park for those who wish to keep their valuables secure. Also note that some rides don't allow you to carry on a bag so you'll have to put it in a locker anyways. The Waterworld show was excellent so be sure to note the showtimes when you enter the park so you can plan your day accordingly. Lots of opportunities for photo taking as well so don't forget your cameras! Didn't get a chance to try any of the food in the park so I can't comment on it. There are re-entries on the same day, just be sure to get a stamp before exiting. Overall I had a blast and would definitely recommend a stop here for anyone looking for a bit of excitement in Singapore!

review_277334389,“Awesomely made up... Must visit...”,"i would say that these 2 attractions in singapore should be dedicated one full day... one day for universal studios and one full day for sentosa... The quality of rides in it are just way beyond imagination... specially the Transformers... i and my wife did it thrice...the cafes and food facility inside is also amazing... most importantly dont miss the night time lighting... its just spectacular... wear clothes that are not heavy as it gets really hot on a sunny day and wear shoes or footwear which gets dry easily coz there is one ride which is a must and people tend to get drenched in it... the jurassic park one... dont worry for your clothes you get raincoats that you can buy there... lakeside view is also amazing...

Pyramid with its internal roller coaster was my favourite as it's a new experience. Park has been made with outstanding details and will make you feel as if your in real location.

The first time we went, we didn't have an express pass and missed a few rides even though we were there very early.

review_276522069,“Fun!”,"This is located within Sentosa. Entrance fee is around 68$-74$. Operation hours are from 10:00AM - 7:00PM. It's a fairly large place. It seems that one has to allot 2 days to fully enjoy the place. They have lockers and I think they provide trolleys for those with little kids as I've seen them somewhere at the entrance. Lots of families in this theme park. Lots of rides to get on, especially roller coasters, but unfortunately I wasn't able to ride due to fear of heights. We went around lunch time and we were able to get in fast but queues for the rides were very long. Worst waiting time, 60 mins. and that's for transformers which is ONE OF THE BEST attractions in the area. Water world is really fun too! Very action-packed. :D They have express lanes so you could avoid the long lines and get in fast. Tickets for the express lanes could be purchased at the entrance I think. Has lots of retail stores to buy souvenirs from and dining places to eat. But items are pretty pricey in there. Some of the cartoon characters were there for picture taking but for a limited time only. Sad we weren't able to make it with the minions and betty boop :( Weather was hot so better wear summer clothing and comfortable shoes for you'll do a lot of walking. Get a map at the entrance to guide you during your trip inside. Toilets are okay. Lots of tissues inside. They are also baby-friendly. Better to go on weekdays, there are lesser people. Be sure to bring water with you as you will need rehydration due to the hot weather. One disappointment was that staff were not that friendly and they seem to rush things. Not really helpful except for one man named John (I think he's John) at the entrance. He was the exact opposite of the other staffs in the area. Anyway, just ignore them and have fun in this wonderful place! :)

The larger the group you go with the more is the fun.The cost for 1 day pass is around SGD$ 84 but its totally worth it. Try reaching early there (preferably by 9.30 AM) so that by the end of the day you can get up on all rides. The longest queues are in the Jurrassic World section and Ancient Egypt Section. When travelling start you tour in the below sequence to enjoy the most :Madagascar Sectiuon -> Far Far Away Section -> Jurrassic world -> Ancient Egypt -> Sci-Fi City -> New York Section

review_276295114,“Definitely worth a visit but expensive for non riders”,"Universal Studios is a must visit when visiting Sentosa or Singapore. Definitely recommend to buy the express pass with your entry ticket as this gives you entry into several attractions without having to queue for half an hour or longer. If your not a rides person it is still a great visit. For non riders I recommend the Madagascar Crate Adventure, Steven Spielberg's Lights Camera Action show and the Waterworld show. The Jurassic Park Rapids ride is great until the end if you don't like heights as it raises the raft up quite high to drop it. Even for non riders there is plenty to see, quite a few shops to visit and to cool off in, plenty of food options (standard fare burgers, etc). Also plenty of toilets all around the park. For smokers there are designated smoking areas inside the park. Definitely worth a visit, visit the website and buy tickets on line ahead so you know what you will be up for.

review_275978456,“Smaller than most but great fun!”,"We loved Universal Studios! We found it to be smaller than the other ones we've been to but that worked out well because it meant we didn't need to spent the whole day there and could explore Sentosa. We prebooked our tickets- I'm not sure if it saved us much time to be honest as the lines weren't too long as we went mid-week and it was quiet anyway. If you don't mind going on the rides without your friends definitely go in the express line if you don't like waiting in line. Definitely try the Mummy roller coaster!! I hate roller coasters but pushed myself to do it and really loved it....even if I squealed like a baby the whole way!

review_275923006,“Excellent fun”,"First up, we have the more expensive queue jumping pass. If you can afford it, do it. We got on all rides within a few minutes on a weekend and several had 45-60 min waits for the main queue.The main Battlestar ride was closed when we were there, as it had been for years but we still paid full price which I think is cheeky if you are a coaster fan. It is now open again.The best rides for adults were The Mummy and Transformers. Jurassic Park water ride was good fun for adults but the kids (6 and 8) were terrified! Many of the other rides are good but pretty tame and so more family friendly. The Live shows are good.As you enter the park, after New York Main Street, circle left for the more child friendly rides first, alternatively circle to the right for the more adult rides first.

review_275884540,“Fun-filled day out”,"You don't need to say much on this attraction as the Name of it kind of sums it all up. A heads up however, the park ticket is usually SIN$73- go onto the internet and search for deals. Most involve residents if Singapore however I managed to prebook tickets at home before I left and printed them out to take to the park. At the time (May 15) there was a deal of SIN$10 discount if you booked via a MasterCard credit card. Its not much off but why not! When purchasing tickets you can pay a little extra for a fast track ticket which aids you through the queues at rides so your wait is less. The park is situated on the island if Sentosa in which a cable car is needed to get to (very expensive) or, as I did, took a $4 monorail ride from Harbourfront station, which took literally 5mins. If you have ever been to the American Universal studios it's obviously based on this. It is a little smaller to get around and maybe not quite as equipped as the American partners but not disappointing in the slightest. Luckily for me revisited in the low season so the longest I waited for a ride was literally 10mins. I went on every ride 2-3 times as there were just no queues! I can imagine in the high season the wait would be quite horrific and this is were a fast track ticket would be beneficial.The park is laid out in ""worlds"" . Its incredibly easy to navigate around the park and there are numerous water fountains peppered around to quench that thirst.There are also an abundance of shops, restaurants and Small food stalls darted around the park also. I can't really say much more. Its Universal Studios... it is what it is. Just research the price of the tickets. Having a MasterCard really helps to reduce the bills!

review_275875091,“Excellent Outing Specially for Kids”,"If one is movie buff and wants to add some excitement along with site seeing then this is the place. One can travel to this place by road or by cable car from Vivo City Mall, we took the latter and enjoyed the ride thoroughly. Tickets for the entry can be bought at the venue or before hand at city. Depending on what month and season it is, there could be long queues at the enterance. After entering one can experience movie characters dotting the exhibits of Universal Studies. It's a whole day affair, but still one can add may be Merline or Marine Life Park. There are lots of rides and also photo taking opportunities. Highlight of the visit was Water World Show. Kids thoroughly enjoyed the place.

As if its always their first show performed because the actors are still so passionate. What a great show.I strongly recommend Universal studios for 2 days to maximize the fun attraction and shows.

review_275842900,“A longbut rewarding day out”,"First things first, get there early and for the love of God, buy the Express tickets.. We went to Universal Studios on a Saturday and it was packed. We should have got there early as the wait times for most rides were close to an hour without the Express ticket and for the new Cylon Vs Human ride the wait time was 140 mins but only about 30 for Express. Generally there is nowhere to sit while in the queue so it gets very tiring just standing, and then the ride is over in 3 mins or less. All in all good fun though, the fireworks at 8pm are a nice way ro end the day. Best to take a bus off the island, not the monorail as you will get to harbourfront station much quicker. Take the RWS1 bus to get to the Merlion then you can walk or taxi from there.

The outdoor roller coaster ride was not operational, other than that all good. They have an iOS app which i used to handily check different show timings as well as wait times.Download this app.My son who is just above 120 cm could sit in all rides when accompanied by adult. Transformers, mummy indoor coaster, donkey show, waterworld show, spielberg show, jurassic ride, etc. was fun. Veg food option limited and quality was not good. It was food for the masses not well done and breads appeared stale too. Wear comfortable shoes and put on a cap as you have to walk around in the singapore sun.

Yes, I understand that some visitors would like to buy some photos to take home as a souvenir to remind them of their time at Universal Studios but $25SG for ONE photo? Come on, seriously.

review_274934419,“A fun day”,"This was the most fun ever,,even though we were not into big scary rides there was enough there to fill in your time,,and not that expensive if you get a Park Hopper, where you can chose which attractions you want to see,,we enjoyed the WaterWorld show,,that was very well done,, but word of warning if you don't want to get wet sit out on the sides,,not in the middle, if you want a lot more fun sit right in front,,there are drying cubicles around the areas to dry off in,,we did the Jurassic park ride,,,a lot of fun and you may get a little bit wet,,,but a good ride,,,the Madagascar ride was fun too,,,little ones may not like the dark,,but there is plenty there to take their minds of the dark once the ride starts,,there were plenty of places for food and drinks,, toilets in a lot of places so not hard to find one easy,,,meet some of the stars and have your picture taken with them,,,shops for souvenirs,,and not to expensive,,but spend the whole day there you will need it,,if any queries send me a question..this is for all ages,,

review_274903242,“Awesome experience”,"My first trip to Universal. Its a must for all, kids, adults all age group. There's something for all. The best thing we did was we went on a weekday. So we didn't spend much time in queues for the rides & shows. Transformers, waterworld, Mummy Returns, Jurassic park were too good. The only disappointment was that the roller coaster ride was closed for maintenance ( for long its been closed).

review_274663016,“Good Place but not air conditioned.”,"I feel such places should definitely be air conditioned. Considering Singapore's climate, it should be covered and made air conditioned. Otherwise, nice rides and 3D experience. But repetitive in nature too. Seems overpriced

review_274478773,"“Action, adventure, action...”","A very well thought of tourist attraction and a must go place for kids and adults alike.I would advise buying a ""fast pass"" along with the ticket so that you spend more time enjoying the attractions rather than waiting for you turn in the long queues.The kids specially enjoyed their interactions with various Disney characters, the simulated shows - water world and other special effects.Even with a special pass we found it difficult to cover everything in one day...will definitely want to go back.

review_274410304,“best attraction in Singapore”,"I really can say that Universal Studios was the best attraction in Singapore . Its an amazing place with so much to see and do ! my kids loves Transformers, Underwater world and Jurassic Park are the best rides. Since we went there on a holiday, the queues were too long and tiring. I personally liked Shrek 4D show which was excellent show

review_274324380,“Return of the mummy”,"I was extremely disappointed that the large roller coaster was shut when we visited. The rides were all quite tame and based around young kids. It was scorching hot as well. However the return of the mummy ride made up for it, a roller coaster in the pitch black with fire and monsters! Defiantly not for the faint hearted!

review_274306213,“Perfect for a toddler”,"If you are in Singapore and traveling with toddlers or slightly older then you will find Universal Studios not simply the perfect size but also having just about all rides bar 3 or 4 accessible to them. I would strongly recommend spending the extra money and obtaining the Express Pass so the little ones don't have to wait extensive time periods for rides. This also helps parents leaving one with the children to quickly try out rides themselves. We had a glorious day there and recommend it highly.

review_274305361,“Don't bother if you're not with kids ”,"I guess it's unfair to give it a bad rating because of preference, buts it's a heads up. There is only really 1 thrill coaster and it was CLOSED when we went. The only other good ride is the mummy ride where the employee working on the ride was rude. Attractions are very much for children. We went to go on the transformers ride but we're told to go away as they were experiencing a technical difficulty. Was fine by the end of the day and was actually good fun. There are queues for single riders, normal entry and express. Me and my partner didn't want to wait in line as were in a rush so went single riders. Which is annoying when you're trying to enjoy your day together. But people were just jumping into the express queue without tickets and jumping way ahead of us. The staff didn't do anything to prevent this. It Was frustrating for us who were just abiding by the rules. The lockers were MAYHEM! I put my bag in for the free 45 mins. Rushed back to get it before I had to start paying (money in the locker, stupid me) and it was packed with people buying lockers. I didn't have enough time to get mine open. The man who was running the locker area came over and pressed cancel when I was scanning my finger print to open mine and let a whole other family Come and start paying for one. It was VERY annoying. What I will give credit to is the sets and the scenery. Very well done with good street entertainment. I was impressed with how everything looked. But disappointed over all with the day.
