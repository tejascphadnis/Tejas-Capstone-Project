review_473775052,“I might be spoiled”,"I visited Universal Studios Singapore on a Monday, hoping there would not be much of a crowd. Instead, I discovered that everywhere in the park was very busy. I was only able to ride 3 rides in a 7 hour period, because I had to wait an average of an hour plus for the rides I did ride. I feel spoiled, because I am used to Universal Studios Orlando, which is a bigger park. The Singapore version felt like it was half the size and therefore, a little bit disappointing.

review_473753477,“Full of fun and adventure”,"Best thing to do when you visit to Singapore. Enjoyed the goose bumps slides like HUMAN, CYLON and MUMMY rides. Best among all was the TRANSFORMER ride, it was one of kind experience. Also light camera & action ride is good to get interim of cinematography. Sad part was long ques and waiting time for each ride suggest to go for express pass to enjoy all the rides in time. keep watch on show timings do not miss the water show it was thrilling to watch entire action in front of your eyes. lot of dining options yet very limited choices for vegetarian.

review_473735656,“good look but scary rides”,"when we entered the studios we first went to Madagascar. It was exciting we have to board a boat and you will go inside a broken part of a ship inside there will be the robotic characters and then you will be out of the ship. then we went to a roller coaster when it climbs the track it will be slow but when it will go down it will be superfast it was a short ride. this studio is mostly made for kids and teenagers but be careful that some rides are a little scary.

review_473724108,“You don't need an express pass!”,"I seriously think that you don't need an express pass if you don't mind waiting for 45 min~ I love the concept where the whole themepark are filled with fans, water station, keep you hydrated and chill although the weather is really hot! Must try: human vs cylon, transformer, lights camera actions.. The fireworks on every Saturday not really impressive but worth staying till late night if you don't mind~

review_473710656,“Must do in Singapore”,"I had discounted Universal Studios in my first 3 visits to Singapore, assuming it's just movie sets.

review_473613041,“Full of fun and adventure”,"Have visited here twice. And I must say each time I was so impressed.Some tricks you may wanna consider before going:Go on weekdays. Weekends are hell crowded and the queue time is about 120 min for each ride especially in the morning. You can simply buy the express pass, still facing lines but shorter.Be there at 10 AM to get the most out of it.Plan your day ahead, prioritize the rides you want to do the most as you will have short of time. My suggestions are Transformers, roller coaster (Cylon and Human), Revenge of the Mummy, Jurassic Park Rapids adventure. You can simply forget about Madagascar and Shrek 4D if you do not have enough time. But if you looking for something a bit relaxing, go for them.There are several shows during the day, not all are good but worth watching if you have time.The queues will be shorter in the evening. We got the chance to ride Cylon 3 times and Revenge of the Mummy 2. Food is of ver low quality and pricey! (I am not sure if eating will be a good idea at all before riding the high-speed rides!) Anyhow, that is the only thing you get to eat there. You can take some chocolate or granola bars or try some ice cream there (Ben & Jerry`s at Far Far Away) and then later eat dinner in Sentosa. (Chillis restaurant and some local food nearby). All the rides will be closed at 7 PM.Enjoy and have lots of fun.

review_473583315,“Mostly for kids”,"We went with a group of friends 20-30s and had a good time with them but the park is definitely more for children. There are a couple extreme rides like Human, but with relatively long waits (40 min and it was a slowish hot day). Transformers was my favorite with 3D glasses and special effects but makes many people feel sick.

review_473526984,“Brilliant!”,"We are a young family of 6 and have visited a number of parks across Asia and this was by far our best experience. The park is smaller than Universal Osaka and whilst Disney HK is magical this park is very well organized. Our longest queue was 40 mins which is unheard of at this type of park.

review_473518349,“A fun small park with poor maintanence”,"My partner and I have visited many other Universal Studios parks around the world and wanted to give this one a go while on our honeymoon. The park itself is surprisingly small and most of the themed lands merge in to one another. The ride selection was okay for a thrill seeker, but might be less so for young families. Most of the rides during our visit were open with the odd ride down for renovations which is completely understandable. One thing that was really noticeable though, especially when comparing the park to its US equivalents was that the park was poorly maintained. Most of the rides paint jobs were flaky and the theming and props looked like they had been through a hurricane. I really wasn't expecting this from such a new park and for me, it really showed the low level of commitment to maintain elements when comparing it to a Disney theme park.Would I come here again? Probably not. But if you're not really fussed about how a park is kept, and want a small handful of thrilling rides, go for it.

review_473498363,“Loved it! Had lots of fun with family ”,"A great place to spend one full day and evening! Have a lot of amusement activities for all ages. The tickets allows unlimited entry for all the rides and shows. Spend some time researching the rides and shows that one likes before reaching, as some may have long queues. We went there on a weekday and found that the queues were empty in the evening to leisurely enjoy the place. Must visit in Singapore.

review_473393726,“Must visit”,"Hell lot to walk.Gear up comfortably. Carry abundant snacks with you. A must pack is the selfie stick.It can rain any moment in Singapore, do not forget to carry an umbrella or raincoat. In case of rain, all the attractions are temporarily withdrawn for the safety of the visitors. So please do have the time margin in mind. Do not pack your schedule.Arrive by 10.00 am to experience the most of it. Universal is best to be visited on a weekday to avoid the rush. Even on a weekday, buy an express pass. Depending on your group, you can plan your visit. More time spent on kids activities if with kids. Must visits: Battlestar Galactica Human & Cylon Accelerator Transformers Jurassic park rapids adventure (wet ride) Live water show (water world)Madagascar, Shrek & Puss in the boots are very well planned. Even for an adult it is a relaxing experience.Live shows keep happening at various times. Plan as you please.After each ride, you exit at a store. Do not forget to pick goodies.The major rides need you to place your stuff in lockers. In case you are more of an adventure person, can select multiple entry pass.

review_473333699,“Sentosa universal Singapore ”,"This was a nicely done park for its themes. Maybe I'm getting a bit older and have seen it and done it before. The roller coasters looked pretty insane but didn't go on because I felt a bit unwell. Food was the usual theme park food: terrible fast food and soft drinks or water. Shops were so highly priced I didn't bother to buy anything-usual theme park though. I didn't feel it was anything that amazing, just another theme park! I've heard queues are bad on the weekend, I went during the week and they weren't bad. Like 10mins waiting for transformers ride.

review_473312555,“Underwhelming but express pass is a must”,"I have been to Disneyland Paris and now Universal Studios Singapore and must say it pales in comparison to Disneyland Paris. Not much to do if you are with young kids but it is not a bad place by any means.Couple of things - Get lots of water as I had heard you get water but not once did I find a spot. We bought a long sipper due to which we could get an liquid refilled at no charge as long as we had that sipper. Also, get a hat and raincoat since the weather is fickle. Also please get an express pass as it will save loads of time and enable you to do most rides. Since we had planned to go to the SEA aquarium, we left at 3 pm from there otherwise we would have done all rides. You also have the option of re entry on the same day as they stamp you before you leave. You also get baby prams on rent for SGD 15 which is a bit steep but it serves the purpose.The gift shop at the start is also quite decent, not as many options as Disney but you can get lot of stuff nevertheless. You can buy and they give you the option of picking it from a drop off point so use that option to avoid carrying luggage.Now for the park - it is shaped like a big circle. You can start from the left which is Madagascar and take the water ride as well as get yourself clicked with the cast of Madagascar and do the merry go round if you have a child (this is something which was easier to do as compared with Disney). Then you go to Far Far Away or the land of Shrek where you can do the Shrek 4D ride and the Puss in Boots Adventure Ride. While the Shrek 4D takes almsot an hour, it is not as impressive so avoid if you are short on time. Do the Puss in Boots ride though as it is different and quite good.Then move to Jurassic park for the roundabouts, the water adventure and the roller coaster - all of which are good. After that you go to the land of Pharaohs, Egypt which has a roller coaster and an adventure ride.The to the transformer section where you can do the really scary roller coaster and the Transformers 7D ride which is basically the best ride in the park. This is a must. Avoid getting clicked by the photographers who charge a bomb for their photos but if you must then there is a parade at 3 pm which is in the Sesame street section which is after the transformers section and there you can get yourself clicked and later on printed as well. The Sesame Street portion has diners and is covered with a skylight so you can relax there.A suggestion here is that get the map via google, explore all rides on youtube and then see which ones you want to do and do them first when you get there This will save time alongwith the Express pass which reduces waiting time by 30 mins. Beware though that some rides are not covered under express pass so waiting is a must for them.Have fun but if you have been to Disneyland Paris then dont expect it to be at the same level.

review_473248702,“A fun family day”,"Our family (kids 3, 9, 11) spent most of the day at universal. We made sure we were there pretty much as it opened. The crowds built up as the day went on but ok early December it wasn't too busy. It was hot but not uncomfortably so. There were some line ups. The longest was probably 20 minutes so ok. Food, as you expect, wasn't cheap but ok.The kids all had a great day. By about 4pm we had done enough though.We took​ a stroller for the three year old and were very thankful that we did. Lots of walking for little legs.We had a few shots of rain so were glad of our rain ponchos.We had to do a bit of splitting up to keep all ages happy.Older kids loved the Shrek roller coaster best.

review_473047972,“GOOD family fun!”,"Our young family enjoyed the studios a lot. It's such an easy trip from the city ($12 cab) Here are a few tips. Midweek crowds are much more manageable. Try to avoid the weekend crush. The express pass is a MUST with young kids. Even on a moderately busy day, the queues were from 30mins to 1.5hrs for the Transformers ride (which was excellent). The pass is not cheap, but it allows you to bypass the queues almost entirely. In the hot weather, this makes a huge difference to the day's enjoyment. We managed to go on all the rides we wanted (12 of them) and left with smiles. The pass is cheaper off-peak (early in morning, or after lunch) and can be bought in many places around the park. Bring spare clothes for little ones (some rides are wet, and there is a small water fountain play area). You can fill up water bottles around the place. The locker system is an annoyance for some of the larger roller coasters. You have to check your bags before you ride. On busy days there is a locker queue. It's free for 2.5 hours so it might be an idea to check your bags and do the two largest rollercoasters first (Sci Fi world and Mummy World).

review_473020314,“Universal was a good day out”,"The highlight for me and my family was the Sesame Street Breakfast. This was definitely 5*!To enter Universal before it officially opens was an amazing feeling. We then went to breakfast where Cookie Monster led my youngest child to the buffet. The breakfast experience was amazing. The sesame street characters took their time with all groups and their staff assisted in taking photos for us. An amazing experience.After breakfast, Universal officially opened so we started to explore. My children's favourite ride was the Elmo one. Universal was fine but I expected more. I've been to Disneyland a few times and felt that Disneyland was run much better than this Universal. They could do so much more. It was a good day out but I wouldn't rush back to Universal Singapore

review_472896886,“Interesting disorganized and an over crowded adventure park”,"The park has interesting themes and exciting rides but the surging crowds was a put off. We spent about five hours here and could do just three events that lasted a total time of about 30 Mins.The rest was spent on standing in a queue awaiting our turn and searching for items of interest and eating in a restaurant. The Jurassic park theme was pretty good but the ride lasted just 6 minutes after a wait period of about 50 plus minutes. Madagascar also was good but fortunately the wait period was shorter. The question of whether the visit is worth the price is difficult to answer. All the themes are good. There are some that interests kids and some for teens and others for adults. Re- organizing the park with detailed information on the various themes and some brief summary of what can be seen or experienced plus a map of the park with directions and sign boards etc. and instructions would go a long way to help visitors to manage their time in the best possible manner inside the park, If these are already available they are obviously not available to every one. I was searching for the official website of Universal Studios for such information but could not find one. I could get only information provided by third party tour operators for this attraction.Paying extra for an express ticket to jump the queue was an option I was not very keen on. One jumps the queue encroaching the time from the standard ticket holder's time there by raising his/her time in the queue.An absorbing subject for a debate in ethics.

review_472382233,“Worth the experience”,"Spent the day at Universal and was put off straight away once we entered and went to go on the first ride, the guy at the entrance indicated that unsecured items should be put into lockers that were provided (which is fair enough), however every locker we went to store our goods were sold out, we then had to find someone that represented the park to give us direction (good luck with that), we eventually found two gents who were more than happy to help, they suggested to go back out and use the lockers situated just outside of the entrance, we found the lockers, then had trouble with inserting cash (again no one around to assist), eventually had success on the last go, with all this we had missed an hour and a half, not to mention lining up at the que to get in again, by the way it costs 15 dollars for a small locker outside of the park opposed to 20 dollars max inside of the park. After the initial frustrating moments we went on the first ride (battle star Galactica) which took nearly 2 hours to get through, I did put this down to the lack of organisation when we eventually reached the ride, there was way too much delay in getting people off and on (the rest of the rides were super organised), I understand the safety component, however this was due, in my opinion, poor team work (besides the ride was average). after this ride we went nearly all the major rides (I think a few people have mentioned after lunch), which did not take over 30 minutes to get on (transformers 15 mins after lunch), and found the organisation between these teams excellent. We have been to Universal in LA,Knotsberry Farm in Anaheim, Movie world and Dreamword, in Queensland, although you can not compare these to Singapore (which is overall expensive), although comparing prices for entry and food, fairly much the same across the board. As we were first timers here, I would suggest cater for the whole day here and don't forget to get your tickets from the MRT for 4 dollars each return, this is situated on the third floor of the Vivo centre. Best attraction for us was Transformers.

One thing to definitely not miss would be Steven Spielberg Lights Camera Action section where they show you a glimpse of sound and special effects. All the other rides are good. Though the rates are on a little higher side but worth it. Please reach the venue on time so that you can cover the entire thing in a day.

review_471781373,“Fun for all Ages”,"My first Universal Studios Experience and it was a blast for any movie buff. Clean and helpful staff with great sets that will amaze you. Some tips for a great day:1. Start early when its less crowded.2. Buy a priority pass (SD$30.00) but it believe me its the difference between 5 mins and sometimes 50mis in a queue. This is a must during school holidays or weekends.3. Not much dining options mostly fried food. But you can get pass-outs to eat in Sentosa and then go back inside.4. Do the Jurrasic Ride as one of your last ones because you can get pretty wet (especially your shoes)5. Wear comfortable shoes.6. Do the Water World show , Check the times that its on and dont miss out.7. People will try to cut the line, just be assertive and polite in addressing this and if they succeed in forcing their way, don't let it ruin your day (but you shouldn't get this problem if you get a priority pass).

review_471772202,“Not worth the money!!!!”,"Very expensive attraction. Beverages and souvenir very expensive. Very boring rides. Very very very long queue. This theme park is more concern about making a snake like queues. Never ending qieues. Long queues will make all the guest felt tired and also felt like giving up of coming to the USS AGAIN. Queue for nearly 1 bour while the rides only last for as long as 2 min. So dissappointing and miserable theme park ever.USS management should limit the number of guest coming to USS to avoid dissappointment among the guests. USS management also should not just think of making money for their own interest without thinking of the guests feeling. This will be my first and last trip to USS. Those guest who read this might want to think twice before coming here.

review_471662183,"“Great technology, but not for a thriller seeker”","First, I should be honest that the technology and design in this amusement park is really great. But so sorry, the attraction is more appropriate for kids. They only have battlestar galactica and mummy revenge for thriller seeker, I even can said both is not really scary.. you will see a lot of children (about 7 years old) go to this ride, it means that it is not too scary for kids. Another good attraction is transformer, but that's awesome because of the technology, good but not scary at all.. another attraction is just like a kid's toys or modern doll house. Nice, but not for a thriller seeker. You also should be patient in facing unfriendly staff. Most of them is really annoying, their expression shows if they are too tired and always tell everything in a hurry. Not recommended for thriller seeker, but recommended for family and adult who loves relaxing attraction.. hope they will build another serious thrilling attraction for adult and teach their staff to be more friendly.

Almost the same with US LA.We went there on Wednesday, and the crowd is still a lot.We able to complete most of the rides on time.The Roller Coaster is a long queue, but worth it.The Shrek4D waiting time is a bit too long.The Mummy ride is awesome. We love it.The best is still the Waterworld Show. A must go show. Don't miss this.The actors and actresses are so awesome and funny. 5 stars performance.Rocketfella is a bit boring.Sesame Street show is quite ok.Food is just normal.We used a SGD5 meal voucher that came with the tickets that we bought online.

We were able to get around all the rides we wanted (my partner and I, no kids) and have a leisure couple of leisurely meals. The rides were great, loved the battle star galactica ones and the I loved the transformers 3D thing, that was a real surprise.

The Water World show is a must to go see, get there early for splash zone seats.

review_471413775,“Great Day Out”,"Spent a day at the park.Went on a Friday which was relatively quiet as we walked on most rides with a maximum 5 minute wait time.We purchased a ticket which included hotel pick up and transfer to the park, cost £86.00 for the two of us. Return vis the MRT Train system costing £3.50 for us both. That was to Orchard Road City Centre (Holiday Inn) . See separate review for that. If you made your own way to the park on the underground system the park entrance is only £33 each plus of course the £1.75 each train fare.This is a very small park in comparison to the USA, but still worth the entrance fee.Really easy to navigate round the park, you can go left or right on entry and the park is roughly in a circle.On average two rides per area and there are 6 areas to exploreThere are 4 thrill rides, one water rapid ride ( you will get wet, even soaked) The rest of the rides I would describe as family friendly.Other than the rides must do's are Shrek 4D Adventure and Waterworld Live stunt show ( a must see )Plenty of eateries, including ice cream stands catering for all tastes and dietary requirements. Cost of eating and drinking quite reasonable even though you are a captive audience. Note you can't bring your own food and drink in, your bag is searched on entry.All in all had a great day, spent about six hours here only stopping for a half hour lunch

This universal studio is the right place to keep them occupied. Need at least a whole day to have some fun here otherwise you will be missing out on heaps of things. Please make sure you buy your tickets through the taxi driver its cheaper than buying through the agent. I am a big fan of roller coaster and they have some awesome 1s too. The live show at the water world is great if you are into loud noise gun fires canon balls and water splashes...food and drink is quite expensive inside.

They have 5 really good rides, 3 of them roller coasters, one is the Transformers 3D ride and one a water rapid. They have lots of other roller coasters, shows and rides but they are more for kids or people who like calmer rides. The queues can be quite long, and in case of thunderstorm they will close most of their rides and this not being an unusual happening in Singapore be prepared to take a break in the afternoon. If you don't like queuing I recommend buying an express pass for just 30 dollars.The best thing about this place is that it is not just a theme park, the decoration and atmosphere is magical! Don't expect though too many rides, but look forward to a really wonderful experience.

review_470634617,“Beats any theme park available in Australia ”,"As someone who spent formative years (and some adult ones) living in the US I am very hard to please when it comes to theme parks. On this occasion I was bringing my 10yo who has no memory of visiting a decent theme park (including her first birthday spent at Disneyland in Anaheim). I know this is one of the smaller Universal parks so I was focussed on having my daughter just enjoy whatever was on offer given she really had nothing to compare it to. However I found this park to be better than my expectations and it definitely delivered for my 10yo who went from being terrified of roller coasters to a hardcore lover of them in only one day at Universal Studios Singapore. Favourites were definitely Revenge of the Mummy, Transformers and Battlestar Galactica (both sides) - and the Rapids ride in Jurassic Park was a great way to warm up to the more thrilling stuff and to cool off in the tropical heat simultaneously. Great atmosphere, fairly decent food and good staff made for a very memorable day for us. Would definitely visit again.

You should save energy before go here in Universal to make sure you can try all. They open at 10AM and close I think till around 1900. Better you eat first before go here coz food inside is kinda more expensive. Place is actullay not so huge but if have many people you need to spend more time waiting in the line.

review_468868549,“Theme Park with Awesome Rides”,"Been here quite a few times with family and friends. The rides are fantastic. Do plan to go during weekdays and non peak seasons as the queue for rides might takes up to 1 hour. Its a must ride for me for Transformer ride, mummy roller coaster, rapid adventure boat ride, flying canopy, puss in boots mini rollercoaster. Its a must watch for the waterworld show and Sherk 4D show. The rest of the attraction can take it if you have the time. I will always go for the shortest waiting time first as the queuing time will change sometimes will be shorter half hour later. But usually after 6pm, most of the attraction will have lesser people queuing as most of them went home already.

review_468445936,“Best roller coaster ever”,"USS is so big that you need to be there upon the time it opens. Foods are quite expensive so I advice you to bring your own water, small bag, handkerchief & an extra shirt. Going there is easy because there's a free train from Vivo city to USS. There are free locker rentals for the extreme rides which covers usually around 30-40mins, just in time when you finish the ride. The ""must-ride"" there are The Mummy, Transformers, & Battlestar Galactica. There's a map that will be given to you & make sure that you ride everything so you enjoy what you paid for. Rides vary from extreme rides to shows for children.

Keep one full day for Universal and buy express card to beat the line - lines are really long. And the best rides could take over 2hrs of standing if you dont have express tickets. With express it will take 30 mins too. Must visit rides are Transformer, Pyramid and Alien vs predator roller coaster. In food do try burgers at american diner they are amazing.

There is an event going on everywhere you turn your head. You won't have to walk that far to get to the next event and there are many rides there as well. You should get the ticket for this online as it is easier and you get a discount as well. There are a lot of restaurants inside and outside food is not allowed but there is not much food options for vegetarians/ Indians. But we still got some veg Indian food from a cafe/ restaurant in the mummy world and you could get ice cream, brownies, fries and stuff to eat as well.It will take you a whole day to see it completely and still you will feel like you missed many things, so be on time to enter.

review_467988657,"“Exciting place, but not for oldie”","I've been there twice. The first time was with my friend back to 2014. We went there on weekend and faced long queues for every ride. The second time was with my family last Oct. We was there on weekday, so the line is much shorter. The whole park was still great as usual. The best ride must be Transformer, we tried twice!!! The problem is that my parents were not really into these exciting rides. After two rides, they gave up and just walked around looking and eating instead. So, advice for those with oldie: - should not bring them there unless they are ready for thrilling games. - Food and drink could be expensive there, so it's better if you prepare some in advance. There're taps in every game, so just bring the empty bottle and you can take the water in the tap.- Be there on weekday to avoid the long queue- Bring hat and put on sunscreen to avoid the heat.

review_467701551,“Small but worthwhile ”,"You don't need multiple days as this is a very small park. In one day we were able to do everything twice. It's great for young children or as a first theme park experience. For older kids wanting a lot of fast roller coasters, it might be disappointing. Our five year old could do almost everything. Our three year old could do enough. We visited midweek and there were very short lines, normally 5 or 10 minutes if we couldn't walk right on. The longest we waited was 30 minutes for Transformers. We considered the fast passes but I'm so glad we didn't pay the extra money. No need. Crowds were very manageable. Much of the park is covered so you aren't in the hot sun too much. I had never seen that at another theme park. It was great!Expect your typical overpriced theme park food and souvenirs. They say no outside food or drinks but this didn't seem to be enforced. If I had to do it again I might bring my own snacks.

review_467456632,“Well Planned Route Helped!”,"Went there during CNY (I know!) I thought I was setting myself (and my husband) up for disaster but it turned out better than I expected! We did exactly what was recommended online. Go to the popular rides first, eat lunch early (at 12noon) and take note the show time so that we won't miss anything. We ended up riding all the popular rides more than once, some thrice! (No Express Pass required) We had lots of extra time taking pictures and even try some of the children rides (:D). However, I would like to add a few things. It is great to wear shorts with zippers so that you can keep some of your paper money with you when going for rides especially those don't allow you to bring anything with ya and asked you to lock it in the locker. The queue wasn't taking too long just we were lost track of the time and then we were stranded because we over the 40mins free period (we were there 42mins mark - serious!) and need to pay 2$ before can collect our stuff. Our wallets were inside the locker. Luckily I manage to borrow some from a kind couple that just walked in to put their stuff inside the locker. Or better still load your EzLink card with some money on it and just carry it around inside your zipper pocket :D No coins because the staffs will buzz you out from the queue. We brought our own raincoat, one that provides good protection but thin. Because what they sell inside the themepark really do nothing for you. We even get to enjoy the Water World Show right at the wet area without being (soaking) wet! Don't go for Cylon and Human first if you are there early in the morning right when the themepark open. Why? Because that early, they are not running at full capacity. So eventho the lines aren't long but it will take double the time to clear. That's what happened to us..so after the Human ride, we went to another one then came back for Cylon when it is running at full capacity. We had a great time!

review_467447783,“The most fun we had in Singapore!”,"I think Universal Studios was the part of our trip that all of us were looking forward to the most. We visited the park on October 10, 2016.We booked our tickets online on the Sentosa site and received a discount + a free water bottle (with the head of the Indominus-Rex from Jurassic World). I would recommend the online reservation because you won't have to spend a ton buying water bottles within the park, and the refills are not as expensive as filling up once.We entered the park around at 10 am, and Beetlejuice was standing near the entrance. We went on the Jurassic Park River Rapids ride first, and then went on The Mummy. The later's queue was around 45 minutes the first time we rode it, but we didn't get bored. There is music and sound effects along the way, and plenty to look at.We had lunch at the Discovery Center in Jurassic Park - wet noodles with vegetables. Four of us shared three plates as the quantity is pretty big and it's a little expensive. So this is a good option for vegans. The ambiance in the place was of course great.I emailed the company before-hand about options and they also suggested the Oasis Space Cafe. Their Indian option with chana masala, rice and papadums is vegan. Being Indian, we didn't want to have Indian food even on vacation (: Via email, they also said they could customize a pizza without cheese or dairy products. So make sure to contact them in advance if you have any special dietary needs.After lunch, we made our way towards the junction where Jurassic Park, Water World and Far Far Away meet, and got to see the raptor show. Took a bunch of pictures and successfully answered that Bubbles was a velociraptor (yay dinosaur-loving me!) We rode The Mummy again around at 3 pm and the wait time was only 10 minutes (yay!) We also walked around and discovered other places like the Canopy Flyer. If you walk a little further inside, you will see nice picture areas with a T-Rex fossil head and broken dinosaur eggs that you can sit in.Unfortunately we couldn't meet any of the Sesame Street characters. When we got to the designated area, they were leaving to take a break, and when we came back they still hadn't returned.Before leaving, we rode Madagascar A Crate Adventure, King Julien's Beach Party-Go-Round, Spaghetti Space Chase, Accelerator, Lights, Camera, Action, and Shrek 4-D Adventure.Our favorites were definitely Jurassic Park Rapids, The Mummy and Canopy Flyer.The park is small and the day we went, the crowd wasn't too big. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Everyone who worked there was always smiling. Would definitely visit again, thanks for the memories and the experience Universal Studios!

It is not well sign posted and we had no idea how far it was from the transport. There is a lot on this Island and Universal appears tucked away in a corner. Once there it is a great place, first of all we received the Seniors Discount (it doesn't matter which country you are from - if you are over 60 you can get in at the Seniors Rate - just let them know when buying your ticket).

But, that did not limit us from having all the fun! There are loads of things to do at Universal Studios for everyone. My Son (5 year old) had lots of fun at the Puss in Boots, Far Far Away from Shrek series, Madagascar themed ride, Transformers, etc. We had a great time riding on Battle Star Galactica! It's a great experience. Don't miss that. If you can go there on a weekday around 11, you can pretty much cover everything without buying an add-on express ticket. But if you are not so lucky, then better to buy an express ticket! This allows you to skip the queue for lost of the rides! Don't miss the Ancient Egypt and the Lost World attractions. If you are not too fussy about drinking water, try to carry an empty bottle so you can fill it up at various water stations inside! Food is expensive inside the studio, but you can always have god at the Malaysian Food court just outside Universal Studio. If you are lucky and it doesn't rain, you will have lots of fun! We plan to go there again during my son's school holidays!

We were not able to try all the rides due to limited time we reached the park before lunch and went out exactly at the park's closing time. It was a tiring but fun day! I'll definitely come back here to try the other rides that I was not able to try. The best ride I tried was Transformers and Battlestar Galactica-Human. Worth all the wait! And oh if you don't want to wait too long for Battlestar galactica ride one tip i can give is try riding it before the park close no lines and whatsoever! Haha!I'm just sad that I was not able to take photos with the characters especially Minions because they only come out for a couple of mins and they won't allow you to line up if its past the given time.

Food stalls are found everywhere, you cannot go hungry with tons of them around you. If you're travelling with kids it's better to prepare strollers with you.

review_466380828,“Bucketloads of fun”,"Came here to celebrate my son's 4th birthday. We had a great time. Despite him having a flu, he had plenty of fun in uss. My boy is a real animal cartoon fan, so the madagascar rides were his personal favourites. Luckily he's seen the shrek movie before we came here too. He loved the shrek dungeon cinema thingy too. Although the queue was long and the briefing took a while, it was all worth it. The water effects from the donkey sneeze & other scenes was a major talking point for him all the way back to the hotel. So we knew that the short movie screening was memorable and enjoyable for him. We, the parents could not go for the sci fi rollercoaster rides becoz it was just the 3 of us and my toddler was ineligible for then. One of us had to take care of the child, so it would be less enjoyable to experience it alone. The people we saw who took them seems to have had a really good time. Who knows, maybe we'll be back again when he's grown up to enjoy the rides we couldn't take this time around. Plenty of retail shops and eateries in here too. A great many options from the themed shops all the way to the main one at the entrance. Goods and merchandise cane with plenty of variety and it would be a challenge for anyone coming out of those shops empty handed what with the great many varieties you guys have on offer. Another thing to mention is the appearances by characters which are lively and well scheduled out thruout the day. We had bucketloads of fun with the penguins and other madagascar characters. Special mention to the big guy who hosted the madagascar dance thingy. He is lively & friendly. Thank you to the whole uss team, i feel that you guys set the benchmark for a well organised theme park within our region which other similar parks can try match or gauge their own standards.

review_466064224,“Small but great park”,"If you are in Singapore then Universal is certainly worth a visit. I purchased a six month pass as I was working in the area for a while, so I visited a couple of times. The attraction is very well themed and usually the queue's are only small, it's probably not worth paying for fastrack during the weekdays. The best rides in my opinion are the Terminator-don't miss this out it really is fantastic. The Mummy Returns, again another good ride in the dark and finally Battlestar Galactica. Take suncream as it's easy to get burnt whilst walking around. Food options are good-I can recommend the Turkey Legs and also the pumpkin sandwich from the Jurassic Park area.

One of the places that we have enjoyed the most was the visit to the Universal Studios. Indeed, the place was very inviting. This amusement place made me bring myself to my childhood. The venue was not just for children to enjoy but also for the adults to make memories with family and friends.In reference to cleanliness and orderliness, its truly amazing that you can never see litter around. The staff/ employees were very accommodating and friendly. The service was excellent. I feel like going back again to Singapore and bring my kids with me to feel how lucky they are as children and how fortunate they are to enjoy life as it is.Universal Studios Singapore does not only offer quality services, they provide memories to cherish and pride to uphold.

There were various activities available for any age group, but the Waterworld show is not to miss. My friends and I also enjoyed Transformers: The Ride.

review_465500386,“Disappointed ”,"I must say I had high expectations for this amusement park and I was very disappointed. If you are going with smaller children perhaps it is more fun. But we were four adults (our children are 18 and 20). There are maybe 5 or 6 rides that were exciting, but the rest is quite lame. I also found the park to be very small. We have near my home (in Germany) an amusement park that is probably 3 to 4 times bigger, with 11 roller-coaster, plus several other attractions. Being this in Singapore and for that price I don't think it was worth the money. In our opinion the good rides were, gallactica, transformers the ride, the mummy, jurassic park rapids and the Shrek 4D movie is OK but we have seen better ones.

review_465205411,“Fun day out!”,"After being to Universal LA, this isn't as good but was well worth the visit!The day we went there were not too many people. Best to go when it opens and go to the most popular rides first. You can buy an express pass that lets you go to the front of the queue on most rides once. We purchased this but didn't use it until later in the day when more people were at the park and the wait times were 45 minutes plus - wired a treat because you actually do skip the queue to the front. Food as expected was delicious but overpriced, drinks the same. We were going to get public transport there but found it easier to get a taxi. Going home we rode in the cable car over the water from Sentosa. Great day out for everyone!

review_465187778,“Great day out”,"Universal Studios is a great day out and brings out the inner kid in us all. The rides are good and there are a good amount of options for those who don't like things like roller coasters. The best ride was probably the Jurassic Park rapids ride, however you do get wet! We didn't mind at all as it was such a hot day that some splashes were nice, however sitting around in wet shoes all day is not nice. Make sure that you take shoes that it doesn't matter if they get wet as they will easily dry! We purchased the front of line pass - and although we didn't go on a number of rides (all the roller coasters) it was still worth the purchase. Some of the rides had wait times of 45-75 minutes, yet with the front of line pass you go right to the front and get through immediately. It is very hot at Universal Studios so try to choose a cooler day to go.

review_464895968,“Fun Day Out”,"Universal Studios Singapore is a great place to spend the day, whether young or old. Getting to the park is relatively easy, by taking either the Sentosa Express or cable cars to Sentosa, which are close to MRT network.If visiting as a couple with the other half not too interested in the 'big' rides, this saves you a lot of time, particularly as the 'big' rides (the rollercoasters, basically) allow single riders. This saves a lot of time, particularly as during peak times these rides have waiting times varying for between the 45 and 90 minutes. I would recommend going on the 'big' rides in the first hour or two of opening, as you will be disappointed otherwise. You can buy a pass which allows you express entry onto these rides, but this costs about $60 extra, so can result in an expensive day out.Even a few of the family friendly rides are worth a go, even if you don't have kids with you (Puss in Boots and Sesame Street). We queued over an hour for the Madagascar ride, and to be fair, this is pretty average and wouldn't recommend doing so.

Also, we love the freebies that came with it.We went on a weekend which explains the long queue but we got to see the parade which is a plus!Not advisable for hot summer days given Singapore's humid weather.The staff at the gate was rude. We went out to exchange our $$ at the money exchange right outside the gate and we were stamped with ""invisible"" mark for returning in.When we got back after exchanging currencies, she would not let us in. I do not know if that was trickery of some sort to have less people at the park. We asked her what was the ""invisible"" stamp for if she would not have a way to trace if we were really returning or just trying to sneak. I used to think of theme parks as happy places in Earth.

Fans were plenty along queue lines. Opportunities for snacks and water were plenty. Rides were good even for scaredy cats like me. If one was looking for wilder/higher rides, this park may not be it.Please ensure that sun protection advice are followed as it can get very hot esp between 10am til 5pm.

review_464429484,“Good park”,"We spent in the studio whole day and tried almost every single attraction, staff was very friendly and smiling whole day.We would recommend to not miss Mummy area, of course sci-fi attractions and despite the fact we are not fans of transformers, 3D drive there was simply the best.Unfortunately (big BUT), you can buy express pass which allows you to go to the special queue and you skip the line. At some attractions there were so many people with this pass that even they made queue and waiting time for normal people was incredibly long. We absolutely not agree with this mechanism and in our opinion it is not way which park should go. It is only making people mad and angry.Another point is that in Jurassic park you need to pay for locker (longer you use it, more money you pay), and together with many people with express pass you are just paying more for locker because they are skipping the queue (you wait more, pay more).If you would like to eat something, we definitely recommend Mel's bistro - great atmosphere with nice double burger.

We bought the express pass which works on majority of the rides at the park and I have to say it paid for itself 5 times over. We skipped numerous ques which had waiting times of over 90 minutes... our longest wait was about 5. It was a lifesaver in the heat as well as a lot of the line areas aren't air conditioned and it was extremely hot. The food was extremely overpriced, which you expect so it's fine, but it was also really terrible... I don't know if we just chose the wrong places to eat but we didn't like anything. Getting there is super easy, it's just a tram ride over and you can buy you ticket to the park when you buy for the tram so you don't have to wait in line twice.

review_463604782,“Fun-filled USS Day in Surprising Singapore”,"I have been to Universal Studio Singapore numerous times (having owned their annual pass and season pass before), but I never tire of it.If one enjoys adrenalin inducing roller coaster rides, then Battlestar Galactica is a must. The Cylon (inverted / suspended blue track) is more exciting as it ends with a 360 degree loop and has a spiral. The first time I sat on it, I was thrilled to look upwards to clear blue sky, whilst experiencing G force. But this time, the wait was 50 mins so we checked out the traditional Human (red track) instead. Surprisingly, the wait was only 5 mins, after an afternoon rain. In the morning, it was a 55 min wait. So we happily sat on Human twice. Although 'tamer', Human is nevertheless still exhilarating.We also recommend Revenge of the Mummy which we also went on twice (5 min wait only), and simply could not get enough of this wild ride in the dark.Canopy Flyer was great too, with a 15 min wait only.My overseas guest was thoroughly impressed with Transfomers which is great for all ages, and not to be missed (well worth the 40 min wait). It was down in the morning, but thankfully was fixed in the afternoon.Lights, Camera, Action is always exciting to watch, for the incredible special effects of a Category 5 hurricane about to hit New York.I also never tire of watching Shrek 4-D Adventure.The new Sesame Street show ""When I Grow Up"" at Pantages Hollywood Theater is really for toddlers and young kids only. Many adults left half way.Due to inclement weather, Water World (I always enjoy watching the stunt folks at work) was cancelled.This place is highly recommended for both overseas visitors and locals alike.Families, friends and couples will certainly enjoy a great day.The fun atmosphere and enjoyable theme park ambience provides a lovely respite from our stressful lifestyle.TIPS: You can now avail of their lockers for free (upto 45 mins), so glasses, handphones and bags can be safely stored before your rides.They have water coolers outside their restrooms. You may even bring an empty bottle to refill water.Try to eat before or after the peak lunch time period.Their burgers and pizza make an affordable and quick tasty re-fueling for the day.Or you can get your re-entry stamp on your hand, and eat outside (at Resort World Sentosa with more F&B options) instead.First thing when you enter, dash off to the more popular rides such as Battlestar Galactica and Transformer first. We note that the queing time tends to get longer, as the day progresses.Bring your umbrella or raincoat as it can rain any time.You really need 1 full day to enjoy this theme park completely.When buying tickets on-line or at their counters, check if they have any promotional entry price or special package. There is usually some credit card promotion going on.

review_462802331,“Quality Universal Experience”,"The Universal Studio's theme park in Singapore is a quality theme park with a mix of favorite attractions from the U.S. parks and new attractions for Singapore. The park is small so you transit from neighborhood to neighborhood fairly quickly. The backdrops, sets, and street dressing are done well (but due to the smaller size can look a bit odd when you can see the next neighborhood right in the background of the current one).We went on a weekday (hours 10 am to 6 pm I believe). The entry process was fairly smooth and there wasn't much of a rush at 10:15 when we go to the gate. There are many options for purchasing tickets (try to do it on-line and print before you go if for no other reason to just make the process smoother). We had to find a kiosk selling tickets at the park and the signage was less than helpful (it was unclear where they were selling which tickets). Inside the park it was pretty easy (and almost no wait) to get on the rides or attractions for the first few hours. After 1 pm things started to get crowded. I can only image what a weekend may look like (especially Saturday which is the only day they have the character parade and evening fireworks). Food options in the park are pretty standard (fancy themed names for things, pretty bland, average food at pretty special or high prices).The different show timings were not well advertised (only at the spot of the show itself) and in their program it was unclear which shows would be street performances and which were inside proper facilities. The park also lacks a few rest areas (benches, cooling stations, etc.) that would make the experience more pleasant.Overall a pretty good experience and we had fun until our little one decided with the heat and jet lag they she had had enough and it was time to go home.

review_462639610,"“Universal Studios Sentosa, a great theme park”","One of the better things to do in Sentosa. I'm a fan of theme parks, and although USS is one of the smaller amusement parks I've been to, there's something here for everyone. Lots of great rides and attractions. Food isn't spectacular though, and it's kind of expensive. Best rides are still Transformers and Battlestar Galactica. Waterworld is also a great show to catch! The parade was just good though. It's definitely good for day usage. I would recommend the fast pass if you can afford it, as you will cut down on the longer lines, but if you can wait 30-45 minutes for the bigger rides, it'll be fine. Great stuff!

The rides were so much fun and there was plenty to choose from for both children and adults.We bought the express pass which was well worth the $50 extra. It meant on rides that had a 20-40 minute wait time, you go straight to the front and don't have to wait at all! Well worth it, it meant we went on rides that we liked, multiple times.

review_462561606,“A Day's Visit.”,"Went here for a day out.It is a small amusement park with a variety of themed sections and rides that cater for different age groups.We went around mid October 2016 on a weekday and it wasn't as busy as we were expecting.The rides were calmly subtle to screamingly wild. Some were 5 minute queues and some were more than an hour long.Everything that is sold within the vicinity is quite pricey typical of Universal Studios.They have water fountains in various areas usually near the toilet where you can grab a drink or refill your bottle. Also, there is a hawker area just outside the park which is considerably more affordable with a selection of options for a nice meal.

review_462400479,“Great day but expect to wait for popular rides”,"Went on Friday - try and avoid weekend. Opens at 10:00. Excellent mix of rides and shows for little ones to the big kids! We waited 60 minutes in line for the raft ride, and some were up to 90 minutes long so keep water with you! Good thing is that most waiting areas are undercover. If you don't mind splitting your group up, opt for the 'single rider' lane, much faster. Transformers ride was excellent!! Good food options and not too expensive as they tend to be in theme parks, happy hour drinks at KTs at 4:00 - Fantastic Mojitos!! Note that many rides do not allow bags/hats/sun glasses and you will need to hire a locker for $4/hour - if your wait time goes over the hour you have to pay again to have it unlocked. Tip - if you want to have the sky gondola ride back to Vivo city at end of day, buy the combined pass with Universal ticket and save $25 per adult.

review_462370815,“Beware”,"Entered the Battlestar Galactica roller-coaster ride. The sign said 5 minute queue. We waited in a tiny queue for 90 minutes for a 30 second ride. It was hot, there were no fans going although they were there and there was no air conditioning. Only about 4 people every 10 minutes were allowed on the ride. When I finally got to the top I found out that there was a small number of teens going around and around in the express lane and they were blocking the ride for everyone else. DO NOT VISIT THIS PARK UNLESS YOU BUY AN EXPRESS PASS WHICH MAKES IT VERY POOR VALUE FOR MONEY. Very poorly run park

So much fun, I signed up for season pass :).. Here are my tips on how to enjoy the park:- buying an unlimited express pass is totally worth it! No need to q and u can sit as many times u want on a ride.- Bring your own poncho/raincoat for the Jurassic park water rides, buying one inside USS cost $4 each- Be sure to plan to watch the shows, such as water world and Sesame Street, timings are printed on the brochure- Food is average and quite expensive, u could go to the Malaysia food street located beside USS entry for lunch/dinner instead- Bring a water bottle, there are water coolers scattered all over the park, 1 bottle of water cost like $4-5, do keep hydrated cuz it's super hot and humid in tropical Singapore- Beware of crowds of tourist from China trying to cut the queues and pushing their way to the front. :(

We went on a Tuesday and though a lot of the rides got longer and longer lines as the day went on, we got on most of them within 10 minutes- the only one was Battlestar Galactica, which took 30 minutes, even early in the day. We liked Waterworld (it's good no matter where you go!) and the Lights, Camera, Action, and Far Far Away Land (Shrek) was fun. If you like theme parks, you'll still like this, though I can't imagine doing it for more than a day.

Our favourite ride was The Mummy! The architecture and decorations around the park were very impressive, it looked almost as if we were really in the movies. You will definitely need almost a whole day here if you want to see and do everything. Queueing times for rides were not too bad when we visited, usually not having to wait any more than 20 minutes per ride. The exception to this was the very popular Jurassic Park river ride, for which we waited about 1.5 hours in the afternoon, so maybe try and get to this one early in the day.There were a variety of food outlets and shops around the park.It was very easy to get to the park via the monorail to Sentosa Island.

Be prepared to spend the whole day at Universal Studios as you will not have time to see other attractions on Santosa.

The Jurassic rapids were so much fun (which is possibly why the line was over an hour long) the high flyer was also great and had no line.There was plenty of food available inside so don't feel the need to bring a lunch. Also, pack light, the more things you bring with you the more time you'll spend in the lines for the lockers at the start of rides. We had breakfast at a pancake place near the entrance before we went in, and spent a total of about 6 hours inside. Which was enough time to cover everything we wanted to do. Had we have wanted to do the big thrilling rides we would have been short on time. Those lines were over an hour each. I will 100% be coming back here. It was a great day out.

review_460242308,“Great Place to Go!!”,"I went Universal Studio Singapore last week with my friend. It was amazing. I try almost all of the studio. They are open from 10 am - 7 pm. Sesame street on New York area, Transformer ( there is a roller coaster, I try it and it the best roller coaster I ever try),, mummy (roller coaster in the dark), jurassic park ( rafting), and many things you can do there. Entrance fee is SGD $73 per person,, you need to pay extra SGD $30 if you don't want to queue.

review_460234535,“Small but fun”,"The park itself is quite small but it was fun. We had free tickets to get in which was good as it is normally quite expensive. We purchased a one off express pass for S$50 each which gave us one express entry per ride. It was well worth it as some of the rides had wait times of 40+ mins which to be fair isn't unreasonable for a theme park. But with it being so hot and with a young child it was better to jump to the front. The park is very clean. It was very crowed with tourists (to be expected).

review_460224299,“Go there on Saturday for Hollywood Parade”,"from Sleepy kiwi we traveled by bus to Vivo City and train to USS at 8am. Please note on Vivo city there is a shuttle on bus area going to USS for a flat fare SGD1. did not see it that's why I have take the train and take the escalator up to 3rd floor. We arrived early. We eat at Slappy pancakes since it will open at 10am, going in is fast and organized. There isnt a lot of people so we are not rushing in to go in line. in fact the longest waiting time we had is 20 mins which is the Transformer ride. HIGHLY recommended to ride. No need for express pass though there is still few people purchase it. it was a really hot day so we didnt bother to going in and out to buy some food outside to save some money. The food we purchased range SGD10-15 for a regular burger meal. Milkshake is SGD7, ice cream SGD4. for souvenir I find it too pricey when converting since I came from Manila on ROE is 1PHP=35SGD just imagine it. The Hollywood parade start at 3pm very great show. I must also commend BETTY BOOP mascot is very nice.. Taking pictures with mascot are everywhere you must only ques. There will be rides that you will get, just in case you dont have raincoat or anything, there is drying Capsule for SGD5. since we almost go around USS two times we were too tired to wait for the fireworks :(, we go home at 6PM and queing on train takes time like 30 mins.

review_460040015,“Great place with even greater queues..”,"Visited the theme park with my wife and two kids aged 8 and 12. Purchased the standard tickets for about USD 40 pp. Really enjoyed the rides especially the duelling ""battle star galactica"" ride, which is not for the faint hearted and the Egyptian section which featured an indoor ride with all sorts of Egyptian monsters to keep us company. The 3D ""Transformers"" ride was also truly enjoyable. The kids also fully enjoyed the 3D movie at Never Never Land. My main grouse however was the very long waiting time for each and every ride. We were only able to complete 5-6 rides during the whole day and each ride had a waiting time of 1 hour or more. So I strongly recommend new visitors especially those with families and/or have just one day to visit, to pay extra and buy the fast track tickets. Else you are in for a long wait and risk get your blood pressure up (as I did) by fuming silently at those with fast track tickets sauntering in while you are in the queue for hours...

After 7 hours and a total of 10km covered over the course of the day; the kids saw, did and ate everything and they had a blast doing it.The park needs a full day and don't be cheap, buy the express passes otherwise you will spend the entire day waiting in line.Cylon, Transformers and the Shrek 4D were great brilliant fun. The Jurassic Park ride was not a favourite. You simply got soaked for the sake of it. It was as if the inventors ran out of ideas and figured getting people wet was a sufficient substitute for a lack of imagination. It is an expensive day out the entire family thoroughly enjoyed themselves.

The taxi from Woodlands to USS was about $24, but well worth it considering all the different buses and trains we would have had to take, and would have been almost $20 for 2 people. We visited during the tail-end of Chinese New Years, but was pleasantly surprised at the short wait times. On a few rides we too the single riders lane and got put on the same ride anyways.

From the Kingdom Far Far Away for the little kids to Sci Fi section for adults (who are kids at heart), everyone can enjoy something here. You would need at least one full day to fully appreciate everything. The food is more expensive than outside, which is natural in a theme park. It was interesting how different restaurants had a menu that catered to the theme. If you are South Asian and looking for rice, Ancient Egypt is your best bet.Make sure you pick up a map from the entrance, and travel in an anti-clockwise manner. Remember to bring a lot of water, and prepare to walk A LOT.It would save you plenty of time if you purchase the express tickets. Yes, they are more expensive than the regular ones.

review_458595591,“Great attractions for all!”,"As an adrenaline junkie like myself, the 2 things that I will never forget and will try again when I go back are:1. The Mummy - I did not expect this one to be very thrilling! I thought it would just be a boring ride. But jeezus I was blown away! It's like riding a roller coaster in total darkness! Unbelievably fun!2. Battlestar Galactica - This is the resident roller coaster of Universal Studios Singapore. It's a roller coaster with double the fun! This coaster has 2 rides. The concept is on the name itself, Battlestar Galactica. Basically it's like a fight with humans and aliens. One coaster is where you ride as the humans. A basic roller coaster ride. But the other one for me is way more fun: the aliens' side! On this other coaster, your feet are hanging! Imagine that! OMG my soul separated from my body during the first drop! I can't overstate enough how fun that ride was!But my most useful tip is this: buy express passes! Again, BUY EXPRESS PASSES!!! It's the purchase that I never regretted! It will save you a TON of time! Normal tickets will cost you AN HOUR in line waiting for your turn. But when you use express pass, it will literally take you a minute to get to the ride. There's a different line for normal tickets and for express passes. You can see the envy from the eyes of the people who endured long lines waiting. While you just walked in but you get to ride first.

review_458359781,“Fun day out ”,"My husband and I spent the day here. Now I must mention my husband is an adrenaline junkie , whilst I would say I'm the opposite . Thus I felt that the theme park catered to the both of us. Getting here is fairly easy and everything is sign posted . We took the monorail which was fast but packed . I would recommend getting here early and possibly purchasing the fast track tickets for the additional cost . As the queues were very long when we went and for example the transformers ride we waited almost two hours to get in. It was also a very hot and humid day .The studios I mentioned catered to all ages I feel. I've not been to the Florida theme park so can only base my opinion on Singapore . But they have shows , roller coasters , boat rider , souvenir shops and quite a few food outlets on site . There are different themed sections, such as the mummy, Jurassic park , shrek, transformers etc and all have there different rides and shows taking place .There are times where you may need to use the lockers as certain rides require no personal belongings. Our personal favourite ride was the water boat ride at Jurassic park. You do get slightly wet but honestly it was a breath of fresh air as we went on a very hot and humid day (humidity was at 98%). Shrek 4D was also good fun and my husband enjoyed this with the chairs moving and splashes of water on the face . The water world show was excellent and the stunts and actors had the audience fully engaged . Staff I found to be lovely honestly , they were so helpful and the service was very good. There were a couple times when some of the rides were delayed or experiencing technical problems but apart from that it is a great fun day out for all ages . And the theme park closes at 7pm .

review_458277581,“#1 in Singapore! Here are a few tips!”,"I was in Singapore on a family trip of 6 people. My parents and aunt are all above 60 while one of my cousins (24) doesn't like rides. That left me with just two of us who wanted to go to USS but I wasn't sure it justified taking all of them together and that too for an entry ticket priced at $75 each! However, it turned out to be the best day we spent in Singapore. One, it offers rides and entertainment for people of all the ages. My parents sat in ALL the rides! (I was surprised). Here are the highlights:1. The best ever stage show that I had ever seen (WATERWORLD).2. Best 4D show/ride ever. (TRANSFORMERS)3. Lights, Camera and Action.4. Great rides for adventure freaks.Here are some tips for all:TIP 1: try to visit it on a weekday. Although the queues that we found were on an average only 20%-30% occupied (of the capacity), we still ended up waiting for up to 30 minutes in a few rides.TIP 2: it is arranged in a circular layout. As soon as you enter it, look for where the crowd seems to be heading. Start walking in the opposite direction! ;)TIP 3: Single passengers have a separate queue. If you don't have a condition to sit together on a ride, it will save at least 70% of your time.TIP 4: Buy your tickets through an agent in Singapore. I got my tickets at a discount of $20 per person.TIP 5: This was the only attraction I found which gives discounted tickets for the elderly (60+) irrespective of their nationality. Tickets for my parents costed me $36 each.TIP 5: Food is very expensive inside. If you don't wanna spend that much, try getting something with you. (Before entering USS you will also find a few joints like McDonald's).

We started off early and we were there before the gates opened at 10 am but even then we greeted by a huge queue when we reached there. I read a lot of reviews before we went there to prioritize the rides , but so did everyone else !!! So we spent 2 hours in the queue for a 4 min ride which was supposed to be the star attraction - Transformers. Then we decided to do our own thing which worked out better because we were able to cover the next shows of waterworld and some of the kids rides which my 6 year old daughter absolutely loved .... Sesame Street, Madagascar, Shrek 4D. By evening a lot of the crowd had dwindled and its a good thing that the timings are now extended because we were able to cover almost everything that we wanted to.

We visited on a normal weekday in the late afternoon and the rides had anticipated wait times in excess of an hour. With the few hours we had planned to stay we would be lucky if we got to ride 3 attractions. It appears that this is normal as the queues were designed to hold hundreds of people with in queue entertainment. The rides we did experience were very well done and the park was very clean. It was extremely hot on the day of our visit and some of the queues were very uncomfortable even with the fans.

review_457103414,“Enjoyed even on a rainy day”,"On a rainy day in October, we decided to go to Universal Studios Singapore. We still managed to have an enjoyable day for the most part, as Universal Studios did a pretty good job trying to keep rides running when possible during rain breaks or light rain. Also, many of the rides are also indoors (like Transformers and the Mummy) so you can still do things even in the rain. The one bonus of the rain was that some rides had shorter breaks than usual (especially after they would stop and re-start after rain storms). Although good weather would have made it more enjoyable, we were glad to still have a fun day even with all the rain.

review_457089979,“Queueing is the way of life ”,"Straight to the point- weekends are crazy rush. Some staff have told me that Wed or Thu is a bit better but the pain of queueing will remain.- if you are a tourist I would advise to buy an express ticket else you will repent to having paid the ticket price and yet not experiencing half the rides.- don't miss the waterworld show. Also don't bother to go and queue early. It's a large seating space and you will get a good seat.- pick up the event timing sheets. Some shows are worth to visit.- hidden gem is the Guinness record of maximum lights inside an enclosed space within the Hollywood area. Check the picture attached. - No food allowed inside. Don't carry any else you will have to unnecessarily rent a locker to store your stuff

review_457009640,“Its all about the timing”,"We arrived at 10am and left at 8.30pm, so that says something!I suggest arriving around 930am so as to be one of the first in and plan the things you want to tick off first as by 11am+ the lines might start backing up. There is surprisingly a lot to do. At first glance you think it might be small, but it is quite large and the space is very well utilised. Lots of different themes and the kids will love it. There is also enough for the parents. Food was not the best (at least in the American diner we went to) and it is really overpriced. Suggest you head out of the park walk 2 mins into other parts of Resorts World to have a better dining experience. Make sure to get a stamp on the way out to save the grief re-entering the park. We found that come 5pm or so the park clears out and all of a sudden it takes all of 5 mins to get on a ride. I spent the next couple of hours taking advantage of checking out all the rides as many times as I could.Bottom line - Great day out and well worth the visit.

review_456914226,“Awesome experience”,"We ultimately ended up buying annual pass to USS. The rides are awesome and thrilling. Best rides are cylone, transformer, galactica and mummy. Usually the queue is long and might take time to take ride on any given weekend. But the trick is to keep thrilling rides until late afternoon when the crowd starts to thin down and disperse. Till then enjoy regular shows, madagascar, shrek, jurassic park.

They pick you up at 8:30am when the park doesn't open till 10am as they stop lots to pick people up and just sit for a while in a car park. Better to get a bit longer sleep and just go there directly. Some of the movies/themes are a bit outdated now like battlestar galactica and waterworld.

review_456779765,“The better Disneyland!”,"Filled with roller coasters, shows, shops and more, I absolutely love Universal Studios. My personal favourites from my last visit includes Spielberg's Lights Camera Action, the Guinness World Record Lights display, and the Transformers Ride (name). Starting with Spielberg's Lights Camera Action show, I love the way they compress the complex process of movie special effects into ten minutes. From the small details such as the sound of rain tapping at the side, to the large fiery explosion engulfing the set, the ten minute spectacle is certainly worth watching for anyone who has watched a movie, just for an idea of how it's done. Then the lights display.

review_456657966,“How to get your money's worth at USS”,"Enough has been said about the rides and attractions at USS so let me know just give you some tips on how to get there, where to store your backpack, how to save money, where to eat and other hacks. GETTING THERE:* We took a cab to Sentosa Island on our first day, While chatting with the cab driver, he used the phrase ""everything is money my friend"" which I experienced firsthand. From your research you might already arrived at a conclusion that getting inside sentosa involves an entry fee either through Sentosa Express (SGD4), taxi (SGD2-6, based on time of entry) or own car. But there is another option for people to enter Sentosa Island without paying anything. Yeah, you guessed it right, its the SENTOSA BOARDWALK. Situated at Level 1 of Vivo City mall, this 500m boardwalk take you to Sentosa Island free of charge and hey, you don't have to walk. Just take the travelator and enjoy the scenery en route. The boardwalk is free of cost upto 31st Dec'17. Its funny how you cannot see a single signboard pointing towards the boardwalk entry point. Get to L1 of Vivo City Mall and pass by the Tung Lok Signatures restaurant to get to the boardwalk.DRINKING WATER* Always carry an bottle with you to avoid purchase of water bottles at extra cost. All the rides have drinking water fountains to fill up on water. This applies to entire Singapore for that matter. We never purchased a bottle of water anywhere during our stay.FREE LOCKERS FOR YOU BACKPACK* You might have come across numerous posts advising you not to carry a backpack in USS since it might be a burden to carry around. Well, who DOESNT need a backpack right? I mean where are you going to store you towels, selfie sticks, change of clothes and snacks (shhhhhhhhh, you might get lucky if you play your cards right ;) )The trick is to keep the weight of the backpack to the bare minimum and use he free lockers available at some places. * There are free backpack storage places but they do come with a catch. They are free for only 45minutes after which you need to pay SGD4. However, there is no limit to the number of times you use the free lockers. All you need to do is check the waiting time for the ride and store the bags accordingly. There is a locker space available in Ancient Egypt section, where you can find the Revenge of the Mummy one of the best rides in USS. Also, it is close to The Lost World (Jurassic Park) where you can hop on the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, another awesome ride. Trick is to find the free locker spaces and use them wisely cos you only need one person to hold your space for the ride, if you catch my drift ;)PONCHO* Weather conditions are as unpredictable as the US Presidential Elections. It might rain anytime, anywhere. You just need to be equipped enough to face it and take advantage of it. Yes, I meant take advantage of it because people don't venture in rain, duh. That is where having a poncho can come to your rescue. Ponchos nothing but plastic raincoats made of thin material which serves its purpose at a much cheaper cost than purchasing an umbrella at USS @ USD10, ONLY. Ponchos are available at 2 for SGD5. You just need to ask for those.FOOD @ USS* Numerous restaurants and food carts are available inside USS but the prices come to an average of SGD10 if you want to purchase anything. It is mentioned clearly that outside food/snacks are not allowed inside but they do not check you bags inside out. They just ask you to open up and show the items inside. So it is up to you to purchase food/snacks/drinks inside USS or sneak some inside *wink wink*TIPS:1. Finish all the popular rides like Battle Star Galactica (sci-fi city, roller coaster), Revenge of the Mummy (Ancient Egypt), Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure and Canopy Flyer (The Lost World), during the lunch break when the waiting times are less. 2. Checkout the timings of shows like Waterwold (The Lost World), Sesame Street (New York) and be there ahead of time to beat the queue.3. Try to plan your visit during the middle of the week like Tues, Wed. Waiting time might climb to even 90minutes during peak season and public holidays.4. Get a Universal Express entry pass if you want to beat the line, not applicable only for a few rides.If you research and plan your trip to USS properly, you can get the maximum out it. Definitely would recommend to everyone across different age groups.

I first tried Transformers since it's indoor, and then I tried Battlestar Galactica Human, it was not really scary as I thought. If you want more extreme you should try Cylon one. The revenge of the mummy was a really nive experience because you ride roller coaster indoor and dark. it was really good.

review_456620861,“Fun filled family day - Sad about the rain!”,"We had a great time at Universal Studios Singapore. It was fun rides for the whole family, great food and loads to see and explore. It was a bit humid and warm on arrival but this soon changed as we were about 1/4 into the park. It started raining...more like pouring down with thunder galore. This was such a pity because the whole park comes to a standstill and all except 2-3 rides stop working if there is thunder accompanying the rain. Luckily we went prepared with some ponchos in our bags, but even this was not enough for the down pouring because we were walking around in water about ankle high. We ultimately missed about 2-3 hours in our day just standing around under shelter waiting for the rain to subside which eventually did but because there was still thunder warnings the park remained to close the rides. I would def visit this park again, I would just plan to miss the rain and go on a sunny day. But seeing that Singapore has rain pretty much everyday I don't know why the creators didn't plan for the park to be more equipped to function in the rain or accommodate their visitors. We flew into Singapore and only had the one day to make Universal Studios work, so sad for us. And you pay quite a bit for tickets, so again...make it work for the visitors and instead having 80% of the park under rain and only 20% under roof in a tropical place with rain all the time....the math is a bit off I should say. It just leaves sad faces on kids that had been excited for this visit for weeks. What did save us was the booking of tickets online and the express passes. We only bought the package allowing one express pass and this helped us getting most of the rides in once the park opened fully again. The ques were endless since it was over peak season. So well worth the extra couple of bucks paid. We had our 5, 10, 16 yrs old boys with us. Got some great shots to remember and relived some of the family favorite movies!!

We started from the entrance then went left for kids at far far away land then jerrasic park land then Egypt lands then sci fic where transformers are, in between them both lovely roller coasters very fast, then we ended at new York lands, for more fun i advice you at the entrance to buy the fast track where its very very useful we couldn't finish all zones at one day without it.. each ride that takes 45 m waiting line it took us 5 min to ride .. plus if you are single you can also use the fast track express as a single rider in most rides. Water lands opens at 3 pm .. also look at the schedule of the shows and try to catch up especially in new york the dancing band are very good. I didnt buy anything from stores to not carry many toys and gifts because the universal store at the gate have almost everything and every character u will see inside, so i bought when i was leaving just next to the gate, out side you can find some nice restaurants for dinner.

On the way in, we asked about the price of ""fast pass"" tickets and it was 80 dollars each. Quite expensive on top of tickets, so had a think about it. Within ten minutes of asking the price, we went to buy them, only to be told they were now 100 dollars each! Unbelievable, but apparently this is normal practice. If the place is busy, they hike up the price. Absolutely disgraceful! Have been to Universal studios in other countries, have never known this happen.

review_456306177,“Fun times and short lines but don't forget a poncho!”,"This is a manageable sized theme park that requires all day to see! Went on a rainy weekday (albeit in school holidays for Chinese New Year) which meant it was a bit quieter, but they do close the outdoor rollercoasters when lightning in the vicinity so pick your day carefully. The lines were not that long (our longest wait was 40 mins for the river rapids ride) on average 20 minutes. There aren't that many rides and many of them are more suited to younger kids. Only about four or five thrill seeking ones. Our favourite rides were the Mummy Underground Rollercoaster and the Transformers 4D ride. The river rapids ride was good got drenched (forgot the poncho!) but they had drying pods for $5. I could see how there could be long queues at busy times. My top tip, if you can manage it wait until the end of the day... no lines at all for the last hour before closing time! A must do on Sentosa

review_456304053,“Interesting ”,"We visited universal studios on a Tuesday, it was quite busy as it was the week following Chinese New Year. The entry staff and staff on most attractions were lovely, very helpful and cheerful, although came across a few moody ones! We got unlimited express tickets so we skip all the ques straight to he front which was definitely worth it! Some ques were over 2 hours long! Although around 3 rides didn't have express lines available which was annoying as we paid so much money for these tickets. We watched waterworld performance which was amazing! Although they didn't announce you couldn't use phones/take photos and the person in front of us got told off then asked to leave for having her phone out, which was rude of the universal worker. I understand how the show should be kept a secret so it's unspoilt for new customers, although if you go on YouTube there's the whole performance on video anyway. The bigger rides, mummy and transformers were my favourite! Some of the others were boring but I guess that's my personal preference. Food was very expensive onsite but you could leave and re enter the park as many times within the day you've paid so we went outside had lunch that came back into the park. I must say overall a very good day, filled with lots of fun! If you go outside universal and head straight it goes to a river at 8pm there is a crane performance, two birds which fall in love and there's fireworks etc, it's very pretty! Overall a really good day!

It all started when we entered the park and found that dreamy Minions mart. We wanted to stay there forever! We started with the Sci-Fi City which had the thrilling Transformers ride which is the 1st of its kind in the world. Bumblebee was there when we got outside & it was such a pleasure meeting it in person! Lost world had some Jurassic Park fantastic rides, especially the Rapids ride. Ancient Egypt was nice but we didn't have much time to try its rides. Then we headed to Far Far Away which had funny Shrek 4D adventure & the cool Donkey show. In addition, Madagascar was amazing and the Crate adventure was supreme! It was a very special moment when we met the MINIONS at 6 PM and took memorable photos with them. Also the park had great cafeterias and cafes which served nice cold drinks & snacks. Universal Studios Singapore was one hell of an adventure and we'll be back again for sure one day.

Definitely invest in a quick pass if it's a crowded day, we didn't need it whilst we were there because the lines were 20min at the most, however, we witnessed those who benefitted from it.This is a smaller universal studios than USA but we quite liked it.The food here was really bad, the Asian food court laksa as terrible, so too was the hot Milo (definitely need more Milo in it so watery), the waffle place was not so nice too.

Finally got to ride on the Battle-star Galactic roller coaster both of them as there were in service. Well they were worth the wait and the fourth attempt to ride them as they have been out of order and all previous visits. The rest of the park was great especially the Mummy ride which we did 3 consecutive times in a row with no wait at all straight after the other 2 roller coaster rides.The queue at the Jurassic Rapids Adventure was massive about 1 - 1 1/2 hour long. Mean while we got straight into the Shrek movie with no waiting. All in all a great day out for the whole family. A few points to remember:It very hot from 10.30 - 4 so wear your sunscreen and definitely a hat.Drink lots of water.No need for a poncho, really on a water ride? ""You might get wet the signs say"" - uh you are going on a water ride people, just get a bit wet.The water world show is worth seeing, if not to just sit down for a while and rest in the shade.The Express pass is probably worth investing in if you don't like queues, although its about $40. We would have only used it only 3 rides so for us not worth the extra money.Get there Early around 10am when the park opens and spend 4 or 5 hours there straight. Don't eat the food at the park and have lunch back the the shopping center where you join the mono rail to get there.

Kiddie rides (well what I feel should be for kids only) such as Seasame Street, Treasure Hunters, Dino Flyer and Madagascar Carasol has hundreds of adults without children riding on them which means that kids have to wait in long lines to enable them to enjoy the rides.We love USS and will definitely be back just not on a holiday again

There are numerous attractions, good joints, there is a parade too. Lots of shipping options. Bit go on a weekday so that u don't face a crowded park and can cover everything in one day.

review_455347635,“Fun! Expensive! Small!”,"All in all, I've been to this park several times in a year. Twice for Halloween Horror Nights and multiple times on a regular day. I suggest buying the fast past if you're going on the weekend because the cues are not worth the wait. I also suggest in bringing ponchos if you're going to do the Jurassic world. Remember to bring a water bottle so you don't have to pay for the bottled ones. You can refill them at the fountains.

review_455340163,“Fantastic fun filled day”,"Fantastic day, fun for all ages and all levels of thrill seekers. We paid for the express pass which allows one time express queue for each ride. That was money well spent as the longest we waited for a ride was about 10 minutes when the wait times were 1 hour for the popular rides. All the rides were great my favourites were the Transformer, both Battlestar Galactic rides and for a bit less hectic the Jurassic Rapids Adventure. The shows like Lights Camera Action were great. Unfortunately we missed the WaterWorld show as the last show starts at 1 pm, so I would make that a priority to get there early as only 2 shows a day. We left at 7 pm when they closed the gates, 8 hours of absolute fun.

review_455291648,“First timers at Universal”,"We visited Universal Singapore on a wet rainy Monday mid morning. When we arrived lots of rides were closed due to technical issues, rain issues or just not working. We nearly walked back out again and wanted to demand our money back! But after the rain held off, things slowly started to open up again. Top rides for our kids were Transformer ride and the Jurassic Park water rapid ride. Top rides for adults were Revenge of the Mummy and Battle Star Galactica. Best for young kids is Shrek 4-D experience, the gentle rides in Jurassic park and walking around Hollywood. We ended up spending 6hrs there and that was sufficient as we were lucky there weren't too many long queues. Our max waiting time was 30mins.

review_454680736,“A great day out but...!”,"There's plenty to like about Universal Studios on Sentosa Island, beginning with the very scenic location, but there are also some shortcomings.First of all it must be said that the grounds are very well maintained and the presentation is first class. I suggest an Express Pass is essential if you hope to catch a reasonable amount of rides and attractions. Some people waited in excess of one hour for entry to a ride, where-as with our passes our longest wait was about 15 minutes. The rides themselves were pretty spectacular but the WaterWorld show made me cringe. Plenty of bangs, smoke and overdone American bravado, but frankly it was kindergarten playtime. Couldn't wait for it to end but I was clearly in the minority in this regard. I'd suggest job satisfaction is not high at Universal, the staff carry out their duties with little sign of interest and frankly, appear pretty bored with their lot.Our greatest disappointment came with the outrageous prices they charge for food and drinks. $50 for a pizza and $6 for a machine made coffee. That's not a typo... $50 for a pizza worth no more than $15. So, a great day out but...!

review_454602435,“Great day”,"Booked and printed tickets online prior to heading out. Getting there - so cheap and easy to get a taxi out to Sentosa. Line took about 10 minutes once gates were opened. Pretty good compared to elsewhere in the world. They are very strict about bringing in your own food etc...As has been mentioned plenty of times a Express Pass is an absolute must for this place. The park was not that busy the day we went but the Express Pass probably saved us about 2 hours of queuing. On a busy day I think it would save at least 4 hours, more likely 6.We loved the rides. Our kids are 11, 9 and 6. I think this is really the sweet spot for this place. Older teenagers would probably be fairly unimpressed with the level of thrills on the rides. But for us it was perfect. Good size park. Plenty to do. Highly recommended.A hassle getting off Sentosa with taxi queue taking about 40 minutes.

review_454597720,“Worth doing if you want to say you have been to Universal Singapore”,"Typically Universal. The street scape, the music, the characters. They are all here for you to enjoy. The only criticism I would make is that the queue length timers were not updated at all correctly on the day we went along. The kids went to ride on the Human Battlestar Galactica ride when the queue length said 10 minutes. They emerged from the ride over an hour later. This ruined most of the day as we missed some attractions.

There are so many things to do that initially you feel that one day will not be enough but you can manage to do everything with some luck and planning.There are attractions for everyone from young toddlers to someone who's looking for hard core roller coaster ride.Advice: If you are visiting during holiday season it is advisable to buy express pass that helps reducing the waiting time drastically. The express pass fee changes as per the no of people expected to visit and ranges anywhere between 40-80 SGD. But its worth it.

review_454409483,“A full on day with attractions for all ages”,"We were a little worried that Universal Studios Singapore would be geared more towards young children rather than adults - but happily we were wrong.There were several lands / zones, most with a mixture of things for children and adults to do.We have already visited Universal Studios Hollywood - some of the rides appeared to be replicated. Jurassic Park and The Mummy were similar to the Hollywood rides, but not the same, so it's worth having another go. The transformers ride is the same - but I loved it the first time, and loved it just as much the second. Battlestar Galactica was a huge hit - without giving it away it's our suggestion that you do both sides of the roller coaster and start with ""human"".Some things that are good to know:• There is a compulsory bag check at the gate, you cannot take outside food into the park• You cannot film or take pictures on any of the rides except the Madagascar boat ride - this is different to the LA park where they even encouraged it and took photos for you• You will be able to tell pretty quickly if you need the ""express pass"" we had a 40 minute wait for our first ride and we were there at opening, so we promptly purchased the express pass. The wait for the Battlestar Galactica ride was 100 minutes, the Jurassic Park boat ride was 100 minutes and The Mummy was 45 minutes • You get extremely wet on the Jurassic Park ride - particularly your footwear• Many of the rides do not allow you to take ANYTHING on, in fact the have metal detectors on the line... so if it's one of those rides stow your belongings in a locker before approaching the line, save yourself some time• We arrived at 10am and with the express park got through all the attractions we wanted to visit by 4pm - there is a lot to see, it's a big day• Same system with the photography as the Hollywood park, you get your barcode card on your first photo and take it with you, there are several photo points in the park. Some rides are unattended so you need to write down the number or take a photo to add it to your account at the end when you check out• There is NO studio tourWe had a great day and would recommend the park - particularly the Battlestar Galactica roller coasters We were able to secure our tickets through the website ""Voyagin"" for a discounted price, so check that out, it makes the ""express pass"" a little more financially viable.Santosa Island is accessible via the Vivo shopping complex on the #10 bus run or the Yellow train line. You can walk the boardwalk (with travelators) for free or catch the monorail for $4 (which you can use your ezy-link card for).

review_454406877,“The teenager in all of you will love this!”,"This is a rides based theme park loosely based on a number of Universal Studio's movies. From merry go rounds to roller coasters this park ticks all the boxes but will especially appeal to teenagers with a lot of high-speed activities where you get shaken about and rolled upside down. For parents with young children be aware that a lot of the attractions have minimum height and weight restrictions. For the elderly, how adventurous do you feel? Oh and there's always Shrek.

The park opens at 10 be there earlier to get tickets of you didn't purchase online.2. They currently have a MasterCard promotion you get 10% off? and a $5meal voucher if you pay using a MasterCard. 3. Buy your express pass. 4. Assuming you got they're early the cues are short, goto sci-fi world and ride the two big rollercoasters (battle star galactic) there without using your express pass. You can't have anything in your pockets, there are lockers there which are free for 45mins. If the transformers ride had a short cue do the same.5. The mummy / Egyptian ride opens at 11. So go there next. Again if the cue is short save your express pass so you can use it later.6. Go and do the rest of the park. Come back to transformers, the battle star galactic rides and the mummy.7. We went mid week, was quiet but we zipped though cues. The park is really well laid out, its very small but you can easily do it in a day. Food is really expensive and average quality. The shopping center that you get the train to sentosa has much better options but you will need to leave the park. If there is lighting storms they will close the battle star galactic rides due to safety.

The best part is all attractions are included in your admission ticket.No extras. in case you have time visit Universal Studios only on a week day if you wish to enjoy it fully. On saturdays/sundays and holidays the waiting period at each attraction could be 45-60 mins.All attractions are of high technology to give you a very wonderful and satisfying experience. It also lets you peep into cultures and history of different continents. The architecture inside is a treat to the eyes with dummy shops, theaters, cinema halls etc. to give you a STREET feeling.

review_452907465,“Excellent experience”,"The amusement park itself is not going to thought only ride there and back by cable car. But this ""round-trip"" had to lay the whole day! There are several stations, each very interesting, you can go out for a walk indefinitely. The entrance fee is not necessary to the park. there is even a manmade islands and sandy beach! Very unusual and interesting! It is a pity that it is not taken for this whole day, it was possible to change the day at the zoo for a day on the cable car. Most liked the Mummy, Transformers and 2 large twisted slides (on one leg standing on the bottom of the booth, on the other - are hanging in the air, the second worse) show Spielberg.Show Water World seemed more aggressive and prolonged, with Shrek Movies - the movie funny, but the long and boring to stand in the ""waiting room"", is telling.Jurassic Period - the most popular attraction, judging from the queue; think about whether you need to go. Nothing special, but at the end of those who are not fortunate to be completely doused with water. We are not lucky my daughter and one man, the daughter was completely (completely full) wet, I was partially wet clothes and shoes completely wet.No hair dryers, which are outside (though badly paid - $ 2 for a few minutes drying) did not change the situation even by 1%.

They only came out once every few hours. If you got to the line a little late, bad luck. There was a shut off and you miss out. Try and explain that to your child!

review_452561175,“Perfectly Managed”,"Visited this theme park in December 2016. Well managed. Waiting times not too long. My son took an express pass and finished most of the rides in good time. Was very impressed that this theme park had well signed Halal restaurants. This was helpful. Also was very impressed that was a well marked prayer area in the park. This too was helpful. Overall a very impressive visit. Very comparable to Orlando.

review_452542809,“Don't go: Singapore's biggest rip off”,"We had the most expensive bad day out at USS. The service is shocking. We got there early, queued 90 minutes anyway for 'Transformers', to be turned away by a loudspeaker announcement that it had broken down. There was no information about waiting times in the queue and not a staff member in sight, even when it had broken down. No explanation, no apology, no fast pass for later, nothing. So, we moved on to Jurassic World, by this time it was 12 noon. We were told the queue was under 1 hr, so we were happy we would make it to the Waterworld show at 1.30. The queue was actually 90 minutes, the ride nothing special, and we missed the show. We went on a couple of the no-queue rides appropriate for nervous grannies just to do something, then left (after the world's worst hot dog). For our family of 5 this joy cost us $320. Please no one chip in and suggest we should have paid an extra $150 for express passes - this was not in our budget. We have been to theme parks before and don't mind queuing for some rides, but at USS it was totally impossible to get our money's worth. Bear in mind that for our first 3.5 hours in the park the only thing we had done was stand in hot queues. Don't go. Avoid making your kids aware of the existence of USS (mine completely agreed it was rubbish). Singapore has loads of other lovely things to do: save the theme parks for the US or Eurodisney.

review_452524036,“An anniversary well spent”,"Visited USS on our anniversary, and cant say it wasnt a wise decision. Took a cab n reached early by 9.30. But found out that we could have saved 33 sgd on each ticket and avoided the que, if we would have booked online. But regardless, Even for 74 sgd per person, it was worth every penny. N to top it all, we also caught a glimpse of the christmas special shows. Make sure to carry your own sipper or bottle, else you'll end up spending a lot on water n drinks. Also keep an extra pair of clothes, as your existing one's might get wet in the waterworld show and ride.

The attractions were of an outstanding quality, surprisingly, the best ride isn't a conventional roller coaster - its the 3D transformers ride - give it a go! During busy periods, the fast track is definitely recommended to get the most out of the park.The water world show was impressive too!

review_452510733,“Easy to reach and travel inside. Good fun for kids. Rides are so-so. Plan your day ahead.”,"Very easy to reach either by taxi or public transport. Taxi/uber/grab preferred - there may be charges on car and cab entrance on some days. Do plan your day ahead as doing all rides in one day may not be possible. Can get very crowded, hence wait times at major rides may be 2 hours+. Rides are comparatively easy. I would suggest doing the whole Sentosa. Take tickets online (from sites such as klook) to save time - just scan the barcode for entry. Do not take the Jeep safari - complete let down.

review_452325285,“Fun but tiring day put”,"Make sure you come wearing comfy shoes and bring lots of water as there will be queues to wait for the rides. We arrived at 9.30am and left at 6.30pm. Plenty to keep us busy all day. The single rider lanes were excellent as they save you lots of time queueing at some rides. Make sure you go to the popular rides first e.g. Jurassic park river ride, Egyptian mummy ride, battle star gala to a roller coasters. These were very good. If you can afford a fast pass then that is the way to go. Fun for teenagers and parents alike. Will cost you about $15-20 each for lunch. Drink and a fish sandwich, chicken wrap etc . You will get wet on some of the rides. If you have a rain poncho then bring it. Fun day for all.

review_452306805,“Great place and guaranteed fun”,"Universal Studios is an obvious attraction in Singapore. So, it is big on the agenda. Plus the added attraction of it being situated @ Sentosa Island, a complete entertainment and tourist zone of Singapore. On top of that, it's an island. So, the anticipation and expectation are more.And must say it lives up to its name. It has zones like Hollywood, New York, Sci-Fi city, Ancient Egypt, Lost World, Far Far Away and Madagascar. Most of the rides are very nice and some of them are overhyped. I will give a review of all the rides that we experienced followed by tips/observations. But, must say it is a relatively smaller amusement park compared to say Disneyland and Ocean's Park @ Hongkong. In terms of concept, it is quite similar to Disneyland. In a nutshell, it is somewhere between Disneyland and Ocean's Park. Comparable to Ocean's Park in terms of adrenalin led rides and to Disneyland in terms of the wow factor associated with movies and movie characters.Review of rides:1. Transformers The Ride (Sci-Fi City) - the best one in Universal Studios. Please go for this. It is a thrilling experience where around 8 people are put on a car and then you are taken through a battle between the Autobots and Decepticons. Even kids of 5-6 years of age can attend. My daughter (6 yrs.) thoroughly enjoyed. So, this should be your first ride. 2. Human vs. Cylon (Sci-Fi City) - the zig-zagging roller coaster. I think Human is the red one and Cylon is the grey one. I went for the latter which looked more dangerous and in which you are hanging from the top. In Human, you are sitting on top. That's the difference. I think Cylon has more dangerous flips, turns, etc. And I thoroughly enjoyed it. So, people who love roller coaster, please go for this.3. Revenge of the Mummy (Ancient Egypt) - a very interesting roller coaster which mostly operates in the dark with sudden drops, fire, sound, etc. I think small kids will be scared of this. Since it is mostly in the dark, there is a sense of anticipation and fear of the unknown. And in one particular moment, from a brief stationary situation, suddenly the ride car plunges down in the dark. Most thrilling. Please go for this if you like fear of the unknown!!4. Canopy Flyer (Lost World) - very nice ride on a reduced speed roller coaster. Great to go with kids.5. Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (Lost World) - very thrilling. And you might be warned of getting wet. Well, trust me, you do have chances of getting wet, but it is not so much. So, don't bother to put your bags in the locker (on rent) or buy ponchos while entering. Not necessary. You are made to sit on a rubber inflated dingy kind of a thing which goes through rapids amongst dinosaurs, etc. All of us enjoyed a lot including my 6-year-old daughter.6. Puss in Boots' Giant Journey (Far Far Away) - Again a roller coaster which both my daughters (6 yrs and 14 years) enjoyed. 7. Shrek 4D Adventure (Far Far Away) - over hyped for sure. It is one of those typical air being blown on your backs and water being sprayed while you watch in 3D Shrek and Donkey on an adventure. Before you go to the main hall, there is this boring lecture of the adventure you are about to take. We found it a complete waste of time.8. Madagascar: A Crate Adventure - the most boring boat ride on earth. Please avoidTips/observations/things to watch out for:1. How to reach using public transport - The best way is to reach Harbour Front MRT on the North East Line and the Circle Line. From there you walk through VivoCity Mall to reach the Sentosa Express station which is located right on top of VivoCity Mall. Just keep taking the escalator up to reach the station from where Sentosa Express starts which is a monorail. In 5 minutes, you cross the short stretch of sea between mainland Singapore and Sentosa Island to reach Waterfront station which is where Universal Studios and S.A. Aquarium are located. 2. The park opens at 10 am and we went on a weekday when there was not too much of rush. The first thing to do is to rush for Transformers ride so that you don't get a queue later. We didn't get any queue yet it took us almost 15 minutes to get onto the ride. So, you can imagine if there is a queue. If you have online tickets, straight move to the entry gate. Please keep your online ticket print out with you because if you move out of the park and want to come back they require the online ticket print out once again in addition to some invisible mark they put on your arms.3. Duration of stay - if you spend time from 10 am to 5 pm its more than enough. You can enjoy most of the worthwhile rides, see most of the shows held at designated times, have a relaxed lunch and explore the whole park without any rush. I feel even if you have half a day, it is enough. Please go on a weekday as there is not too much of a rush and you will not need the premium pass or band for the rides. Maximum waiting time for each ride will be 20 minutes. We started at 10 am and were there till 1.30 pm post which we walked down to S.A. Aquarium (which is right next door) and spent around 2 hours there. We then came back to Universal Studios at around 4 pm. Then we were there till around 6 pm. We then moved on to explore other parts of Sentosa Island like Merlion statue (at Imbiah station) and the Wings of Life show (at Beach Station) which was out of the world. So, if you are going for the full day to Sentosa, please remember to keep enough time for other stuff there and not spend too much time at Universal Studios.4. Where to eat - I would strongly recommend the grilled chicken at Goldilocks restaurant (indoor and outdoor) and also followed by their signature ice cream collection. I read about the grilled chicken in TA and I must thank that soul who recommended that. The grilled chicken is simply too good. Please don't miss it. Kids will enjoy too.5. Necessary to carry - water bottles are a must which you will need to keep refilling from time to time. People sensitive to heat and sunlight please carry umbrellas because the heat and sunlight can be quite strong. You get strollers for kids there so take one if you have a complaining kid who doesn't like to walk. Please pick up a park map before entering so that at least you can locate Transformers ride before anything else!!6. Where to book tickets - I would strongly recommend booking through klook. You get the maximum discount which is more than voyagin which is the other one which gives a good discount. And you will have no issues with klook at least which I used.7. The Minion store - please visit the Minion store @ Hollywood area (near the entrance). It is a good time pass and has lots of interesting Minion merchandise, which is very expensive, though.To summarise, its a nice place to go with kids. Everybody enjoys here. Though the number of rides and the area is limited compared to other parks. Transformers is the ride here which must be experienced. The fact that Universal Studios is located at Sentosa Island makes it even more unique. Don't forget to click that must have photograph in front of the Universal Studios globe model right at the entrance! One must plan a full day @ Sentosa Island from morning 10 am till night 10 pm. There are lots of things to see, do and experience. Sentosa Island is really awesome!!

review_452295466,“Express Pass Required”,"Great long day at the park, - personally I do not like the whole "" Express Ride Queue Pass"" notion,-of paying more money to go to the front of the queue... but here you do need it... as others have already said , you go straight to the front of the line..instead of waiting for 40 mins for a 40 second ride. It is just too hot/humid for that.., if your not used to the humidity...we took in our own food and water... but there were plenty of taps there which was good. Depending on your skin type- sun screen is a must! We did buy some food- price was what you would expect at a park like this one, but the kids where surprised to see a Pizza for $50!!

review_451599969,“A good all day experience ”,"Definitely one of the best value attractions in Singapore! We went at about 11am and stayed for a good few hours, although it was a bit confusing getting into Sentosa and then getting tickets into the park. You need to buy a Sentosa monorail ticket to get into the island - the ticket que can be long but hardly anyone was using the automated ticket machines. We used the machines without issue. The ticket cost 4SGD. Universal is at the first stop of the monorail and a short walk from the station. When you get to the ticketing booth, spend that little bit extra and get the ""universal express"" pass. We skipped the que at all the rides and easily saved at least 30-60 minutes at each ride. Definitely worth the extra money. The best rides were the battlestar galactica roller coaster, return of the mummy coaster and the Jurassic park water rapids ride. You will get wet with the water rides. All in all it was a great experience and would definitely come again.

Subtle but noticeable for anyone whose been here numerous times.The update in the Transformers ride is great, especially with the smoke machine. The ambience is so much better!Maintenance in Madagascar made the ride so much better. The new audio clips too.The rapids, you guys, I could kiss you! The rapids used to be a little slow and than in the tunnel it picked up, but now! Wow wow wow. Crazy speeds in the rapids. Definitely, this is Universal Studios! The tides and waves with the new speed is awesome.Still disappointed that the canopy has no express queue. Bring it back! Why was it removed in the first place. Ugh.Shrek was not so great. Sat on the right on the 2nd row and we were hardly moving. No wind from the back, no spiders on our legs. Boo.The people mending the exit were so sour.

If you can shell out an extra S$60 per person for the express pass, that's great. Otherwise, be prepared to foot-numbing waiting times of up to 90 minutes for the popular rides. We used the single rider option to have a go on 3-4 rides. Felt good to get on a ride within 5 minutes when people had been waiting for one and a half hours! Most rides at USS seemed unsuitable for very young kids - HongKong Disneyland is probably a better bet for families with toddlers. My 9-year-old was disappointed because there was nothing Harry Potter here. But overall, not a bad way to spend the day if you enjoy theme parks in general. The 1.5 hour wait for a taxi back to the hotel was the most unpleasant part of our experience.

review_450929940,“A must visit”,"If this is your time time to Singapore, you need to visit the Universal Studio. The entire park can be covered within 3 to 5 hours. The transformer ride is one of the best. The jurassic park ride pales in comparison with Osaka's Universal Studio because it is a much smaller park. The set up for the mummies ride from the entrance and all the way to the ride itself is very well developed. A favourite tourist spot.

review_450921745,“Great experience”,"I was on a 20-hour layover in Singapore. It's certainly a step-up from British theme parks in terms of overall atmosphere; it has several excellent rides but maybe not the depth I wanted. In some ways I wish I'd spent more time exploring the city, so if you've one day in Singapore I'd suggest you don't put your eggs just in this basket.

The Mummy ride we queued for nearly an hour then it closed due to a malfunction and the water ride closed to storms approaching ( Lightning Warning). Did the Transformers 3D ride and Rollercoaster, both of which were great fun. Tip - go on another day, not in the wet season or public holiday - this goes for all attractions in this theme park such as Waterworld and the Aquarium.

review_450895567,“VIP Tour Experience a Must Do!”,"A first time visit to Universal Studios in Singapore and with only a day to do it. We decided to spend the extra and book the VIP Tour. We were a bit hesitant at first as we generally like to see attractions at our own pace.We are so glad we did. We booked directly online and not through the many travel agents advertising the same. We saved money doing so, but was still $268.00 per person. For this we got our ticket, express pass, which enabled you to skip the lines after the tour finished, access to the VIP lounge, and a dedicated tour guide for 6 hrs. You also get a lunch voucher for $25.00 each and 10% discount at food stores and clothing outlets. Jethro was our guide, he was excellent and really enjoyed taking us around. He planned out what we wanted to do for the day and made sure we saw everything we wanted. He gave us behind the scenes tours and explained all the rides and shows. There were VIP areas for the shows and we didn't have to wait for any rides. We could also ride as many times as we liked.It was a great day and experience and something we would do again. Well worth the investment for what you got.

review_450878717,“Worth doing in one day!”,"US can be done in only one day and we made it! But you need to be smart on how to approach the studio and you have to know things in advance to be effective. I will try to summarize how, in my personal opinion, one can enjoy and see as much as possible in one day. 1) I start with the ‘better not to’: - as soon as you get in, taking pictures and souvenirs (will have time at the end). Need to go to attractions first to avoid queuing - wear trainers and sneakers (can get wet in the Jurassic Park Rapids) 2) ‘Better to’ list: - Buy the tickets on-line!!!!! The print-at-home function will give you immediate access into the park without needing to stop at a ticket counter (a lot of time saved). - Bring your own bottles of water. You can refill them there. - Bring snacks/food if you can. This will help you to avoid the humongous queues during lunchtime (from 11.30 to 1.30) and you can go to do some of the attractions whilst the other people are eating. - Have ponchos at home? Bring them! This will avoid you to buy one for the Jurassic park Adventure or for the Waterworld show. If you haven’t them, go and buy them at the USS store BEFORE hand. Otherwise you will end up doing what most people do: buying them whilst queuing or not buying them at all because you don’t have cash or you left your back pack in one of the storage areas. - Wear flip flops! We also brought a change of clothing. Just to be on the safe side. - Hats and sunscreen will be helpful too - Check promotions and events on their website – unfortunately I cannot post the link here for your convenience, otherwise they reject my review....already happened once.......3) order of attractions (queue based). Some of the attractions can reach up to 2 hours of queue, so better beat the crowd and do them at the beginning! - Transformers the ride - Battlestar Galactica Human & Cylon (the queue here is not that bad, but I would do it now just because after lunch it could be a little bit too much for your stomach…..) - Jurassic park rapids adventure - Canopy flyer - Treasure hunters - Shrek 4D adventure - Madagascar : a crate adventure - Revenge of the mummy Once you have done these ones, go ahead and enjoy other shows/attractions that you like the most. Chances are you have saved a couple of hours of queuing ;-)

review_450792192,“AWESOME Theme park!!! MUST GO!”,"We absolutely loved this theme park! We are from NZ and we have nothing that can even compare to this theme park. The rides were fantastic, the park was clean, you felt safe there and there is so much to do and see. We purchased the express pass and this is defiantly great value for money. Lucky for us the queues were not big anyway but the express pass meant we pretty much did not wait for any rides at all. On a busy day you will defiantly want the express pass. Transformers ride was my favourite and I would suggest getting to this ride first! It absolutely bucketed with rain while we were there, this shut down all outdoor rides but there is still plenty to do inside. Rain stopped every now and again which meant we were still able to do the outside rides we wanted to. Definatly give yourself a FULL day as you will need this if the park is busy, I could see the potential for hour long queue delays!

review_450435450,“Must visit!”,"This must be on top of your list if you are a first time SG tourist. Put this in your weekday schedule and start at 10am if you want to avoid the crown and long queues. Weekend or holidays could take you hours to line up for just one ride. Thus, if weekend is inevitable, get the express pass available at any store inside the park. 50sgd per person is worth it! Also, as soon as you enter the park, get a list of show schedule available at the entrance so you can manage and optimize your time inside the park.

review_450386530,“Great Day Out”,"We're in Singapore for a 3 day holiday, and our visit to Universal Studios was the highlight of our trip. Although our son wasn't able to ride many rides since he's a small 4 year old, there was still much for him to enjoy. One of the rides that he was tall enough to ride, I wish he hadn't. The Puss in Boots' Giant Journey was a nice ride, but too fast and scary for our 4 year old. It's a good thing that it was a quick ride. He really enjoyed the Madagascar Crate Adventure, Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase and Treasure Hunters. We weren't able to catch many shows, due to their timings and our schedule, but we did catch The Rockafellas B-boy dancing show. It was awesome. Very entertaining with great dancing. The dancers interact really well with the audience and they deserve all the applause. We had lunch at Mel's Diner and it was just ok. They offer burgers and fries, hotdogs, chicken sandwiches, typical fast food fare that wasn't anything special. I wish we would have chosen a different restaurant , but it didn't ruin our wonderful experience. We'll surely come again once our son is old enough to enjoy more of what the park has to offer!

It is easy to be assessed just by taking the Sentosa Express at Harbourfront station by taking the circle/ north east line from your previous location.

review_450316025,“Great time had by all - Buy the unlimited express pass”,"This was our second visit to Universal and last time the dual rollercoasters were not operating and the puss in boots ride had not been completed. We stayed from opening to closing and invested in the unlimited express passes. This was the best decision we made with waits of up to 80 minutes on the roller coaster at one stage for the normal queue, and only 20 min for express pass holders. Throughout the day this was constant - we were walking past hundreds of people waiting in the regular queue waiting for ages only to jump right on the ride. This allowed us to pick and choose several rides to have numerous turns at. The only down side was the huge cost and poor value of food and beverage outlets. We paid S$6.50 for a water! given no outside food and drinks are allowed (and there are bag checks at the entrance), I find this too much to pay. Additionally, we bought an afternoon snack of fries for S$5 which had about a handful in it. Paying up to S$40 for a t-shirt also left us with a bad taste in our mouths. When comparing to Disneyland Hong Kong, the prices were extraordinarily high and seem to be much higher than the last time we visited 3 years ago.On a positive note, customer safety seems to be critical with staff very professional and welcoming and keeping everyone informed of any delays. Make sure you take enough time to spend there and plan your day around the parades and visits from the characters. Big kids will love the thrill rides of the roller coasters and the Mummy and Transformers ride and little kids have a good selection too.

review_450313928,“Felt like a kid again”,"Recommend getting the express passes, definitely a must to skip the 40 minute plus queues. Recommend getting there before open time and once the gates open go to either of your express pass rides either transformers or the mummy - both good and suitable for children. We managed to get into transformers and the mummy straight away without using our fast pass, so we were able to use these later on in the day to skip the queue. Definitely need a full day to get around all the rides. Had the time of my life! Felt like a kid again all hyped up on sugar and popcorn.

review_450166250,“ Buy the unlimited express pass”,"All in, Universal has a good variety of different rides, and whilst not as good as the parks in Japan and Orlando, it is far better than California. There are 2 fairly extreme roller coasters and an assortment of 4d and less extreme ridesWe visited on Christmas Day and fortunately had prepurchased the tickets (through discount site, Klook) and unlimited express pass ( through the universal site). Doing so was a saving grace. The kids were able to ride their favourites numerous times throughout the day and allowed us to skip queues that had a wait of up to 90 minutes in some cases. Furthermore, there was a pretty substantial electrical storm at 4.00pm which lasted a couple of hours ( a common occurrence In Singapore). Most of the outdoor rides were closed during that time. So if we had not had the passes, it is unlikely that we would have ridden each ride more than once, or even at all during our day there.

review_450080169,“Stupendous”,"Notwithstanding my travel engagements to several parts of the world, I have never visited an amusement park ever ! Universal Studios Singapore was rated #1 amongst all must-see attractions, and being an ardent TripAdvisor follower I decided to take the plunge and purchased 2 Adults and 2 children tickets. The Adult tickets also gave us a complimentary $25 dollar bottle(which was redeemed at the Discovery food centre)- the kids love this, and still continue to cherish their memories. We also purchased the Universal Express Unlimited pass which cost us $80 per head(as we got them online), and wouldn't hesitate to say it was worth every buck. When we arrived at USS, we saw a separate queue that said for VIPs only and wasn't sure if we could use it. However, to our hearts delight the pass was accepted and we zipped past the serpentine queues to get our 'wristbands', including for our kids. This process was followed for almost all the stupendous rides they had, and my spouse concurred upon that it was 'bang for the buck'. I loved the Battlestar Galactica, and felt I signed my own death warrant when I hopped on (took the machine one as the human had a technical fault)- tried to cajole my spouse to take it but of no avail. For some strange reason, the Revenge of the Mummy was also non-operational citing technical issues.We repeated all the rides again thanks to the Unlimited pass we had, and would love to visit this once again.

We had already bought the tickets and express pass and bypassed all the queues entering the park and the rides. Worth the extra money. We did all the thrill rides as soon as we got in. Near some rides they have free lockers for your bags and some rides you cannot have anything in your pockets. They scan you with a metal detector. The lockers are good as they are timed, so you can go on your ride then take your belongings out and then go to the next ride. If you want to have a locker all day you will need to pay for these. Some lockers like the rapids ride didn't have the free lockers so you just need to look around for the free ones near each attraction. The place was so clean and tidy and we had a great day. Expect rain in December so bring a poncho for when this occurs or you can buy them there at $5. On the rapid ride you will need a poncho, there are signs everywhere that you will get wet, but we didn't expect to get so soaked. Shoes, socks, clothing, it was like we went swimming. It was fun and we dried off pretty quickly in the Singapore humidity. It was great. Well worth the effort, but buy tickets in advance together with the express passes

Comes at a price but if with kids whether you do one ride or two please buy it. With kids you cannot do everything in a day so gear up for a cash burn but pace the day and don't tire yourself out.Walkers and strollers are available at a price and take them. It can get hot go be hydrated as against focussing a lot on eating. Plan the day which is Kid centric or adult centric. If you doing the kiddy things make sure that you a map and are on top of what you want to go and where. There are rides, movies and many other things so planning is key. AGAIN DO NOT TRY TO DO TOO MANY THINGS IN A DAY WITH KIDS IN TOW. be kind to them and hence weather check before going there is essential. The restaurants inside universal studios get crowded so ensure that you go but early and eat. Understand the spread of the park to be able to do justice to it better.

review_449122507,“Fab Day ”,"Fab day with my partner. I'd forgotten how much I liked a rollercoaster. It doesn't quite have the magic of Florida but we still had a lovely day. I would recommend allowing yourself a day to get round without rushing. The express pass is well worth the money as we went on a Wednesday in low season and the bigger rollercoasters had 45 min queues most of the day. Only bit I found annoying is that you don't get an express band you have to hold onto your print out all day unless you get unlimited by the looks of it. We took the MRT and then the Sentosa shuttle. Highly recommend this as it's so easy and really quick! It drops you right into resort world and its seconds from the bank.

review_449113342,“Good but could be better”,"Got there early which is advised to maximise the day. Some great rides. Loved transformers 3D and some others. Big rollercoaster required you to put everything in a locker which was free for a short time but if you are delayed by the queue you get charged. There is no alternative as they won't let you queue even with a wallet in your back pocket. Cost us $10 to get locker open after being delayed on ride queuing. Got a fast pass after that. I highly recommend getting one as you enter otherwise it could cost more in locker fines over the day. All in all a good day out. Waterworks show was impressive. Water ride also well worth a visit.

It was a nightmare gaining entry into the venue even with prepurchase. Clearly staff were in over their heads.It was a busy day at the park. Definitely spend the extra money on the fast passes otherwise you may wait in line for a ride for up to an hour.That being said, there is really only two rides worth going on.. Transformers and the roller coaster.

Then after that we did all single rider queues, maximum wait time of 15min. My nephews loved the rides especially the river rise at lost world and transformers. Arrived at 11:30 and left at 9:00pm. If you are happy to go single rider do that instead of paying extra for the express pass.

review_449053671,“Rides and attractions Galore”,"I went with my wife on the day pass entry, which meant longer waits but less costlier. Very amazing layout. I enjoyed the park setting and atmosphere immensely. I was taken aback by the Jurassic park area and how it made me feel like i was in Isla Nublar. The Jurassic park ride was nice but not the best ride in the park and i'll be honest, only the T-Rex looked realistic. I wished that they had the original Jurassic park t-shirt in grey at the shop and it didn't cost S$35, a more reasonable price would have been S$20. My favourite rides would go to the mummy returns, the transformers 4D ride and battlestar galactica. I was in awe of how superb and realistic the transformer ride was, it was so immersive and as if i was part of the action. The Mummy returns was surprising and theatrical indoor rollercoaster with fire effects and smoke, a truly eerie and terrifying ride with unexpected dips and turns. Battlestar Galactica was a very fast ride, i'll be honest i have been on bigger roller-coasters yet none the less it was a good one.I only tried food in the Madagascar pavillion because it was certified Halal, if you are Muslim please eat from restaurants with the certification only. The Biryani with butter chicken and aaloo gobhi (potato cauliflower) curry was alright but not outstanding. I really wish that universal looks into including more halal restaurants.I would suggest taking raincoats along as the weather is unpredictable and rides close because of rain. The park opens at 10am and closes at 9pm so get there on time. Also don't rely on uber or grab getting you there or collecting you.

I feel like the park definitely was more for older kids, not much for my little one - even the shrek castle scared her unfortunately (as I love shrek). It was a really nice park, plenty to see and do. Nice big areas of the streets that are all undercover. We went on the day before New Year's Eve so most of the good rides had a 90minite wait and it was extremely hot, so my husband and 13 yo weren't even willing to wait for that...

review_448851594,“A great day out”,"We had a wonderful day! We decided to not go down the express pass route and were really happy we saved the money. Arrived at opening- went straight to the battlestar galactica ride (5 min queue). This was a good plan as all day this was chocker. The Transformers ride was about a 60 min wait but at the end of the day (after 5.30) there was almost not queue. The Mummy also had very little queue most of the afternoon. The Rapids ride was suspended briefly due to the weather, we decided to try to wait it out and it reopened after about 15 mins. The rides were all good in different ways, loved the shows too. A great day out, that was surprisingly good value for money. Be prepared for sudden downpours and heat, but that doesn't stop the fun. One word of caution.... we tried to book online the night before via the direct USS website (NOT a third party site). When I tried to pay my card would not process, tried again with husband's card, same issue. We were both contacted by the fraud teams at our different banks saying the credit cards have been blocked as ""issues have been raised with that merchant"" (No payment was taken because of this). No idea what that means but would suggest that this route is avoided if you don't want the hassle of your cards being blocked whilst overseas. We ended up paying cash instead.

We had one of our best ever family days out with so many amazing rides and shows. However, buying the Unlimited Express pass was the best decision we made. It meant that we typically waited only a few minutes for any ride and could go on them multiple times versus standard lines that typically had wait times of 60 minutes with some up to 90 minutes. It is an expensive option but worth it on very busy days - particularly with younger children.

Bring camera and plenty of money for snacks, drinks, and other purchases in the stores. Christmas time has special displays and meet Santa (good photo opportunities). One negative side, at busy times the VIP lines can get quite long and cause delays for regular patrons who did not ""pay extra to get let on the rides first"". There were times when there were so many VIP's getting let on that ony a handful of seats remained for those who were queued in the (much longer) non-VIP line. Every time more VIPs would arrive and get priority while the standard queue hardly advanced. Management should look into controlling this. Maybe reserve say a quarter of the seats to VIP and the rest to everybody else, each time the ride runs.

Toddlers; Sesame Street, Madagascar, dinosaurs in the Jurassic area. The first 2 can be scary the first time though. Young kids- the dragon rollercoaster (enchanted castle). Lunch is expensive, Mel's diner appears is the Favourite spot- for the fish sandwich, burgers and hot dogs are great- the chicken sandwich burger is too greasy and nasty :(Expect to pay $14 pp for burger, fries and soda.

review_448012984,“Needs Harry Potter !! ”,"We have been here twice . Once this week and once before 3 yrs ago. In between we've been to Universal in Florida so have been spoilt a bit by Harry Potter ! Our kids are 13 and 11. One is a complete Rollercoaster addict the other is not ! Our youngest was so pleased he was now big enough to ride the Cylon and the Mummy rides and did so many times thanks to the unlimited fast passes we purchased. As a theme park it's not too expensive to get in but the queues were horrendous (most were 70 to 90mins wait) so we were pleased we made the decision to buy the unlimited fast passes but this bumped the price up by $100 pp so instead of a basic price of $238 it was $638 - quite a commitment but worth it in our opinion. Although it would of been better value with Harry Potter (as in Florida) or a few more medium.thrill rides. They also offer an $80 fast pass which allows one fast pass per ride - the extra $20 for unlimited was essential for us as my two just wanted to go on the same rides again and again.It lost a star for me because of the lack of medium rides ( like Transformers and Jurassic park - the only two) There is a lot for younger children.Practically , it's hot so take hats, sunscreen, be prepared to get wet ( the water world show is great) lots of toilets, lots of food outlets (but mostly chips / burgers mixed with asian fast food) and if you have young kids maybe go later so you can stay up later for the light show ( we started at 10am but were shattered by 5pm because of the heat so didn't make it)

(Around 11-am that time) the queue is damn hot , its an outdoor queue, we were struggle coz of the heat.And then after hours then it came our turn the lady guard didnt allowed my youngest son to take the ride, she said that my youngest son couldnt take the ride because he wasnt tall enough, (about 5-7cm short) then i said why didnt they stop us before we enter im the beginning?the lady said ""i dont know, i just do my job"" then i said i waited for hours already , she said "" i dont know, i just do my job"" she just didnt care. What kind of answer is that. My son cried for at least 20 mins because of that. My son later got a fever around 4.30-5pm . Then i brought him back to our hotel at festive.Later in the evening they said that they had a fireworks attractions at the USS, so i decided to go back in to universal studio.We arrived at around 9.00pm then we shop around til around 9.20-9.25pm then my son saw a santa clause photoshoot at the end of the road, in front of the small universal logo decoration, then he said he wanted to take the picture with the santa,I said ok then. We queue , then after our turn , again the santa bodyguard said sorry its time's up. Santa need to rest or go somewhere else, then my son suddenly ran onto the santa while he (the santa) still sat there but ready to go. My son then hug the santa, i take out my phone and thought it would maybe take a second or two just to press the photo button, but unfortunately its really dissapointing that even the santa moved my son away and said ""sorry, time's up.. got to go"" my son cried like crazy, we were all stunned, what is wrong with them?a santa is supposed to cheer the kids, i know he's a fake santa but come on, at least you have to pretend to be like one.Not some kind of a jerk that make kids dreams go away just because maybe the paycheck in only up to 9.30pm SHARP! This trip to USS is really a nightmare for us.

It will save you ages waiting in queues but be realistic when you use them. If its a 10 minute wait just join the line, if you love the ride just go around again.The transformer ride makes me laugh each time, not because its funny but because a middle age bloke isn't supposed to have that much fun, or is he???As I don't like heights and roller coasters I get plenty of opportunities to hold the bags and photo the kids. The faster the ride the keener they are, the hit each coaster a few times each but I manager 3 times on the Transformers, told you its great.The Jurassic ride is fun, just watch what you wear, white or flashy is a risky choice.We find the best value meals are from Friers especially if you can get a seat in the dining hall.We get there at opening and leave when they kick us out.Excellent fun. Just get your express passes.

review_447688083,“Lifetime Experience!!!”,"Everyone was praising so much about this place when I was in Singapore. I thought it's all fake hype before visiting Universal Studios. When I visited this place it blew up our mind. We never had any such experience in our life earlier. Me and my wife had a great time for the whole day. It is a life time experience. We regretted that we did not buy two day pass. My advice is buy 2 day pass so that you can relax and enjoy all the rides without hurry.

review_447658241,“So Much Fun!!”,"The kids loved it here, and we all had fun on the rides. I ended up buying a 6 month pass, as we were there for 2 weeks and it meant that we didn't have to try and cram it all in one day during Christmas. It turned out to be the best decision, as we would come in the early morning for a short visit before it got busy, and then return in the evening when it was quiet again! Great place for some fun, and a good selection of rides and attractions for all ages.

review_447656236,“Should definitely be on your to-do list in Singapore!”,"Lovely way to spend your day. You would need a full-day to cover most of the attractions. We went on a weekend and were unable to cover all the rides due to long queues at most of the rides. We covered Transformers- 4D ride (was my personal favorite), Shrek 3D, Rapids at Jurassic Park, Revenge of the Mummy and a few more. Strictly avoid Battlestar Galactica if you aren't too adventurous. If it's rainy, finish the indoor rides first. Don't forget to visit Hollywood and New York zone. The best part of our visit was that we witnessed fireworks, celebrations and artificial snowfall because it was Christmas eve. Overall, an awesome experience.

review_447621049,“Great family day out and totally recommend express unlimited passes”,"Visited the park yesterday with my family and the only disappointment was that having pre-booked our tickets and unlimited express passes we still had to stand in a line for over half an hour at guest services to collect our tickets, there were only 3 staff available and a very long line.That said, once we were in the park it was fantastic and the express passes were well worth the additional cost as the park was very busy and wait times in the normal lines were about 75 minutes, the longest we waited with the express pass was about 15 minutes which meant we could go on our favourite rides many times. The Waterworld show was also very enjoyable.The park itself is very well maintained and extremely clean with a large variety of food and drinks available and plenty of toilets which is always a bonus!! We stayed there for a ful 12 hours and were exhausted by the end of the day but would thoroughly recommend it as an awesome family day out!!

We bought the 2 day fun pass at Sentosa from the Sentosa website which includes 1 day pass to Universal Studios and the 2nd pass for the other things within Sentosa Island. All of the rides are good and the park is very well maintained. Although it gets a bit tiring at the end of the day but totally worth it.

review_447345329,“Superb family day out!”,"We came to USS for Christmas Day and we were not disappointed! Our daughter is 7 so had no restrictions on any of the rides in the park (height restrictions do apply).The park itself is reasonably small, however there is plenty to do in order to keep you occupied for the whole day.There are rides which span all ages, however I would say they USS is less suitable for really small children. The cost to get in is quite expensive, but Singapore in general is quite expensive no matter what you do! With it being December and the rainy season we would advise you take ponchos with you, however these can be purchased for a fee ($4 each when we went).As expected food is quite expensive here (we paid $30 for 3x hotdogs and fries which were very nice, not your normal rubbish) you can't take your own food or drink into the park, and bag checks are carried out before entry.Overall this was an amazing day out and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. We would recommend it to anyone for an enjoyable family day.

review_447205179,“Fun filled time”,"Since we last came two years ago, there are new attractions and the place is well maintained.The only complain is the pray area or surau is way too small to cater for the holiday crowd. Only allowing 5 people the most to pray means waiting time for the others.The management should consider a bigger surau as Moslems from Malaysia make up quite a big percentage of the visitors to USS. A must visit when in Singapore.

review_447203653,“Giod fun”,"It is like any theme park and the queues for rides take up much more time than the ride itself. There is an option to take a premium ticket and beat the queue. Do enquire about it because I realised after entering the park that it would have been a better option.The park takes about 4-5 hours to complete. Refillable water bottles are a good idea. Otherwise food courts are good. It is a good idea to carry swimming costumes with you all over Singapore. Specially for kids.

review_447112615,“AmAzing family day out! ”,"I would honestly suggest you divide universal studios tour into two days to get to play all rides and watch all shows. Alternatively, If you have two age groups you can split into two groups; younger (age 2-5) starts from madgascare and ongoing, the other group starts from Hollywood and on going. I highly recommend buying the express tickets, it's time investment! A queue of 90 minutes will be a 15 minute long! Shows are really nice and you get take photos with characters. December was an amazing time to visit, it was amazingly decorated for Christmas, and Christmas Carlos were playing all the time!

Although it was a short trip, it was worth it.We had been wanting to go to Universal studios and it was on top of our list. Universal studios is huge with my favorite characters all over the place.The best rides are Transformers, Revenge of the Mummy and Jurassic Parks Rapid adventure. There are many more which are good but these are thrilling. Every moment spent there was worth it.The only con of Universal Studio (which is why I gave a 4 star) is the time. It closes too early and they start asking people to leave. As soon as the clock strikes 6:00 PM, all the rides are shut down.

I expected there to be a few non-Q activities but there are none, so it's either just eat or Q for a ride which got boring after a while. Not recommended if you have kids below 8 as they couldn't stand the 30-60 min waits for the rides. Of course, its worse when we decided to come during a Singapore public holiday - my mistake - which is why I give the benefit of the doubt and give it a 3 star instead of 2. Not really worth the money.

review_446797918,“Go there early”,"If you are planning to visit on a weekend, go there early. I went there yesterday (26/12/16) at about 9.40am and the queues are already so long to get in. Queued for about 1.5h for the transformers ride, 20mins for the Mummy ride, 1h++ for the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, 1h for the Puss In Boots and 1.5h for the Enchanted Airways. The Transformers ride was awesome! Definitely worth the queuing time. It was a good experience on the Mummy ride although we visited USS many times but didn't get to try the ride, but it's scary:( Jurassic Park ride was very good. For the Puss in Boots ride, the staffs are like giving so many people in the express lane to go for every 4 turns while the normal lane was like 1 time and then the express one,no wonder the staffs said queuing time is about 85mins for the normal lane. Enchanted Airways too, staffs said queuing time about 35mins but ended up queuing for 1h20mins because the staffs kept giving the express lane! Please, be fair to the people queuing in the normal lane too, like every 2 turns give to the normal lane while every 2 turns give to the express lane, not every 4 turns give to the express lane while every 1 turn give to the normal lane. Waterworks show was fantastic. And what? Queued 30mins for the 4D show? Definitely do not worth it. I don't know if the park is open everyday until 10.30pm or some days, yesterday the fireworks display was at 10.30pm. I went to a light room(I don't know what's the name, but it's inside the park) It was so beautiful! Took so many photos there. Feeling high in Christmas mood. The light room I think it is supposed to be only for Christmas. Overall a very good day.

Upon exiting, I pushed my grandma out on her wheelchair and then realized that I have left my camera bag inside. I ran back as the door closed behind me and the next show starts; however, I didn't see my camera bag where I left it. I kept searching throughout the show with no luck. As that show ended, I approached the personnel who were very willing to help but couldn't really do anything about it. I have also reported it to the guest service. It's just hard to believe that a theme park at the caliber of US would be so unsafe. I wrote this within 3 hours of losing my camera bag.

There are several small restaurants if you want to have lunch. I would not go here unless you have children.

review_446095208,“full day activity”,"With so many exhibits be ready to walk a lot. Its superb. the vibe and feel at this place is so amazing. thoroughly enjoyed the 4d shows and entire lay out of the theme park. the waterworld show in Jurrasic park theme is ok - found it very loud and aggressive. 4d shrek show is awesome. The minion store is a must visit for all minion lovers. The Madagascar ride is also good. Starbucks and Ben n jerry is a must. Kids will love this place. Carry a hat as its very sunny and hot during the day. Shorts and sleeveless is more suitable coz the heat is un bearable.

review_446045497,“Battlestar Galactica is a MUST go!”,"First of all, the place was quite small compared to Universal Studios in another country. There was not much ride for adults, the only fun rides for me are the Battlestar Galactica, Cyclone, Transformers, and Mummy. There are long queues in every ride, we had to wait for a good few hours to ride the Battlestar Galactica! Advice: go for that ride first when you reach there or wait till night time when most of the ""tour"" crowds are gone. I did not get to visit some of the areas (Madagascar, Far Far Away & New York) due to time wasted when queuing for the rides in Sci-Fi City, Ancient Egypt and Lost World. I also didnt get to watch any of the shows because I was queuing for the ridesStay till the night to watch the fireworks! Its worth it! Recommed to go earlier before the fireworks starts to get a good view.

review_446038701,"“Good attractions and ambience, but beware of long waiting time”","The attractions and rides are fine, and the ambience of the park good (except for loud music in places). However, it was impossible to enjoy the park without purchasing the additional express ticket (at 60 SGD) per ticket, as all the more popular rides had waiting times of around 50 minutes. We would have spent most of the day queuing for hours for two minute rides. This made for a very expensive day at the park. More rides or limit the number of guests.

review_446033705,“Single rider privilege”,"We frequently visit Universal studio in Singapore because it is my son favorite theme park. The theme park is very attractive and numerous people line up for different games. I do not like to waste my time to line up so I get up early in the morning.   My son prefers to use money for souvenirs rather than buying the fast pass. Therefore, he saves money but sometimes he will miss some fun~fair. This do not matter because we will come back in future. In the past, we used most of the time to play transformer again and again . This time we use the privilege of singe rider to play transformer 3 times within 1 hour. Therefore we have plenty of time for shopping. I highly recommend that family members should take the ride using single rider privilege. It is better than the fast pass.

review_446009797,“Pleasantly surprised--AND USE THE SINGLE RIDER OPTION”,"Based on my prior research, I was prepared to be underwhelmed. This place is small for a high end amusement park; it has fewer attractions than other universal parks; and it can be quite crowded. With that said, I had a GREAT day here. It was just right for a one-day excursion into the fantasy of the movies. I even think the park has more ambiance than the Universal in Orlando. We went on a weekday and got there before the gates opened. This allowed us to do some big ticket attractions before they got too busy. My advice is to do the two Battlestar Galactica roller coasters first (the Cylon is a bit more intense) as they get long lines that last all day, and there is no single rider option. After those, try the Transformers ride. This was my favorite attraction. Here is an IMPORTANT tip for the rest of the day-- USE THE SINGLE RIDER LINE at the attractions if you are there on a busy day. Don't waste your money on the overpriced special pass that gets you ahead in line. By using the single rider line, we never waited more than 10 minutes to get on a ride, and most of our waits were less. You'll have the same thrill, even if you are sitting next to a stranger, and you might even make a friend! We went to the Transformers ride when it had an 80-minute wait for the normal line, and the single rider option got us on in less than 10. Several attractions like the Jurassic Park raft ride don't advertise a single rider option. Just ask the attendant at the ride entrance, and they will tell you if single riders are allowed as well as the estimated wait. Regarding food, there is a food court not far outside the entrance to the park. Fast food prices are a bit lower out there.

We bought admission tickets through Klook as cheaper & prebought fast pass through USS website. Klook voucher scanned at turnstile then fast pass redeemed for green wristband at guest services. Fast pass was fantastic as no waiting at all for any of the rides.

The main rides we very busy so as time was precious we decided to just walk around. We visited the amazing lights display which was breathtaking.

review_445811919,“Great family fun”,"We went as a family on Sunday and also during school holidays. We purchase the Universal Express as we expected a large crowd.We booked online and had our tickets printed before hand. Arrived at Harbourfront MRT and walked to USS via the boardwalk. It was good that the walkway was covered as it rained that day.Few notes on Universal Express:1. Not all rides have express lane - one in particular is the Canopy Flyer.2. We bought the Universal Express online and pre-printed ours - we realise that the pass is not tagged to the individual. As such, we can share the pass. 3. If you are not constraint for time, most of the rides including transformers, human, cyclon has waiting time of 10mins to 20 mins after 8pm.Overall, it was great fun and a fairy tale experience for the young ones.

review_445739616,"“Great Day on Great Rides! Great Time, even though it cost a bit more!”","I have been to Universal Studios Singapore (USS) twice before. 1st time for a corporate event, 2nd time, just a normal visitor. The 2nd visit, I was disheartened by the long queues at each ride and really didn't enjoy myself as the long queues meant I only managed to catch very few rides. After a few years, yesterday, a friend and I decided to make it a day at USS. This time, we spurged on the Universal Express Unlimited Pass. This is in addition to the Single Admission Ticket and what the Universal Express does is that it allows the holder to enter each ride through an Express queue line which is usually empty. And the Unlimited part of it allows you to take the ride as often as you like. Believe me when I say, this Universal Express is a great expenditure if you really want to enjoy the theme park.On the theme park itself, there are 7 zones. These are New York, Sci-Fi City, Ancient Egypt, The Lost World, Far Far Away, Madagascar and Hollywood. The Battlestar Galactica rides were awesome, so were the 3D rides all over the other zones, though I felt some of the 3D images were 'getting fuzzy'.Being an enclosed theme park, the food and drinks sold inside are rather pricey, when you can compared with alternatives available in Singapore. As the theme park does not allow you to bring food from elsewhere, do bring your own drinking water and you can top up drinking water at drinking fountains inside the park.USS is situation in the equatorial region. Hence it is hot and humid inside the park. Wear comfortable dry fit tee, shorts and running shoes. It is the only way to beat the heat in there.And to maximise your time in the park, plan your time to catch the shows in between the rides. With the Universal Express pass, my friend and I were able to do 90% of the rides (we skipped the very kiddy rides) and some of the shows.Don't miss the Waterworld show, though aged, still thrills with their stunts and pyrotechnics! The other stage shows were just a fun to watch.As it turn dark, the lightup of USS is pretty nice and I found out that on Saturday nights, were will be a short firework show which I missed.Overall, USS is a pricey experience but a nicely appropirated theme park in Singapore.For those you are living in Singapore, I learned that there are half yearly membership, which cost only a small fraction above the price of a single admission ticket.For family with kids, the membership make sense as you can bring the family back to USS as often as you want and cover one or two zones extensively during each visit.Last Note. There are free lockers for Battlestar Galatica rides. Please put everything in the lockers before you take the ride as they will turn you back if you have your wallet or handphone with you. For the Wet Rides, there are lockers that cost S$4 per hour to rent and ponchos for S$4 each. Go bring your own zip lock bags and ponchos before these rides. And even if you get wet, the hot weather will dry you up pretty quickly if you are wearing a dry fit tee.

review_445736959,“VIP TOUR”,"Take the VIP tours if you are looking to experience USS in the best possible way.

Skip queues, special family waiting room, meals coupons, free usage of stroller, merchandise discounts, special photos session with any characters are some of the exclusive VIP benefits. This will be a tour that ensure you will not miss a single thing in the park and leave with no regrets.

Such an amazing day to be had by all, just remember that during holidays this place is so busy the waits in cues are long so I would recommend purchasing the VIP express tickets which get you in everywhere so much quicker which makes the experience such a wonderful one, and if your a solo traveller or a couple. Using the Solo traveller line is the best way to also get onto the rides without having to wait as long, we found we got onto the transformers ride without any wait while groups were waiting 30 minutes or more.

Carry water and refill, as buying water in the park is quite expensive.5) Dress for comfort, and not style. Have a great visit to the park.

review_445577379,“Best experience in Singapore - do not miss!”,"Was in Singapore for a week, and saw pretty much every major attraction. US Singapore is the #1 experience in Singapore hands down. Loads of activities for all ages, for adults, I would suggest going for the Mummy, galactica and Transformers rides. Also, the $67 tickets are quite reasonable. The express pass is too expensive however ($50), it would be more affordable if it cost $25-30.Tips: Avoid weekends/holidays (It took me 1.5 hours in queue to ride Battlestar Galactica!) and reach the place early - it gets really crowded in the afternoon and you will face long lines. Complete the best attractions (rides) as early as possible and spend the rest of the time on the shows etc which have shorter lines.

review_445504453,“From a Universe Long Long Ago”,"If you have time to spare whilst visiting Singapore, and a must if you are with kids, overall it provides what you would expect from a classic theme park.However, a lot of the rides/themes seem dated, based upon older film versions (e.g. Jurassic Park and Transformers) rather then up to date versions and I did not get how the Egyptian themed area linked to Universal brand?Kid based attractions based on classics like Sesame Street, Shrek and the new Minion's franchises are sure to be popular with any kids. Also from a kids perspective it is not too sprawling and is therefore easy to cover in a day.The usual 'time to ride' indicators were useful as ever to guide you on how long you would be queuing.

We waited almost an hour for the transformers ride and after that decided to purchase the express pass ($40). No regrets! Loved ALL the adult rides. Plenty for families with young children too! Most of the rides have free lockers available for a limited time. We enjoyed some of the shows too, esp Waterworld! Couple of tips:1. Wear comfy shoes - sport shoes would be best. 2. Don't carry too much with you 3. Keep an empty water bottle to fill up at the water stations - plenty around! 4. If crowded, invest in the express pass!

With the studios covering different decades, it offers nostalgia and entertainment to both parents and kids alike.

Shrek and Madagascar certainly offered the 'kiddie theme' but their rides were equally awesome (long live the purple dragon ride! :P ).I appreciated the different attractions and daily, festive atmosphere of the entire theme park, from the moment you walk in - you can stay along the benches for the entire time and yet you would never get bored with the different ""stars"" flocking your way.They are also very organized and customer-friendly. My daughter once lost her cap after riding Shrek's dragon-coaster and we were still able to contact USS admin. via e-mail inquiries and retrieved the cap (thanks in part to my friend who got it from the park and mailed it back) - these little things are what make us come back for more.

Don't waste time with the Human version. Because there is usually a long waiting time for these rides, be prepared to queue at least an hour or so. If you have some extra cash to spare, just go for the express pass.A good tip is to buy the tickets online to avoid the queue. Also, if you happen to be in Singapore during October, they have the Halloween Horror Nights which is my favourite event there.

review_444950951,“An enjoyable day at USS”,"It was a Friday and queues of about 30 people each were already formed up at the four turnstiles. When the park was promptly opened at 10 am, people were seen running in, presumably targeting the Human and Cyclon roller coasters and Transformer rides. My family however chose to head in the other direction, towards Madagascar and Far Far Away zones. There were hardly anyone in these 2 zones, and we could take the rides without any wait time. We came back in the evening at about 7 pm and we were able to take Human (15 minute wait) and Transformer (5 minute wait) rides fairly quickly.Here're the rides we took and our rating:Madagascar Zone: Madagascar: A Crate Adventure (1 out of 5) - Young ones would enjoy this, but pace too slow for adults.Far Far Away Zone:Enchanted Airways (4 out of 5) - A thrilling but short roller coaster. Kids will love this.Shrek 4-D Adventure (4 out of 5) - This is our 3rd experience and it is still a good show!Puss In Boots’ Giant Journey (4 out of 5) - Interesting ride that starts with soaring up a tower.Ancient Egypt:Revenge of the Mummy (4 out of 5) - Thrilling and scary ride that is not for the faint-hearted Good spooks!The Lost World (Opens at 11 am):Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (3.5 out of 5) - You have a 50% chance of getting your feet soaked. The ending is a sudden plunge!Waterworld (4 out of 5) - Great stunt performance with lots of laughs at the beginning. Go 15 minutes earlier before showtime to get a good spot.New York:Lights, Camera, Action!™ Hosted by Steven Spielberg (4 out of 5) - Great storm effectsSesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase (2 out of 5) - More for young kids.Sci-Fi City:Human (5 out of 5) - One of the best roller coasters I ever rode in, Fast with hardly any chance to catch a breath.Transformers (5 out of 5) - The effects are so real that you feel as if you are really in the thick of the action.Santa's All Stars Christmas (1 December 2016 to 2 January 2017)Live show “Bah Humbug! A Christmas Spectacular” (5 out of 5) - An entertaining musical show hosted by Little Match Girl and Scrooge featuring Sesame Street characters, Minions, and others. The singing and dancing were of good quality.Illuminate the Season with Christmas Cheer! (3 out of 5) - Great for taking pictures.Santa's Village (3 out of 5) - Visit if you have young ones below 10.

review_444824355,“Smallest Universal but still a good place to have fun.”,"The Universal Studios in Singapore is the smallest theme park i've ever visited. I rated this theme park terrible because, Elmo is for Toddlers and i find it very absurd that a two year old cannot ride elmo due to its height restriction! We visited Disneyland and ride on the Peter Pan and they didn't apply height restriction as ride wise it is exactly the same as Elmo's Spaghetti SpaceChase. I guess for a group that think of themselves as smart is not at all smart as they haven't thought of this matter!

Park has 5 different sections. Our 2 y/o loved the Sesame Street and shrek parts of the park and loved the rides and meeting the characters.Limited stuff to do for adults however (3/4 good rides.. especially transformers 4d which was amazing.Overall we really enjoyed it and our 2 y/o absolutely loved it.

review_444600265,“Go late afternoon to avoid crowds and heat! ”,"If I can give any advise for Universal Studios - Singapore it would be to wait until late afternoon to go! We went on a Monday to avoid the busy crowds that come with weekends, however we got there 10:30am and it was still packed!! We decided as entry was $74 that we weren't going to buy the express but after we waited ONE AND A HALF HOURS to get onto a water ride we decided to get it. The express pass is pricy! $50 will get you express access to every ride once, and $70 gives you unlimited express to every ride. We decided to go the $70 and really regretted it at the end of the day. Reason is because come 3-4 o'clock the place was dead! And we didn't need to even use the express pass as we could just walk onto the rides. So my advice would be to come late afternoon, wonder around, take your day pictures, go to the shows and then later at night go on the rides! It's much cooler (weather wise) as well as riding the rides at night adds a different element. We had an absolute ball and highly recommending coming to Universal.

review_444557685,“Fun for kids”,"We went with our 3 & 5yrs old on a Monday from 12.30pm to 8.30pm. Operating hours had been extended to 9pm in December for the Christmas activities. It was quite crowded with queues up to an hour, probably due to local school holidays & USS Christmas activities.We went on the following rides suitable for our kids:-Treasure Hunters jeep ride (50mins Q)-Dino-soarin(40mins Q)-Shrek 4D (15mins Q)-Magic Potion Spin (No Q)-Madagascar Boat ride (15mins Q)-King Julian Beach Party Go -Round carousel (5mins Q)-Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase (20mins Q)The queue areas are mostly sheltered and there are water coolers inside for those who are thirsty or need to top up their water bottles. We went to the Santa Village & Light up for photo taking too. It's nicely done up but doesn't justify the ""after 5pm admission bundle ticket"" price for it, unless you are planning to go to SEA Aquarium or Cove Waterpark before that. Best to buy a full day ticket because most rides close by 830pm. Food & drinks aren't very expensive. Tastes ok too. A big slice of pizza costs $11, kid's meal $10, small sundae $4.50, pasta with chicken $14. Collectable water bottle with soft drink range from $10~$28, refills at $2. With 2 meal/rest breaks in between, we had no time for other rides. Didn't catch any performances as well. Neither did we go for any Meet & Greet sessions because we were at the rides. There's a lot of walking, mostly without shelter. Strollers available for rent at $15 single seat, $20 double seat. Stroller parking available outside every ride. Not many sheltered rest areas. Most are part of the eateries. On the whole we had fun and wished we had time & energy for more. If you think you have time to come back again in the next 6~12mths, do upgrade to a season pass (valid 6mths) or annual pass from $24~. The queue to upgrade the pass is quite long. We waited for 40mins even though there were less than 10pax in the queue at 8pm. Do allocate enough time for it.

Also it is beautiful around Christmas so do try planning your visit around then. Enough attractions for the little one's as well as adults. We managed to cover all the attractions of our interest within half a day and did the beaches at Sentosa on another day as we had the time but one can do both in one day. Do NOT miss out on the transformers ride! We went in twice. Do try the slush sold at different counters around the park, helps beat the heat.

review_444393968,“Fun Filled Day!!”,"Universal Studios, Singapore is a theme adventure park located on Sentosa island.To begin with, Sentosa Island is theme park having multiple attractions like Universal Studios/ Seaquarium/ Kidzania etc. However, Universal Studios itself requires one complete day and further you will not be able to do all rides/ attractions in a single day.I went to the USS (Universal Studios Singapore) with my husband. The ticket/ day pass costs around 75-84 SDG/person (rates vary on different promotional schemes) and premium pass costs around 25 SDG more. Once you have an entry to USS, any ride can be availed any no. of times without any additional cost. There are separate entry gates for basic pass holders and premium pass holders, so that less waiting time for premium pass holders; however it is wastage, because normally waiting time for rides is approx 5-20 min only.Tips:1. Reach in time i.e. by 10 AM. It opens at 10.00 and closes by 07:00 PM.2. If ticket has been booked in advance through some travel agency/ hotel, then pls ensure that you carry the right ticket. Actually, in singapore, small size tickets are given, all having a unique barcode and picture advertisement of some attraction, which leads to confusion that which ticket is applicable for which attraction.3. Carry a water bottle. Water points are available at all attractions. Else, buying water everytime not only cost money but time as well.4. The USS has circular in shape. Major parts are : a) Far Far Away Land : Has attractions/ rides /shops/Meet & greet with characters mainly for children such as Shrek/ Fiona , Sesame Street, Minion, Puss in Boots etcb) Mummy Area: Attractions and rides such as Revenge of Mummy, some merry go-round etcc) Lost world: Jurassic park rides/ dinosaur ridesd) Hollywood: Movies, light camera action, shows etce) New York:f) Sci fi city: Terminators/ robots/ rides etc.5. Following rides are must for any adventure loving person. Pls ensure that you do not miss following rides/ attractions:a. Terminator- 4D rideb. Revenge of mummy: wonderful/thrilling ridec. Puss in the boots: Anti-gravity rided. Dinosaur: Lost world ridee. Hollywood: Lights Camera & Actionf. Far Far Away Land:4-D movieIf you want adrenaline rush, then rides such as cyclone/galactica are also advised. We did not do these, rather did some wonderful rides twice.6. When you enter, put hand on a map, so that you can decide which rides to do and how to plan them. Because there are some attractions which are like show/movie and have fixed time slot. Ensure that you are available at that time. Also, if you want to have your photos clicked with characters then they also have fixed Meet n Greet slots.7. When you enter USS, it feels like wow. And we start clicking photos. I would suggest, then when enter have your photos clicked with each attraction so that you look fresh in the photos. else by the end of the day, weariness appears on the face. But still do not waste your time in photos, rather enjoy rides. Also, it is noticed that mostly people do not take rides in second half as they get busy in lunch/ take rest. In second half the waiting time reduces tremendously. Use this golden time to do your favourite rides again.8. Wear very comfortable shoes/sneakers/sandals as you have to walk a lot.9. Lastly, choose a working day/ non-holiday to visit to avoid rush.Hope, I have covered all points, but still you can leave a Message for any confusion. Have a great time.

You can choose 3 ways to come here from vivo city mall, by skytrain, cable car, or walk. I chose walk, cheaper and you can enjoy the sea. Visit the most interesting attraction first. I chose transformer. If you come during the weekend, they have fireworks party in the night.

review_444353755,“Great day out 😊”,"Me and my partner spent the day here, we went on a Monday and went in as soon as the gates opened. Up until 12pm the queues were no longer than 15 minutes. After this they went up to 60-80 minutes, so I recommend going a little earlier for a couple hours of short ride queues. We did several character meet and greets, all the attractions, and some shows. Definitely worth watching the water world show its very good! But be warned they don't joke when it says ""soak zone"" I literally walked out dripping wet but it was good fun. Food is a little expensive, we bought a snack through the day but took our own lunch and water bottles and filled them up via the water fountains onsite. Rides are good fun, on a small scale for Universal but still a good full day of attractions we spent 6 hours here!

review_444243989,“Good place to visit”,"I visited today (Wednesday) with my friend, and I was so afraid that we will need the express unlimited pass, but actually, we didn't need it, we'll only once we had to wait 40 mins in the queue and while waiting I was thinking ""why I didn't get the pass"" but only in that particular time we had to wait that long, in the busiest one we spend in average 20 mins, in the non busy one, sometimes less than 5, so if you go during the week, don't bother about the pass. Without the pass we managed to do all the ""grown up"" attractions plus the waterfront show, plus the theatre show, plus transformers (2 extra times), human (2 extra times), the mummies (1 extra time) and cyclon (4 extra times) and we only arrived there at midday. Another tip, food is expensive inside, and in our case (and according to some friends too) they don't check your bags. We brought biscuits and crisps, if I knew they wouldn't check I would have taken my Tupperware full of food. However, don't stress! A good tip is to leave the park and visit the Malaysian street market (which is opposite the entrance) food in there is cheaper and nicer. You can leave the park and get and stamp to get back in. The park closed at 21.00, and I promise you, we visited more attractions from 19.00 to the end than from the moment we arrived. The reason is that families take theirs kids home early, so less people towards the end of the day. We finished with the human ride, and we had the entire car for ourselves (we got into the ride at about 20.57)Ah, another tip, pay with MasterCard and you get 10% discount plus a free bottle gift. You can buy online and get your tickets at the counter in there if you don't have a printer. Cheerios!

review_444148020,“Fun for kids and adult..”,"It was our first visit and well planned, as we bought the tickets online from Jakarta. Good idea to have the tickets in advance to avoid long queue. The breakfast with Sesame Street was a blast for our 4 year old daughter. It was amazing experience to see Elmo and Friends were become ""real"" and accompany her bfast at Louis Pizza. The day was fun but since it was Saturday long queue everywhere, but you can pay extra SGD 50 to purchase express lane if you want to skip the long queue and have more time to enjoy all the rides. Photo booth traps in many spots, they took the photo of you and if you're interested to take the photos they will charge you from SGD 25 to 30 for each photo. So expensive, I feel robbed! But it was optional though you can also say thanks and walk away not to take your photos that were taken. Overall it was a fun day but extremely tired to walk around the whole area. Just prepare your legs and your pocket for more exciting experiences and buy more gifts.

This is very surprise to us, because to get express tickets are not cheap. and for the First family, we got free photo with puss in boots from dark room photographand it looks like the day it became one of the most enjoyable day for our family.USS One of the best entertainment we have ever visited. the place is spacious and clean. uss also provide stroller for rent so that we no longer need to carry the stroller from the hotel.There are seven areas in uss: Hollywood, New York, Sci Fi City, Ancient Egypt, Jurrasic park, Far Far away and madagascar.In Hollywood we could see the atmosphere of old hollywood, form the house and shop, even we can meet with Marilyn Monroe if lucky.In NY we could see the town where there is figure sesame street and children very glad to meet elmo an friends and sesame street at Spaghetti space.Then we get to the Sci Fi City, there is a roller coaster that seemed incredible exciting, because I did not dare to ride both of them so we only play under the galactica while father riding Battlestar Galactica. there is also adventure transformers 3d, to me Transformer is one of the best rides in the uss. 3d remarkable performances so makes the children were stunned and felt that we were actually going to be in combat robot.We passed Ancient egypt because children are less familiar with The Mumy.Afterwards there Jurrasic park, in Jurassic dino children can only ride Dino Soarin, Pteranodon that can fly. it was quite entertaining themThen there Far Far away, adventure Puss in Boots is quite interesting to make a roller coaster so enjoyable. as well as shrek 4d event, children enjoyed the event because it can feel the water splashing, attack from spider, etc.magadaskar is the last, there are King Julien's beach party go round, children like this. and lastly there crate adventure, we will board the boat and into the adventure in madagascar.there are some rides that can not be ridden by children under 5 years old because they were not high enough, but it does not make children sad, because there are many interesting gameseach area provided so much food and drink that can be bought so children do not feel hunger and thirst.so yes i can say, uss is one of the best theme park in Asia

There are quite a lot of rides for the younger children but we felt it just fell a little short for the teenage market. At this time of year if you are going mid week don't bother with a fast pass as it is quite easy to get on the rides.

We didn't get there till midday but still managed to go on all the rides we hoped to and see the attractions. Lots of food and drink options at reasonable prices. Best ride for me was the Mummy, rode it 3 times! Transformers ride is definitely worth the queue also!

review_442737657,“Fun for all the Family!”,"We really enjoyed this theme park and spent over 5 hours there. We visited on a Wednesday and it did not seem very crowded. Our average ride wait time was 10-15 minutes ( but we didn't go on the roller coaster rides).The Waterworld Show was very entertaining and worth seeing.My favourite ride was the water ride in the Jurassic Park area. We got very wet but it was worth it. If you are wearing runners, you should take a spare set of dry socks to wear afterwards. Our clothes dried quickly but our runners and socks felt damp for hours afterwards.The Steven Spielberg sound Show is worth seeing as well.Overall, a great visit.

review_442541065,“Great rides! ”,"This theme park is not exactly huge, but have plenty of rides to enjoy. Especially if you are a roller-coaster and water splashing ride enthusiast. My favorite is the Transformer ride located in the sci-fi zone. It is not a roller coaster, but it feels like one. It uses 3D movie, wind, water spray, and your air to give amazing immersion. Besides who doesn't like robots that talks and blow things up!! Best best!! I also extremely enjoyed the Shrek (did I spell that green ogre's name correctly?) 4D show.. Watch your neck but things really came towards you :-) The excellent live stunt of water world also not to be missed. And of course the Jurassic Park adventure.. For which you might want to wear a poncho if you really don't like being wet.. But they provide a body dryer after the ride where the whole family can cuddle and get blasted a hot air... Or like me, take the short ride of canopy flyer and you will be dry by the time you are back on solid ground again. A full one day is needed for i-dont-have-time traveller, and two days visit for i-want-to-properly-enjoy-this travellers. I did the first one and now I'm sitting at Changi trying to loose the sore feet and thigh.

review_442489390,“Fun day out”,"Got to go on all the rides with the express pass so highly recommend it if it's too busy which you can find out after you enter the park and purchase within the park. There are 2 options, the standard express which allows you to use the express queue once for each ride which was the one I got for $50SGD and the upgraded express one which allows you to use the queue unlimited times which is like about $70SGD. I booked the tickets beforehand but there is no need as you can purchase at the gate.Highlight for me was the transformers ride it was an epic 4D visual experience combined with the rollercoaster type feel to it as well. The twin coasters was also a thrilling highlight as well as the egyptian rollercoaster which is in pitch black.

review_441634713,“Santa's All-Star Christmas - extended opening hours”,"USS is celebrating their Christmas event and it would be a good time to visit due to their extended opening hours (10am - 9pm on weeknights, till 10pm on weekends). The park is also beautifully lit and decorated with some special experiences.Don't miss:- “Bah Humbug! A Christmas Spectacular” @ The PantagesLive show with dance and music and even a very cool acrobat performance. Watch out for the inflatable balls they release at the end of the show! - Santa's Village Easy to mistaken as just another park decoration as it looks like a big lit up Christmas tree. The tunnel leads to Santa's Village, it's a bit wild in there. Kids will love it, and if you love taking photos, don't miss it.- Minions capsules 12 for $10Probably the best buy at the park if you are looking for a cheap-ish souvenir to bring back. The capsules contain a variety of bric-bracs like keychains and snap bracelets.In terms of festive food, noticeably lesser than last year (they weren't very good anyways). We purchased a collectible Santa cup that was filled with enough froyo for a small family from Star Dots. Cup is of nice quality. The one at Mel's Diner comes with banana flavoured soft serve and I think a different one is sold at the cart outside Casa Del Wild.With the extended opening hours, you should be able to manage without an Express Pass. Birthday Month OfferingsAs it was my son's birthday month, we went ahead to claim his birthday entitlements. He received a Minion capsule, a popcorn voucher (small cup) and a 15% discount voucher at KT's Grill or merchandise.

We bought the single use express pass but also arrived early to beat the queues (i.e. Lined up regularly in the morning when there was no wait for the roller coasters and then used the express pass later when the lines were longer - were talking over an hour wait for the roller coasters).For both adults we paid $250 for express pass on top. Pay a bit more you can have unlimited express pass. After riding each ride once or twice the novelty wears off so I'd recommend just the single use express pass.Highly recommend seeing the waterworks show.Food/drink are very overinflated inside for poor quality food. We got a pass out for lunch and ate at the very cheap and delicious Malaysian street food hall (completely stuffed full for $6 each).

review_441272595,“Fun for a day”,"Visited the Universal Studios park yesterday and had a great time. A good time to visit this attraction is definitely on a weekday as it's a lot less crowded than on weekends. When visiting the park do note that certain rides will have longer waiting times than others. For example, the Battlestar ride's waiting time was between 40-70 minutes whereas the Mummy ride's waiting time was 5 minutes. This is mainly because the Battlestar ride is a two seater whereas the Mummy is a four seater so make sure to plan which rides you want to go to first. With the introduction of the new Puss-In-Boots ride we were pleasantly surprised to find a good new ride that's suitable for families and yet still provides the thrill of a rollercoaster. The food and drinks at the park are overpriced but this is to be expected so do bring your own water bottle which you can fill up using the water coolers available all over the park. When going to the park make sure to wear comfortable and light clothes (I'd advise against dresses and skirts) and when choosing shoes to wear do note that if you wear slippers you may be required to put them in cubbyholes for certain rides (Also do note that if you want to go on the Jurrasic park rapids adventure ride you are probably going to get wet so do buy/bring a raincoat or have a change of clothes with you as there are drying stations outside the ride but you might have to pay. If you're wearing sneakers/covered shoes these might get wet during the ride so be careful!)

review_441268724,“Small theme park that has seen better days.”,"Universal Studios Singapore (USS) was launched in March 2010, and it is 6+ years old. You can see the aging theme park, and the upkeep of some of the attractions were not done well. For example, the Treasure Hunters motor car ride was dismal. The fake crocodiles in the ponds were so covered with algae and also discolored, it showed how much upkeep was put into it. The mummy ride also had technical errors.I went during a school holiday but the park was not crowded at all, a far cry from a few years back. The good thing was that you get to the rides faster, but I think it reflects the state of USS now. Quite a number of the USS crew looked bored and disinterested in what they were doing. USS has seen better days.This is a small theme park, and one day is ample time to spend at the park. You can exit and re-enter the park if you wish to go outside the park to get something else to eat.

review_440775025,“How to get the cheapest ticket and when to go”,"The cheapest way to buy the ticket is Klook. You will find most sites selling expensive trips with 1 way transport etc. However the cheapest way is to buy online and go by taxi. The trip advisor is full of advise for avoiding the weekend. It is the best advise. We went on Monday after waiting many days in Singapore although the gut is to do this first but we followed advise of others. There is little crowd and very little at 10AM when it opens.There are just 1 big show (Waterworld) and a few big rides. Here is my suggestion to do everything in quick time with minimal walking - 1. Reach at 930AM and be in line. Start with Transformers ride (go right), 2. Then go to Mummy ride (at Egypt), 3. Then the Galactica (at Sci fi zone) if you can do the big rides.4. Wait outside Jussasic park (after Sci fi zone) as it opens at 11 and do the water ride on the right (at 4PM there was 1.5hr wait and at my schedule you will be in the first few tugs). 5. Do Waterword at 11456. Do Airways in Far Far world and Pussy in BootsWith this you are basically done. Rest all are small shows for kids - Donkey, When I grow Up PLUS Steven Spielburg.Follow the above tip and you are done for the day with many hours to spare for repeats.

Some of the most amazing rides in the Universal Studios are the Jurassic Park adventure ride, the roller coaster, the Transformers, the Shreik, etc. There are also many restaurants in the Universal Studios to enjoy the variety of Foods that Singapore has to offer. The park is very crowded and there are long queues in each ride and so if possible one can buy the express pass which will let you bypass the queue and enjoy the rides without waiting.

review_440530008,“Q jumpers”,"Visited today(Monday), average of 70 mins wait for the main rides. There were so many people with express tickets (they go straight to front) and so many ""single riders"" who also queue jump that it wasn't funny! Would have hated to have young kids with me. There were so many additional charges for Madame Tussaud's etc that was off putting as it was costly enough for a universal studio/aquarium/cable car ticket. The rides and the place were good but when we got off the cable car we found ourselves confused as to where we were going. Lack of signposts as you get off the cable car.Would not rush back. Costly and frustrating day.

review_440501542,“Good enough for Asia”,"This Universal Studio is remarkably small in comparison to all other Universal Studios even though it has the best roller-coaster ride. Not many options for children under 90cm though and no nightly fireworks as well. Evening parade before closing was cancelled because of Christmas rehearsals. No clear signs on the map or upon entry regarding all the shows/cancellation for the day.

review_440488583,“MUST SPEND A DAY AT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS”,"Having visited UNIVERSAL STUDIOS on Sentosa Island previously it was the number 1 priority to go there yet again, Wow what a dayGet there early (opens at 10) as there are just so many attractions to see & rides to go on.Whether you are an oldie or a youngster there is indeed so much for everyone. And there are so many places at reasonable prices to eat at.Must go on the Wild River Boat Ride, it's so much fun & you will get wet.Transformers to truly fantastic!!. Loved it first time there so knew this time to expect to be screaming now & then. Seems so real. Great settings so much to do & enjoy...get there early as it doesn't take long to have to expect maybe 20 minutes in a queue waiting to enjoy a ride.It's possible to buy a ""beat the queue"" at the entry when purchasing admission tickets, bit expensive BUT to walk pass all the people lined up & waiting can make the cost well worthwhile.A visit to Universal Studios when visiting Singapore is a MUST

review_440480055,“Small and limited attractions but Fun!”,"Having been to Universal Studios in California and Florida, the Singapore one is smaller and with limited attractions. Will it stop me from coming here again? NO! Even if limited, the park offers a glimpse and fun of a Universal Studios. They have The Mummy and Jurassic park ride which is a must. Plus a Transformers ride/attraction. How to get there: From Vivo city, take the tram to the first station. TIp: you may use your EZ Card but not the Tourist pass one. Over-all, I will still visit. In fact I hit myself a season pass. I just wish they would have Harry Potter village/attractions.

review_440389210,“Great fun but get there early at the weekend!”,"I visited on a Sunday and arrived at the opening time at 1000 and by 1130, the queuing time for the Battlestar Galactica Cylon was nearly an hour. If you are visiting during the weekend, then I would advise to get there early and do both Battlestar Galactica rides first before anything else, as you will save a lot of time queueing. Revenge of the Mummy: the Ride and the Transformer ride are also very much worth doing and the queues seemed to be a lot shorter for those two rides. You can buy your USS ticket along with the monorail ticket at the Waterfront station, if you choose to get there by using the Sentosa Express. USS is well worth a visit!

review_440286289,“Fun and Exciting”,"This is my first time in singapore and I went to USS with two of my friends. We came in the morning and play from 10 am to 6 pm.There are many exciting attractions and stage show. I recommend the universal express ticket so you can skip the regular queue or just go for the single rider queue line. You might be separated from your party during the ride, but you can save a lot of time by avoiding the regular queue.For lunch, we went to Mel's Drive-In. Its a fast food joint, and if you are lucky, you can eat while watching the waiters sing and dance (Mel's Dinettes)!My recommendations:1. I love Transformers The Ride the most! Its a 3D ride in a 16-people boat and we have to use a 3D googles to join the battles with Optimus Prime and Bumblebee! I love how there are background stories in every attractions in USS.2. The next one I'd like to recommend is Revenge of the Mummy. Its a roller coaster, so you have to store your belongings in a complimentary locker (all loose articles are prohibited during the ride). The ride is dark and exciting with a lot of sudden dropping and accelerations. But you won't know what will hit you because its dark down there.3. If you love roller coaster so much then go for the Battlestar Galactica! Unfortunately, I only get to ride the Human one because of bad weather, but the ride is still exciting nonetheless. The Cylon version is more extreme and I'm sure it will be much more exciting!I recommend you to ride all the top attractions in USS. If you ever watch the water world, please do seat in the front row for more exciting experience. Beware though you will definitely be soaking wet! You can also go for the Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure. You do not have to store your belongings in a locker (we have to pay $4 for this locker), but please note that your belongings will be wet during the ride. Another note: if you ever watch the Lights, Camera, Action! Do not go for the front row if you don't want to be wet~

review_440038182,“Good day out with kid”,"We took a 2 day fun pass and covered USS on the 2nd day. It was a Tuesday and USS wasn't very crowded. We did not see all the shows because they didn't sound very exciting; but did see some of the kiddo shows like ""When I grow up"". The rides were all good. Popular rides/ shows for children: A crate adventure, Madagascar Boogie, Meet and greet with Minions, Treasure hunters, water world, When I grow up, King Julien’s Beach party go-round, Dino soarin.Popular rides for everyone: Enchanted airways, Jurrasic Park Rapids adventure, Revenge of the mummy, Transformers, Battlestar Galactica.Battlestar Galactica is not for the weak hearts. Otherwise most of them can be done unless one has medical issues. USS does not allow any food/ drinks to be carried from outside. Water dispensers are available inside so carry am empty/ half full bottle. Indian food is not available inside and one will have to do with whatever is available at Discovery food court. Veg noodles was available but was full of mushroom.Overall, USS is a good place to spend your day in Singapore. Plan your day well though so you can have most fun.

The rides were fantastic, no lines at all during the whole day! The food was average in price and taste. However, on boarding the Jurassic Park Water Rapids ride, a male staff member was clapping his hands then pointing to the boat to grab guests' attention. I can understand using gestures to avoid a sore throat developing , however it is unacceptable to clap and point at guests like they are dogs. We have visited both LA and Orlando Universal studios and the staff friendliness there far exceeds Singapore's.

review_439647430,“Absolutely amazing and great fun”,"I went alone on a quiet weekday and it was fantastic. The general overall appearance of the theme park are amazing and very highly detailed...it was very visual.The rides were all so much fun and when I went I had two bonuses...one was it was very quiet on a weekday (still lots of people) but most rides were only a couple of min wait. Two was that they cater for single people...it was surreal as the single line often snakes through the buildings completely separate from others in groups...as in they didn't just go parallel.If you are an adult wanting to go on all the major rides once and see the wonderful Waterworld stunt show then it will take about half a day. I can well imagine families with kids taking the whole day and there are always rides one can go on a few times.The park really caters for all ages extremely well and with live shows everywhere and character appearances it was really a great day.The cost is what one expects from the theme park as are the food prices, merchandising and photo opportunities on the rides.I thoroughly recommend this amazing park.Oh and last of all is the good design...the entire park loops around a central lake so when you walk from themed area to the next they all come back to the start. Much better than similar theme parks I have been to where one has to constantly backtrack and waste time and energy.

review_439421389,“Single Rider Line!”,"I visited the Universal Studios Singapore (USS) on November 21, 2016. It is a Monday, and it was not as crowded.As I visited the park alone, I was able to take advantage of the Single Riders Line, which was offered by most of the rides, except for the Galactica roller coasters.I was able to complete most of the rides in a 3 hour time frame. I was also able to cut the 60 minute waiting time for the Jurassic Park water ride to 5 minutes.While it is not as big as the Universal Studios in Orlando, it retained the same flavour as the one that I visited in Orlando. The Mel's diner was exactly the same as the one in Orlando, which was amusing for me. The only difference is that the USS is in a country that is a lot hotter and very humid, which makes waiting in line for long periods unpleasant.One big plus for me was that the USS has free locker rentals for guests who are taking the rides. I actually thought that was a really nice touch. And the lockers are automated, utilizing fingerprint technology to lock and unlock the lockers. I do not recall seeing such lockers in Orlando, so this is definitely very appreciated. Overall, a great day spent at the USS, and I would recommend it to my friends and family. I would also recommend going on a weekday, so you do not have to jostle with the weekend crowds.

In Studios, there are many different themes, such as Transformers, Shrek, Madagascar and Sesame Street. There also are many actors at the street to take photo with you.If you like excite, you can play amusement rides or go to aquatic parks. If you just want to enjoy the atmosphere of Studios, you can go to 4DTheater, and I watched a movie call Shrek, it is very funny.This Studio is good places to take photo because of there have many styles; you must find a street that you like. You also can cosplay the actor that you like, or maybe you can join a special show that they hold.However, the worst thing is that there do not have many foods that you can choose, and all of this is expensive.

Having been to many theme parks and I rate this as very poor. Firstly overpriced for the size. Also many maintenance issues for example as you begin the Madagascar ride if you look up and to the right there a plug with nothing but electric tape hanging from it and at the end of the ride the sandpaper grip on the stairs is completely worn down. This is just one example but its so simple to fix. Mummy ride floor covered in black marks like candy or chewing gum also so dusty is some areas...looks so crap. Transformers switches on the way in most are broken. Food options are terrible, prices of everything ridiculous. I am happy to spend money on quality but there was just junk. We saw one character all day at opening of the park. Everything was money money money. If it wasnt for the waterworld(a lame movie from the 90s) show I would have given it a 1 star rating. Sorry never again for me, was boring and overrated so we cut our losses and left early to do something more fun.

There are 2 roller coasters and I would say go in the red one, as that is more dangerous. The transformers 4D ride is amazing and my little brother went 2 times. The queues are long, so better take an express ticket. The water ride in Jurassic Park is not worth the wait. WE had to stand for 2-3 hours in the queue and got very frustrated. The mummy ride is pretty good and you can visit it. When you enter Disney World, you had better do the Puss In Boots ride as that is very enjoyable and cute. The Madagascar world is not that great and suitable for small kids. The New York City is very good and there are also some American bands performing.

Its best to buy the tickets online in advance (saves valuable que time when you get there.. Best online option I found was Klook, which gave a 20% discount & issued single visit tickets with a 6 month entry date validity. Also, you will get ""influenced"" to buy the express add on tickets to avoid the long ques inside the park... Don't really have to fall for it.. It can get expensive at an additional SG$ 50 / head!! And you can only use the express option once for each ride. Essentially there are 5 - 6 rides that have the longest ques. If you can reach there by 10 am, & finish most of these rides before 11:30 am when there's lesser crowd, you save up-to SG $ 200 for a family of 4 like I did :-).So go ahead & have a blast..

There's the Sesame Street theater for the young kids and the battle star Galactica roller coaster ride. The waterworld show is great the cast interacts with the audience.

review_438206593,“Brings out the child in you! :)”,"I've visited a lot of theme parks by now and what I loved about Universal Studios was that this was not the regular theme park filled with attractions but actually has a lot of movie sets, characters, live performances & shows, souvenir shops and the entire experience just connects you to your favourite movies instantly! If you are a huge fan of high adrenaline attractions only - you might not like this place as much but otherwise it's worth every penny for an entire day of fun with family or friends. Some of the key attractions I loved - Transformers (you really feel you're in the movie - amazing effects), Revenge of the Mummy (completely dark in door roller coaster), Shrek 4D adventure (decent for a normal 4D theatre sitting experience)

review_438192613,“Awesome day at the USS!!”,"My partner and I came here a couple of days ago and had the most amazing day! The battlestar galactica roller coasters were awesome (cylon is the better of the two but start with human as it is less intense), the mummy rollercoaster was exciting (it is completely in the dark so it keeps you guessing and it is totally air conditioned) and the transformers ride will blow your mind. The puss in boots ride is a little bizarre but everything there is a lot of fun. Little tips, buy the express wristband so you don't have to wait in line, we never had to wait more than 5 minutes for any ride) also don't go when it's raining as they shut down the battlestar galactica roller coasters. Excellent day!!

Every crew member from the ticket counter to the ushers at the door were so enthusiastic and and happy to be there. It's looking like now most of them are bored with being there. I've met some really grumpy looking people today, mainly the assistants to the characters and the rides ushers. They don't even talk to you or ask you how many persons for the ride. They show you some number with their fingers. The park itself is very very well maintained after all these years and very clean still.

The rides appeared as they had been created on the 'cheap' with crappy movements (with the exception of the Madagascar ride).Lockers in the Revenge of the Mummy and the Rollercoaster were free for the 1st 45 minutes, but when we went to put bags in lockers for the Jurassic Park water ride, the price was $4 for an hour (no shorter times available or free minutes).

The entrance price is reasonable (paid SGD49) but express pass (top up SGD80) is expensive. It is very useful to skip the queues that can last up to 2 hours for one ride. So the express pass is a much helpful ticket (little to no wait).

The park was as expected, awesome. I have been to Disneyland, Knotts Berry Farm, and Universal Studios Los Angeles, and other parks around the world , so I love these kind of parks, and Universal Studios Singapore was in keeping with all of these. It is a bit smaller than the others l, but just as enjoyable. Too many highlights, Transformers ride, Battlestar Galactica, Jurassic Park, Shrek, and especially the Waterworld show. All of these on top of the awesomely themed areas and ambiance of the park made for an outstanding day. The only downfall is the cost of the souvenir photos they take of you.

review_436238810,"“Smallish park, avg value for money - a few cool experiences ”","Surprisingly small for a theme park (even smaller than Hong Kong Disneyland for those familiar) - nevertheless offers about average value for money. Don't come in expecting something like the original Hollywood park in the US or you will be disappointed - the iconic studio tour is missing for example. Taken on its own terms there are some fun experiences to be had.Standouts (you and your kids' mileage may vary depending upon how much you already love certain movies / characters):The Lost World / Jurassic Park Rapids ride - approaching the iconic gates with the Jurassic Park theme playing in the background made me feel like a kid again. The two giant T-Rex and Spinosaur statues in front of the food court that's made to look like the JB visitors centre (yeah there's even a T-Rex faux fossil skeleton as you enter!) pushed all my nostalgia buttons. My 5 year old loved the Jurassic Park Rapids ride.The Mummy roller coaster: Atmospheric and fun, not too intense (much like Disney's space mountain)Battlestar Galactica roller coaster: The one squarely aimed at adrenaline junkies; the Cylon track is the more intense of the two options Transformers the Ride: Surprisingly effective and fun mix of 3D and virtual motion based on the movie versions of these characters.Decent experiences:Madagascar carousel: Its a merry go round. With Madagascar themed characters and music - kids liked it Shrek 4D cinema: the seats moving with the action is a nice touch (still think HK Disney do it better with their philharmagic show but that's probably nostalgia bias)If you / your kids are big Shrek fans you may get a kick out of the full scale recreation of Shrek's hut (just external).Nothing to write home about: Just about everything else [note: the 'Lights, Camera, Action' attraction was closed on the day we went and we skipped the following as they just didn't excite us or our 5 year old: Puss in boots ride, Sesame Street stage show, JP canopy and dactyl ride, the mummy car ride].Tip: If you're willing to spend a bit more for the express tickets or use the single rider option to avoid the queues you can more or less be done by late afternoon / early evening.I really wish they would have more movie related references / replicas / props / characters in costume around the park. Their sound system is often playing iconic movie sound tracks which raises your expectations but with no pay-off. Oh wow there's the Back to the Future theme...is there a Delorean replica or the clock tower around the corner? Will I see someone in a Marty McFly costume? Uhhh no. Cool that's Danny Elfman's Batman theme from the '89 film...now where's the Batmobile!?!....(and so on, you get the idea).But they've randomly got a guy going around dressed as Beetlejuice and a lady dressed as Betty Boop (who? wha?...)

Din Tai Fung in front of the entrance is worth visiting. It is one of the famous dim sum franchise restaurants in Asia.

review_436021579,“okay.. nothing great.. not a number 1 place for sure”,"this was most awaited place for us on Singapore visit. it came bit of disappointment to me after visiting couple of rides there. lost of rides are simply time pass.. after waiting in long queues I didn't find rides worth. ticket price person is too much ... if you don't enjoy scary rides then you are left with only few option to enjoy. every thing sold there is very costly. place is very small. I heard so much about universal studios of paris and other placees this one is just a glimpus of it.

review_434955640,“Great day out”,"what a fun day. I think it was a great time of year to go. It was still quite humid, but day isn't in Singapore? We were lucky to not have any storms on the day there. It was crowded at all. We have hardly any lines for any of the rides. We were considering to get the express line passes. $70 for the unlimited pass, or $50 for the one time on all the rides pass. That's on top of the entry cost. We ended up not getting it as it was not needed at all. I would recommend it though if you have limited time and it's peak season.The major rides has lockers to lock up you bags and it was free for 45min. It worked well, we were able to go on the same roller coaster 3-4 times in the 45 mins. It was great.The park it set up around an artifical lake so it's easy to manouver around the park as you just walk around from area to area.The battlestar galactica ride was great. The cyclon side of the coaster is the best. If there was bit of a wait for a ride my husband and I just went in the single rider line as we were happy to be split up if needed. The lines for that was so much shorter and it didn't bother us to rider separately.The transformer ride is a must as well. Great 3D simulator ride. The Sesame Street ride is so cute. And it was fun having the characters to get photos with. The food selections in the place was good. We had turkey legs which were great.We spent about 6 hours there. That was plenty of time. That's with also going on the roller coasters many times over and over. It great for all ages as there are plenty of younger rides and stages shows to check out.When you have time in Singapore this is a great place to visit. Especially if you are going to Sentosa Island.

review_434729071,“First Sentosa Trip”,"Universal Studios Singapore on Sentosa is definitely the No. 1 fun attraction in Singapore. There are a variety of rides for kids and adults, one can spend an entire day here. As we were staying on Sentosa, we took the opportunity not to miss visiting Universal Studios. If you're staying on Sentosa, it's really easy to get to Universal as all the hotels offer shuttle rides from the resorts to Universal every half hourly.It's costs approx. SGD$ 70.00 per adult to get into Universal Studio. A child's entrance is half that. The park opens at 9am and closes at 7pm, so go as early if you intend to try all the rides.We went at 4pm as we did not intend to go on all the rides as our 3 year old boy could not get onto most the rides. We only ended up going on the Madagascar and Sesame Street rides. The remaining hours were used touring around Universal and buying souvenirs at the Universal Store. We passed the many rides and they all looked awesome. There was a Shrek ride, Jurassic Park, Ancient Egypt ride, Galactic Rocket ride etc. Its a pity the rides were mainly for teenagers and adults; not suitable for young children. As per other amusement parks, the lines are pretty long, even on the week day that we went. So bring lots of bottled water to hydrate yourselves as Singapore is very hot and humid just about all year through.Don't miss visiting Universal Studio if you're ever in Sentosa, Singapore. It's great fun!

My daughter loved the Puss in Boots ride so this was done more times than I can remember!The meet and greets were great with plenty of photo opportunities.The whole park is clean, well maintained and safe.If you visit midweek, out of season, you can easily get around the park in 1 day including seeing all the shows etc but if you're planning to visit at busier times i.e.. weekend (especially during summer hols) I would definitely recommend buying the Express pass.All in all, a memorable day out for all ages.

review_433457182,“Plan and visit the Halloween night early”,"It is definitely a great experience visiting the USS during one of the Halloween night. But be advise to plan ahead and go early. It is difficult to complete majority of the haunted houses and rides on a single night. The advice is to purchase the express pass. However, do take note the express pass is like stock price, the price will go up due to demand. The advertised price online was S $40 for express pass without rides. S $50 for express pass with rides. When I visited on Saturday 29 Oct 16, the price was S $120 for express pass without rides and S $140 for express pass with rides. See how much the price went up due to demand? The opening hours is from 0730pm till 0130am on Saturday. Normal day is till 1230am. So it is extremely difficult to cover many places since the long queue is about 2 hours each for the more popular haunted houses. So I suggest book the tickets early and buy express pass early so as to avoid disappointment. And bring rain coat during Halloween period as it usually rain at night.

The prayer room is separated from place you can take your wudhu, nearby toilet is at Hollywood Chinese restaurant. bring your own bottle of water to ease the process.5.

review_433310955,“Family Holiday to Singapore - Brilliant day at Universal Studios Park.”,"I would like to set the scene by saying I have visited universal studios in Florida. Admittedly it was over 25 years ago and, I do remember that holiday with rose tinted glasses. So what ever was happening Singapore's park had some living up to do....We visited the park midweek and during the rainy season, which I am guessing meant there was a reduced footfall. The 4 of us got a day pass for 260 SD. (about 155 quid). That was 2 adults and 2 juniors. Which sounds like lots of money but at the current exchange rate it really wasn't that bad. We used the MRT to get around Singapore for the 10 days we were there, but to get to Santosa Island we took the Santosa Express, this is an additional 4 dollar charge. Alternatively you can also walk for free or take a taxi.As you approach the spinning universal globe outside its nothing short of amazing. A huge photo opportunity! The park was everything you would expect to see at these these places. The kids were literally bouncing. The themed areas worked nicely. We all loved Donkey and his experience at the theatre. There aren't absolutely loads of coasters but there is a healthy mix meaning we could all go on almost everything together. Our youngest is 5. We waited very little time at all for any of the rides dispite the park feeling fairly busy. As with most attractions in Singapore if there is a lightening storm the rides etc get shut down. This happened to us and there was some quite heavy rain. We just scheduled our lunch into the storm, and by the time it finished so did we.We managed to ride pretty much every ride. The longest wait we had on the day was less than 20 mins. The rides were all pretty good. Kids both loved the Transformers ride. I also got to meet a Marilyn Monroe look alike. #chuffed.What a great day out. As a grown up I enjoyed the park as much as young me did the Florida park way back then...

review_433164341,“Halloween Horror Nights 6”,"Although the starting DJ segment is a bit overlong (not really my cup of tea) the rest of the experience was great, the haunted houses was well designed and the attention to detail in the props and decoration used was great. I went during off peak days (it was thursday night), so I have more chance to enjoy the ambience and overall 'feel' of the park, still, other guests keep bumping into me from behind and forcing me to move ahead, I can only imagine it gets worse at busy nights.Minor complaints, the smoke machine produced some awful smelling smokes (at least for me), and there are many empty and unused area (which is understandable), maybe next year more area will be used

review_433157775,"“Don't wait in line, get an Unlimited Express pass”","From VivoCity it is just a few minutes on the special monorail to the park, a return ride cost 4S$.It was Halloween so tickets were a bit more expensive although we did not attend the horror nights after 7:30pm. We bought a standard ticket S$70 and express pass S$50 online. At the park we decided to upgrade for 20S$ extra and get the unlimited pass as the other pass only allows you to skip the queue 1 time per selected attractions. The feeling of skipping every line was amazing, although it was not crazy busy, waiting in line with screaming kids, people sweating as it's 30 degrees is not fun. We usually waited around 3-5 minutes. In 6 hours we did all the attractions and shows and most rides we did 2 or 3 times. As you cannot bring your bags or anything loose on the ride, you need to put them away in the free lockers near the rides. This included both dueling roller coasters and The Mummy Ride. It's okay to wear hats/glasses which you can leave behind before you step into the ride. For Jurassic Park you can take them with you but a big chance you get wet. You can buy a poncho in the vending machine. Must visit is also the show Waterworld, very entertaining, just don't sit in the splash zone or you might get soaking wet.The park is absolutely beautiful, all English, clean and well maintained, will recommend it to everyone looking for adventure and adrenaline! After you leave the park there are plenty of other things to do and see on the island.

review_433157736,“Michael kelly”,"We were charged what I believe was an excessive entry fee. Once entering we were confronted with up to 90 minutes waiting time for the rides - included in this was a 20 minute wait for a basic hot dog. Heaven forbid if we had thought to frequent one of the restaurants. We waited for over an hour for the Transformers ride which at times gave myself and my wife claustrophobia as we were herded like cattle through queues. Finally there was nothing that even resembled a healthy food option. In conclusion the worst place we have visited on any of our many overseas trips. We opted to leave and spend an extra 4 hours at the airport, rather than continue our time there.

review_433149479,“Halloween Horror Nights 6 was lots of spooky fun! :)”,"I visited USS with friends for the Halloween Horror Nights 6 events and had a great time. I strongly suggest joining the queue at the entrance by 6.30pm even though the doors open at 7pm as a huge crowd will form by then. The night kicks off with a very crowded (and very warm!) DJ party at 7.10pm and opening ceremony at 7.30pm, so wear sensible walking shoes, keep your belongings close to you at all times and bring some water with you to keep hydrated and cool (drinks are available to purchase on site but very expensive at 6.50SGD for a bottle of water!).I highly recommend purchasing the express queue add-on as my friends and I thought it was definitely worth it to be able to complete ALL 5 haunted houess (Hawker Centre Massacre, Salem Witch House, Hu Li's Inn, Old Changi Hospital and Bodies Of Work) in one night in addition to the Suicide Forest, Scared Shrekless (a Halloween exclusive showing) and some other rides. The express queue gets you into the haunted houses within 5 minutes, whereas for the normal queue you could be queueing for up to 2 hours to get into the more popular haunted houses such as Old Changi Hospital.Out of the 5 haunted houses, I enjoyed Hu Li's Inn the most personally as I thought the sets and costumes were very pretty with a twisted macabre feel to them (loved the mirror maze!). I didn't find any of the haunted houses scary (my friends did though and screamed a lot), but that's mainly because I'm quite desensitised to horror movies (one of the boys jokingly complained I was too brave for a girl haha). However, I did appreciate the huge amount of effort and detail they must have put into the designs of the haunted houses, especially for Old Changi Hospital where even the graffiti on the walls is said to be an exact replica of the real thing. Have a action plan just in case it rains (the outdoor rollercoasters all close when this happens) as we were caught up in heavy rain towards the latter end of the evening and quickly rushed indoors to see the Nightmare Circus act. On the whole, Halloween Horror Nights at USS was lots of spooky fun! :)

review_432293169,"“Amazing Rides, Unforgettable Experience”","Very well maintained Theme Park with lots of different kind of rides.I would recommend Battlestar Galactica and The Revenge of The Mummy for all of the adrenaline junkies out there. This theme park was so crowded even on weekdays, so I'll suggest you to come as early as possible. You probably want to take some pictures in front of the 'popular' USS globe and after the gate open, go straight to Battlestar and Mummy rides because they are the most popular rides (i think). The most popular water ride is Jurrasic Park Rapids Adventure. Around 3 pm the queue was sooo long, it would take around 1.5 hours to get to the end so I decided not to take it.Some of the rides don't allow you to bring your bags and other items (even phone!) so they prepare lockers you can rent.

review_432286377,"“Great rides, all level of thrills - get a Fast Pass though”","We had a thoroughly enjoyable day at Universal Studios on Sentosa Island, Singapore. The park opened at 10am and we were there ready for the gates to open. There were queues already, so by the time we made inside, we headed to the first ride which was Sesame Street Spaghetti Space race. Very cute ride and fun for all ages. The next ride was Transformers 3D so we jumped in the queue. After a short while in the queue, there was an announcement that the wait time was one hour 15 minutes but we decided to hang in there, assuming that the queue would only get longer. It did indeed get longer and it took us nearly 2 hours in the queue to get to the ride. Transformers is an awesome ride but we figured that we would never get around the whole park if we had to wait 2 hours for each of the big thrill rides. So we purchased an Express pass to get us through the queues more quickly - but one time per ride only. You can get an unlimited fastpass but we decided not to do that option. This meant that we started at the gates again and went the opposite direction and managed to get onto all the rides with a waiting time of less than 20 minutes for each ride. Some we were able to walk straight on and others we still had to queue such as Transformers (yes, we did go back) the Battlestar Galactica duelling coasters, Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, Revenge of the Mummy. Food options at Universal were the usual park fare, but toilets were clean and there were plenty of water bubblers scattered around. Best rides were Transformers, Revenge of the Mummy and the Cylon version of the Battlestar Galactica rollercoasters (which was weird because it had the shorter lines).I would recommend you stay as long as possible because after we used our fastpasses up, close to closing time you could go on any ride without any wait as most people have left.Quick tip - if you are looking for a cheap and easy feed that is NOT in the park (either on your way back to your hotel or come out during the day) I totally recommend Malaysian Food Street with authentic hawker dishes that taste delicious and are inexpensive.

review_432062877,“Great day out ”,"Made my first visit to a universal studios and was not completely disappointed. It was great to go on a Tuesday when there was not too many crowds but this still made the wait for some rides from 10-55 minutes.... I was surprised the rides were so short, in most cases the rides ranged from 30 seconds to 60 seconds, so after a wait for 1 hour the 60 second ride seem to have lost its shine.... The most amazing ride with the shortest wait was the Transformers ride, it was so unexpectedly great my friends and I lined up and did it twice.... Definitely recommend that one.... As you can expect the food variety is not great and expensive and considering you can't take food into the park, you better be prepared for fried foods......Did not manage to see any of the street shows, was too busy queuing up for rides, so was a little disappointed there was not that much happening outside the rides..... The friends I was traveling with, who are seasoned movie studios regulars, said it was more of themed park than anything to do with studios or shows like you see in the states. Was it worth the $75 yes I would say, but Only because it was not a busy day, had it been busy you would struggle to get on 3or 4 rides in a day.

review_431125267,“Good Family Day Out”,"Universal Studios Sentosa is very similar to Movieworld on the Gold Coast in Australia. There are the usual movie streets and lots of rides. Highly recommend you buy the Express Pass up front (you will need to purchase this on top of the entrance ticket) as the more people that arrive on the day, the more expensive the express pass becomes .. the prices goes up on any given day depending on the crowds, so do yourself a favour and buy it before you get there to save time and money. The Transformer Ride is probably the best ride there and recommend you go there first. Food and Beverages are reasonably priced. There is also a Starbucks there. There is no backlot studio, so it is really an amusement park with lots of rides. Take plenty of sunscreen and water as it gets very hot. Allow a whole day to enjoy all rides.

review_430532462,“Must visit place and here is the plan / itinerary / strategy”,"First the review, it was very fun and enjoyable day in USS. From the rides to the show and performances to the photos with live characters, we enjoyed every bit of it.USS is not that big, but covering all the things is bit difficult without a plan in a day.Here are the tips to make most out of a day visit and to help you prepare a plan.Some preparations...1. Book your tickets online, from official website or from klook.com to get cheaper rates.2. Try to go on week days and not on weekend or holidays.3. Have good breakfast and have some food/supplies packed in a bag, if you don't want to waste time in proper lunch and dinning (at least 1:30 hour). No need to pack water bottles, you just need one bottle which can be re-filled at water fountains at various places in USS (Free). 4. Wear comfortable attire. It may be hot outside so come prepared.5. Get map online and study a bit. It is bit tedious but type the attractions in YouTube and watch the video to get idea about attraction. By watching you get to know if that's your cup of tea or not. ;)Now tips to enjoy as many attractions as possible and our experience...6. Reach there by 9.15. You can take pictures of the Universal globe before entry and after exit in the evening.7. Queue around 9:30-9:40 (or early): I know it's too early, but trust me when you will see the crowd (even on week days) you will thank me. 8. Enter at 10: If you have bought tickets online you can show it on your phone, the bar code will be scanned for entry, no need to get any paper or tickets separately.9. Get the map : Just when you cross the entry point where you showed your ticket (bar-code), take maps from the stand on your right side. Don't forget to take small single paper which has all the shows timings.10. Don't take pictures, I repeat, Don't take pictures : No matter what, control yourself from taking out your cameras. I know this is hard but your first priority is to finish with attractions. You will get more than enough time for pictures in second half. Again trust me if you wait a little for pictures you will face 30 to 60 minutes of queue in every attractions. The rides are not even 1 min long but the queue might be 30 mins.Now the execution with some declaimers... - USS is not big as I said, we are around 27 old and we are lazy couple but still it was not hard to walk around. So if you can, you don't have to follow linear direction. - We don't have kids so we gave importance to adults rides. Following is the order in which if you follow you will be free by around 2 with important attractions.11. Transformers: The Ride (Sci-fi City) - This is the best and popular ride. So run for it after step 9. This may be crowded but don't be disappointed it's worth the queue. (We did not follow step 7 so we faced 30 min queue.) Here you need to leave your belongings in locker. The lockers are charged based on time. Lucky part is for early time you will get free locker for some time.12. Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride (Ancient Egypt) : This is interesting and not that scary. This ride is in dark, not scary but it has element of surprise. Again here as well you will need to leave your belongings in locker and you will need to pay. Buy only 1 hour for 4 SGD and keep all the belongings in locker here including cameras and electronics. This is for next ride.13. Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (The Lost World): This is slow ride but at the end you may get wet (not too much). So the step 12 above where you have kept all the things in locker will save some dollars for ponchos. You don't need to buy ponchos, you will dry out in the sun outside in few minutes.14. Canopy Flyer (The Lost World): The lost world is not straight forward also not much tricky. Find this attarction and have fun. Tip is to get front rows (Entry point 1 & 3). If you don't get, just get in the queue and let others go.Now this is the point where you have beat the queue and finished major attractions. Rest attractions will have queues but will move faster. Now check the show timings of shows and look for must see show - Water worldNow after this show it was time when we thought we have finished important attractions and it was worth the ticket price we paid. All the other rides and shows we enjoyed was sort of add-on. You will have now enough time for other things and photos. But still check the timings of shows and follow the plan.Here is our experience. Tip is to have pics at the end of the show with the characters. Queue starts where the attendants are ;)1:15 PM - Waterworld2:00 PM - Madagascar Boogie!2:45 PM - The Minions3:30 PM - AUTOBOTS, Roll Out!4:30 PM - Meet Diane, Jurassic Park's Newest Addition!4:40 PM - The Dance For The Magic Beans5:00 PM - Look out! Velociraptors have escaped in Jurassic Park!5:25 PM - Sesame Street Stage Shows5:25 PM - Sesame Street Meet and Greet5:40 PM - Mel's DinettesIn between we were finishing the rides and photos. We finished following rides.- Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase- Battlestar Galactica: HUMAN- Battlestar Galactica: CYLON- Treasure Hunters- Shrek 4-D Adventure- Enchanted Airways- Puss In Boots' Giant Journey- Madagascar: A Crate Adventure- Lights! Camera! Action! Hosted by Steven SpielbergIf you have kids then here are some rides for them..- Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase- Treasure Hunters- Amber Rock Climb- Dino-Soarin'- Shrek 4-D Adventure- Magic Potion Spin- King Julien's Beach Party-Go-RoundAt last I would like to thank all the reviewers on USS, your reviews helped me a lot for preparation.

Whatever we did we had a great time!We loved the madagascar crate adventure ride! Then the shrek 4-d movie! followed by the puss in boots ride, the awesome steven spielberg set 'lights camera action', egyptian explorer jeep ride. The lines at the rides were not long - not too many tourists were around. I am sure it would be very crowded during peak seasons. Do not miss!

review_430222041,“Staff attitude at a new low!”,"Took my kid on a 3-day trip in Singapore. Naturally, Universal Studio was among the top of the list. Mid-October heat was almost too unbearable even for a person living in SE Asia. The queue was not long for the popular roller coaster rides or 4D theaters. I didn't mind the fact that the place is not on par with Universal Studio in the US. That, I could understand. But what I couldn't hack was the fact that staff attitude must have been at an all-time ""low"". Most if not all have appeared as if they were forced to come to work. Words uttered from their mouth were not welcoming. Their body language suggested they were reprimanding naughty students rather than their paying customers. People came here to have a good time with their loved ones. There shouldn't be things to spoil their good spirit.....particularly, from the crew staff.Tried the food at the outlet behind the giant T-Rex. The food was edible but the Manager should be there to supervise their cleaner not to make screeching sound by dragging or pushing the chairs and tables while they are cleaning. This has made an unpleasant dining experience.

review_430185147,“HHN6 & RIP Tour”,"It was an excellent choice to have the RIP Tour where you can get to all haunted houses and skip all the long lines. The best part about the tour is also the amazing guide, Rashid. He went beyond expectations and extra mile to entertain not only us but other guests while an attraction broke down. He did bring in some entertainment to the crowd while we were waiting for Jack's show at Pantages to start as well. This is why everyone (his colleagues especially) adores him! Haunted houses were unique but tiny and low ceilings for certain areas. There were way too much smoke going on making it difficult to breathe and see. There should be more going on in the scare zone. Kinda miss the scare zone during HHN2! The opening act was amazing! Something like that could have been set up at Ancient Egypt, opposite Revenge of the Mummy. It was too quiet in that area. Overall, great job, my friends and I enjoyed ourselves!

review_429698848,“Amazing theme park”,"We were a bit skeptical to go to Universal Studios during our time in Singapore as we were weary of the common pitfalls of theme parks in genera (crowded, disorderly, dirty, overpriced, unbearably long waiting times), however to our surprise we encountered none of these setbacks during our trip. The park is very well set out and a decent amount of rides and attractions are there to enjoy throughout a full day. The rides are all very enjoyable (particular favourites were The Mummy and Battlestar Galactica) and the amount of effort taken to ensure each ride and its respective waiting area was decorated to suit each respective theme was outstanding. Moreover, there are a few very reasonable food options available - we went to a chinese restaurant near the entrance of the park which came to a fair price given we were in a theme park. Moreover, the staff is very attentive and helpful. All in all, an extremely enjoyable day at Universal Studios. Would definitely recommend.

review_429674557,“Amazing time in Universal studios with family”,"It was great to visit this place specially for my kids. If you want to enjoy all attractions reach early to this place because it closes at 6 pm and there is usually long queues at popular attractions. If you already can estimate the rush then I would recommend to purchase express tickets otherwise you will end up waiting in long queues. Another option is to use single rider line. This is normally fast compared to regular one. Kids below certain height/age are not allowed in many rides. So people going with kids should already check the rides where everybody can enjoy. I could experience the transformer, lost world and medagaskar sections. The transformer ride was really amazing.

Imagine to finish all the sequence will take almost 13 hours. We went to buy the express ticket, they mark up the price from 30 Sing Dollar to 50 Sing Dollar + 103 USD already paid total 153 USD, after buying the pass we still could complete all the sequence. it was sheer waste of money. Universal studio guy should limit the same of ticket per day. It feel cheated after paying 103 Sing Dollar and have to wait in queue. Infact the timing are too short from 10 am to 6 pm. it should open till mid night in order to enjoy the same.

review_428783884,“Three days @singapore with 7months baby.. ”,"Hi.. looking for a trip to singapore,here are some quick tips.  We were 3 adults and 1 infant and we were travelling from Kualalumpur,Malaysia.As we planned our trip 2 days prior to our date of journey,flight price was high.so we travelled by bus which is RM 54/pax.we started at 5pm and it took around 5 hours (including immigration time).We have to get down twice (KL border and Singapore border).so by the time we reached our hotel (Little India) it's been 11.30pm.If you have kids or infants,carry all their stuff (water,food,snacks,diapers,extra clothes,baby fan).Food is not allowed inside but if you have infants and small kids,they will permit.DAY 1:Morning we reached UNIVERSAL STUDIOS at 9.30am by local bus.We purchased entry ticket and there was not much queue.They give some free shopping and food coupons which can be used inside. please carry umbrella/hats as the sun is so horrible and try to wear cotton clothes.We get water bottles and food there but a bit expensive.And after all stuff. .coming to our favourite rides,there are many rides and each ride has its speciality.TIP:If you are single to go for a ride,your queue will be very less.And if you are couple and more,have to queue. (Go as single one after other and mostly u get seated side by side)1.Roller coaster: there are 2 types of roller coasters..Blue and Red..but there was very big Queue.we were almost in queue for 2 hrs 15min,its better to avoid those who are weak hearted .2.Transformers Ride: I say this is the best ride.You will b atmost thrilled. Transformers lovers,don't miss this ride.3.Mummy ride: Little scary ride.4. zoorasic park: kids enjoy this. There are many more rides for kids . There is also a bollywood film making show (sitting in first 1 to 5 rows get wet) There are open cage birds,Tiger,train rides etc.There is dolby atmos 4d movie.And in the evening, we went to Casino.Day 2:We had our breakfast and went to dolphin show at 10.30.Actually it should be named seol show ;),It was $35 for entry fee and you can visit Aquaria after that.If you have visited aquarias at Kualalumpur or other place..better skip this and use your time and money for other place.Afternoon we had our lunch near santosa as for dolphin show there are free buses to/from santosa. After that we explored some new places near white sand beach.And went to marine bay..from there,they take on boats across Singapore night life/light's . Laser show is good but I expected much as it's a tourist attraction.DAY 3:We went to Little India for some shopping.Gold designs are awesome over there.Am a bit gold lover (collection).Then some malls.went to flower garden and created snowfall cool place and Gardens By the Bay.It is good place with various colours of light. We returned Kualalumpur by flight.Hope this helped you out to plan your trip.All the Best and safe journey.

Their features were almost different except for some major attractions like The Mummy and Waterworld. I really enjoyed my visit in the USS. I just hoped that I have more time as 10am-4pm was never enough because of very long lines.

There are many thrilling rides like the Battlestar Galactica Human VS Cyclon. The Cyclon is quite more scarier than the human because it goes upside down. The Revenge of the Mummy is not for the young because of the frightening seeing. The Jurassic Park Ride was really cool but you do get soaked. The puss'n'boots ride is good for the young with small turns and speed. The canopy flyer is a lamer ride but really good for the young.

review_428335468,“Fun day for the kids!”,"We went there on a weekday so it was not too crowded. We followed their recommendation and rented a stroller for our 4 year old so that we could push her around rather than tire her out walking around half a day. We purchased the Universal Express tickets which allowed us to the fast lane for the rides which saved us a lot of time! Some rides were very popular and waiting times for the popular rides ran up to 60 minutes. Food inside the theme park was average but i guess no one goes there looking for great food. Overall, it is possible to finish off the park in a day at a leisurely pace. There's something for all ages in the park.
