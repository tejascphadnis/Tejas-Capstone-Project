review_428301447,“Best roller coasters!!”,"We bought the express pass so no queues. This is a must!!With 8 days holiday we bought the 6 month pass so we'll be back again in a few months to get our money's worth. This is our 3rd trip in 2 years. Cylon is a favourite! The Mummy and Transformers are also family favourites. Such a safe environment our kids 11&13yrs went on their own at times. Great fun thing to do.

review_428298452,“Excellent option for 1 fun day”,"We took public transport to get to the park and visited Universal on a Sunday. It was quite busy but never had to wait longer than 30 minutes. Best activity is Transformers but Jurassic park is fun, too. You do not actually get soaking wet as they warn you. This Universal is not as big as in the USA but perfect to have a nice day without getting too tired of waiting for all the activities. Arrived at 11, left at 4.30. The train that takes you there costs 8 dollars, on the way back we preferred to walk as in the queque we would have waited longer than taking the nice 15 minutes walk to leave Sentosa island

review_428254029,“Everything we hoped and more!”,"Really great venue for family, definitely recommend arriving early and of course you need the express passes.The express passes vary between $30 and $90 per person depending on demand.However they are well worth it as we were able to move through and see everything without having to wait in long lines within 5 hours.

review_428087330,“Great if you like the rides”,"This is really one for the kids. As mum I went along because the kids were keen to go. Most rides had a queue of some sort, but getting the ""Jump the Queue/Express"" ticket helped to reduce waiting time. NOTE: It is better to purchase your Express ticket before you go - on the website the Express tickets were $SG30 and at the gate they were $SG70! We found this out the hard way.Take a water bottle, and fill it up at the various drink stations around the park.

review_428066891,“Not a great amusement park”,"My family and I all had high hopes for this amusement park as everyone in KL was saying that it was great. We decided to stay a weekend in Singapore and this was one of the first places we came. The line for the tickets was so long, which is quite normal at an amusement park, but when it was our turn and we had to pay I was shocked by how much it costed for 4 tickets. However we bought them, went in and were surprised by how few good rides there actually were. I was expecting more and hope that Universal Studios Singapore does something to make it better. The minion place was great and so was Elmo street: there were nice places but again, no rides. Also Singapore is unpredictable with rain and most rides become closed when it rains.

review_428046354,"“Amazing, full day activity- Must visit in Singapore.”","Family looking for thrill, fun , relaxing outing for whole day, please head to Universal studio. Must visit in Singapore.Reaching Universal studio by MRT is easier and at an average takes around 45 minutes. Head to Harbor front station and from Vivo city mall level 3, take Sentosa Express. (One stop from Vivo city).When we went on Monday (Avoid weekends and Holidays as que for rides would be longer!) there was not much q in ticket counter. Please be there around 9.30 am as studio opens at 10 am. Half an early helps you take ticket and snaps near the entrance.There are different types of rides- Thrill rides like Transformer, Egyptian Mummy ride, Sci-fi ride, and not so thrill, dizzying , yet enjoyable ride like Jurassic park, Enchanting airways and for various rides and shows for kids . Most of the thrill rides will have long q and waiting time over one hour. Waiting time is displayed near the entrance of each ride and it matches with the actual waiting time.Brave hearts ,once you enter, head to sci fi, rides, where the waiting time is quite longer.(Avg waiting time at any given time is 110 minutes) . Transformer ride is quite popular and have a waiting time of 100 to 110 minutes. we did this ride at lunch time as that, time waiting time was 45 minutes. Weak hearts, you may skip some rides in Sci fi , but don't miss any thrill rides like transformer, Mummy, Enchanting airways and some rides in Jurassic park.KIds below 10- 12 years have many options in studio with slow rides, shows , walk, and parade of cartoon character etc. Parents, please see the schedules and plan your activities.Don't miss show at water front station and 4 D show at castle. Food is expensive so as souvenirs. We had food near Ancient Egypt. Food was ok and ambiance was good. We had late lunch as we focused on popular ride at lunch time, when q is shorter.While return we took free bus ride to Vivo city mall as Sentosa express was crowded and long q to board the train and spent an hour or two in Vivo city mall, before heading to Hotel for much needed rest.Master card holder and holder of boarding pass of certain airlines will get 10 % discount on entry ticket.

review_428032012,“Wow attraction”,"If you are in Singapore you just cannot miss Universal Studios. Suitable for all ages, it is better you plan for 2 days for this huge entertainment park. The must do activities are Transformers ride, Mummy roller coaster, Madagascar Crate ride, Shrek 4D Show, Puss in the Boots ride and the Water ride in Jurassic park.Be warned there is lots and lots and lots of walking, so better take a stroller if you have kids with you.Better make the tickets online in advance which is also cheaper. Get a combo ticket of Sentosa island and Universal Studios in the official website of Resort World Sentosa:

review_427758845,"“I've been to the Universal Studios in California, and this one blew that out of the water.”","The park is far bigger than I expected, the lines were smaller and the wait time was far more accurate. There will always be wait times for popular rides, but the best time to go is early and on a weekday. If you do weekends, there will be 3 times more people. The food in the park was expensive, but not more than I expected for being inside a theme park. That is normal. Overall, this was one of the best theme park experiences I've had! Also, in October, they have a Halloween night event where they reopen the park, decked out in Halloween decorations and haunted houses! We will be going back for that tonight.

review_427674066,“Great entertainment for kids and their childish parents :)”,"Sentosa Island is all about entertainment and Universal Studios Singapore is a pinnacle of that entertainment.It is a relatively small place, you can visit all of the attractions in just one day if you plan carefully and are determined. The main obstacles are the crowds, especially on weekends (Fridays included). At the most popular attractions you can expect lines up to 2h long.The ways of beating up the crowds are:1. Come on a weekday in low season (google up the seasons and crowd estimations)2. Come early - 15 minutes before opening and run, start with the most popular attractions. Google up the popularity of the attractions.3. Buy Universal Express or Universal Express Unlimited passes. They ARE expensive, they may easily double the entrance price, but if you have little time (as we had) they make all the difference. They allow entry to the attractions with no or almost no waiting (in our case: max 15 min).If you are a Pokemon Go player, there are some rare Pokemon spawning in USS in the morning, just after opening. If you need Pikachu, this is the way to go. Also, there are lots of Pokemon spawning everywhere across the park all the day long, many of them rare.

review_427459838,“Super duper experience”,"One of a best theme park on the world. Here are few advises. It'll start at 10am. So get you ticket arranged atleast before 9.45. Get a map. And quickly go to the queue. And if you can run to the transformer ride. Because it is the longest queue in the universal studio. And it is the best 4d ride in universal studio. Then go to the rollercoaster if you wish. Go to the cylon. Because it is the most thrilling one. After the head to the mummy ride. Then the rush items are over. At about 12pm and 3pm there is a water show @water world.Go for it. Superb real show. But Brace your self to get wet. It is very hard to do all the activities in one day. So make sure you do all the best activities.

review_427253427,“Thanks Optimus Prime!”,"My little devils ages 6 and 8 absolutely love this park. Managed to go for all the rides suited for their age/height. Bought tickets online from Klook.com. Got there just before park open. Went there on a weekday. Did not get express pass as it was not crowded. Managed to do some rides multiple times. Park did get crowded towards lunch time. Transformer Ride was excellent and a hit with my kids. Other rides were good too. Would give this park a 5 rating, however it is let down by poor dining options- food court is terribly expensive and food taste like CRAP! You cannot bring in any kind of food into the park except water.(yes, staff will check your bags at entrance) If you want, get a re-entry stamp and eat outside, cheaper and more options. Also not many characters mascot walking around like Minions, Transformer, etc. They all have timetable. So if you miss timing, you have to wait around until they return. So annoying! Also don't bother buying a poncho for Jurassic Park river raft ride, you won't get totally drenched, just a splash or two. Did not bother about renting their lockers either as I had a waterproof back pack.Overall, a nice and enjoyable theme park, especially for kids and those young at heart!

review_427192723,“Enjoyable but bring your patience”,"The rollercoasters were the highlight for us. Went on a Wednesday and longest we waited for anything was 30min (average of 5-15min), so glad we didn't pay for an express pass, as it wouldn't have been worth it for our visit. Waits definitely got worse as the day went on, so arrive early if you can.Bought our tickets in advance online to save $ and time. Was disappointed to find that the queue to redeem our purchase was longer than the actual ticketing counters on arrival.The real spoiler for us though were the large groups of travellers with absolutely no manners or etiquette. These groups were seriously 80% of visitors and all day we were subjected to 8-12ppl pushing in front of us at each ride. Their tactic is to have someone wait in line and at the last minute a horde of ppl run up the express lane and jump the barrier into the normal queue, increasing your wait time. Staff should curb this behaviour through better crowd control.Another unpleasant and frequent occurrence were the selfie sticks being shoved in front of my face on the more tame rides blocking my view. The culprits were of course the very same visitor ""groups"" who defy staff instruction and seem to have a personal mission to ruin everyone else's experience. For these reasons, we will never return.We found staff friendly and helpful, but food crap/overpriced. Suggest exiting for lunch and then reentering to continue your day. Lockers should also be free, though this didn't affect us on a weekday given fairly short wait times. Travel light if coming at peak times or be prepared to fork out to store your belongings!

review_427173238,"“Get there at opening times, with a Express Pass, and have tons of fun”","Simply going to and coming from the Universal Studios Singapore, you're in for a treat, as Sentosa Island is gorgeous.You can find some really good deals online, with up to 15 SGD cheaper per person.The park is not that large, but it is packed with rides, restaurants, shops and attractions for all ages to enjoy. With an express pass, you'll need around 4.5 hours to go around. The best rides are, as you would expect, Transformers, Galactica, Jurrasic Park and also the Ancient Egypt ride. Far Far Away and Penguins of Madagascar are also very cool. Use the Galactica lockers, as they are free.Also, take some time between the rides to walk the tiny streets on Hollywood/New York, or enjoy lunch/coffee at one of the many restaurants.

review_427098163,“Absolute heaven for big and little kids”,"Big and little kids alike had an amazing time at Universal studios. Arrive early so you can purchase tickets and get in line for 10am opening. When purchasing We visited just after Singapore school holidays and a public holiday, and 5 days before the formula one event, so luckily wasn't as busy as we thought it was going to be. We ended up not purchasing the fast track tickets as we tried to do visit most rides and shows before it got busy around midday. Not all rides open early, so make sure you get in line when they do, such as the Lost world rides. Heres a good tip if your happy to risk not riding together with family and friends - use the single lane tickets. When it got busy this is what we did to fast track rides, otherwise the wait was more than half an hour. Loved the transformer, mummy rides if your a bit more adventurous and Shrek rides with the younger kids. The Waterworld show was spectacular and the initial pre entertainment before the show started was hilarious - make sure you sit out of the wet zone if you want to not get wet !!!!!The Egypt and Lost World areas were our favourite of all shows snd rides. Recommend buying the slurpie refill if you want to top up drinks.We also got to Unviersal studios via vivi city via the walking travellator, which the kids thoroughly enjoyed.Also we had many opportunities to take photos with the Transformers, Frankenstein, Minions...would have been nice to see more characters roaming around

We did get the fast pass but probably didn't need it even though it was Aussie school holidays. We were expecting long lines but that was only for a couple of the more popular rides and I'm really talking about waiting maybe 10-15 mins tops. Perhaps do your homework first and see if the locals have a designated holiday or not, it might determine whether you need one. If you're after a proper 'meal' there are a number of venues just outside in the open air mall which I'd recommend.

review_426259875,“Probably the best attraction in Singapore”,"If you are travelling with kids and young adults, this is a must see. Well organized, clean and safe place.Tickets are costly, we got a deal from klook and booked online in advance. It was a weekday and didn't opt for express pass. The maximum wait time for us was may be 40 minutes, but on an average 15-20 minutes if you are not opting for an express pass on a weekday. As we had 4 of us, it would have been another $120 to shell out, we thought we will not buy and shop with that instead!!The rides are excellent,please wear clothes and shoes which are water friendly as in many places you will get really wet and sometimes soaked. You may carry empty water bottles as there are many water dispensers to fill them up. For the elderly crowd, this may be a really tiring one as Singapore is a hot and humid place and some of the rides go really fast. There are plenty of food places around, if you are not a vegetarian then you wont find any issues with food. USS is a full day attraction and if you can spend a whole day here, I am sure you can cover all the rides and still have plenty of time to walk around for photo opportunities.

review_425964538,“A bit disappointed ”,"Landed in Singapore in the morning and headed straight here after dropping our luggage off. Entrance was fairly swift and the place was certainly buzzing. But once inside the park, we very quickly found that the choice of white knuckle rides was fairly limited. Having been to Universal in Florida, was somewhat disappointed with the choice. The cyclone roller coaster had to be the highlight although quite a short ride. And the transformers 3d ride was up there as well. The lockers system was chaos and though free at some of the rides, they were an exorbitant $4 on other rides. Definitely left a sour taste as you are almost forced by the staff to use them, even when it isn't deemed necessary. Food wise we opted for Goldilocks for the Halal option. Standard fare fried chicken and fries. $50 and we were on our way again. At the end, a 40 min wait for a taxi from a very humid basement parking area. Cheap fare and the queue moved along swiftly but it was long. Still feel it's a must do attraction but don't expect it to be on par with the US or even Alton Towers etc

review_425832645,“Amazing experience”,"We went to universal studios for its halloween horror night, all the rides were open, and most of them took less than 5 minutes of waiting time. The haunted houses and forests, are one of the most surreal and amazing haunted houses I've ever been to.

review_425830760,“Good but small”,"We came here on a Thursday right at the opening time and managed to complete the entire park with double rides on a few of the attractions by 6pm. It was good from that perspective and am glad that we didn't spend the extra cost of the express passes as the wait time for most rides was only about 20mins (some as short as 5mins with the longest being 1hr for the big roller coaster). Food and drinks are stupidly expensive so would suggest getting a day stamp and heading out to the Malaysian Hawker Food Street just outside the main gate to eat an the going back in.

review_425752310,“Halloween Horror Night”,"This was my 5th visit to USS and the best yet. Despite the heat and the queues (which were bearable), the attractions were simply fantastic. The horror houses were so detailed and well acted and the overall atmosphere was so very well crafted.The top regular attractions were also open for business with queues less than a day time visit.My 13 year old son and I had one of the best nights of our lives.Just get through the initial queue and waiting around and you'll see how great it is.Fantastic. Typical Singapore.

review_425708140,“Well worth a visit.”,"Having previously visited and not enjoyed Universal Studios in Osaka Japan we were rather reluctant to try Universal Singapore. Well how wrong we were…..Learning many lessons from Japan we pre-booked our Universal Express passes and luckily for us they made a massive difference to our enjoyment.Unfortunately our daughter was unwell the day we booked (the Universal Express pass is valid for 1 day only) however we called and asked for the day to be transferred and they happily obliged. Being centrally located we took an uber there from our apartment. There are many rides and attractions to immerse your self into and we did. Our ratbag is 10 and she went on all the rides, including the brilliant Battlestar Galactica Human vs Cylon, which comprises of two different roller coasters that are an absolute must do – we did them both multiple times.Another must is Transformers The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle – it is the ultimate, in fun.And the Lights, Camera, Action, Hosted by Steven Spielberg is waaaay more exciting than the Japan version, so much better…..be prepared, if you’re in the front row on the right hand side, you will get wet…Other rides that provide a thrill a minute are:Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure – you will get wet, but only slightly…Canopy Flyer – short but sweet.Revenge of the Mummy – best ride in the whole entire park, we went 4 times and would go again…Go to all the shows and events as they do not disappoint, at all.There are many differing varieties of food for all tastes and palates that are actually tasty and not the pre-cooked and packaged slop one would expect, for once.We would highly recommend Universal Singapore but only with the Express pass, you will save sooo much time queuing.

review_425466986,“Considerably fun. Worth a visit.”,"adult pricing can range from $55-$74/pax depending on where tickets are bought from. Pretty awesome theme park! Weekdays would definitely be recommended as queues are much shorter on such days. They added new rides from my last visit which was really cute. New rides we're themed from sesame street and puss in boots! Like the idea that lockers near the more exciting rides are available for free for certain periods of time. It also changes as according to the queue time. For example, the iconic red and blue roller coasters. Lockers we're initially free for the first 45mins. But later in the day, they we're free for the first 95 mins. This was pretty awesome for people who go in small groups. Less hassle and you don't need to exclude anyone to simply take care of the bags.

Highly recommend to those who plan to do holiday in Singapore for the next few months. With season pass, we planned to visit and quickly go to the popular rides first when the park has just opened to avoid crowd.

Our favourite rides were Cylon, Human, Transformers and The Mummy. It was a really hot day (just for a change) and the Jurassic Park water ride was great for cooling down. The staff at each of the rides were enthusiastic and very helpful. Given how hot the temperature can get, I think the park would benefit from having some misting stations scattered around to let you cool down. KT's Bar had a happy hour from 1600-1800 with ice cold Tigers at 2 for $19. Excellent service....

review_425283487,“The One and Only in South East Asia”,"Universal Studio provides endless entertainment not only to the Children but the parents as well. To have the best experience, one needs to stay at one of the hotels within Sentosa island and choose one owned and operated by the Resorts World Sentosa (Festive Hotel, Hard Rock Hotel Singapore, Hotel Michael, and Equarius Hotel, Crockfords Tower, Beach Villas, Ocean Suite, TreeTop Loft, and ESPA at Resort Worlds Sentosa). When you are tired at the end of the day, you just need to crawl back to the hotel (of which if you stay outside of Sentosa, the tiredness will be double) and relieve yourself.Please do purchase your tickets online to enjoy a special discount and as a precaution to avoid long queue or to check for the operating date (sometimes public holidays do spoil your dream). And don't forget to purchase an express ticket to enjoy the non-queueing facility that Universal Studio provides. It could be miserably tiring for a long wait just to enjoy a ride. Universal Studio hosts numerous games and entertainment based on its latest movie release. And to the thrill seekers, this centre provides enough roller coasters challenge both indoor and outdoor. I particularly like the digital lockers to leave your belongings during the roller coaster rides.The souvenir shops sell variety of merchandise but please be aware that each of them sells different pattern/products/merchandise depending on the store concept and the entertainment stage next to it. For customisation (such as engraving), you can only do it at the stores located inside of the Universal Studio and none at the store outside of the Studio gate.Sentosa itself hosts lot of other attractions beside Universal Studio. You can enjoy the fish aquarium, dolphin shows, massive waterparks, cable car, beaches, golf course, and not forgetting the CASINO.

The park is issuing too many express pass and the waiting time at cyclone and Galgatta was more than 40 minutes. They did not allow to use the express pass for the canopy flyer when we visited on 03/10/2016.There should be some sort of limitations in selling express pass as they do in Universal studios Osaka.The waiting time is too much for express pass holders which is frustrating and makes the experience at the park worse.

review_425033508,“Full on - Great Day Out!! ”,"An excellent attraction on Sentosa.Plenty to see and do at Universal Studios.Needed the full 8-9 hours to see all the attractions and at least one ride on each of the rides. They offer an express pas at extra cost. We elected to not pay the extra. Friends who had visited recommended it if you're limited for time and want to ride.For waits of up to 2 hours for a 1min and 30 second ride, then it's worth the universal express pass where waiting times could be say anywhere from a couple of minutes to say 10-15minutes.After a while you do get a little frustrated to see pass holder walking via the dedicated lines past the majority to get on a ride.There are various attractions based on the:Battle star GalacticaTransformersJurassic ParkPuss n BootsSesame StreetMadagascar Dragon ExpressShrek So there is plenty on offer!Bring your wallet though. Like all good theme parks, cold drinks and food are relatively expensive.Lockers are available for patrons where gear can be left for those rides where gear cannot be taken. Lockers have some free time before a small rental is charged.Recommended for families with young children say 6 upwards. A little older and they can sort of look after themselves in terms of being able to ride independently.A lot of rides etc photos, etc cannot be taken or at least signposted as such.Full on day out, so charge those battery cells the night before!! Have fun!

But we got there by taxi from the Woodlands (the boarder to Malaysia to Singapore) it was a 25 minute metered drive ($25 SGD). No wait to get tickets ($75 SGD) so we went straight in, very clean and well managed, not too many people there very nice and up kept, we had to wait the max of 30 mins for a ride. There was no line on some rides we got immediately access, like ""The Mummy Returns"" ride and ""Transformers 4D"" ride both very good. The ""Battlestar galactica"" roller coaster ride is very good one of the best, it topped the day for the brave. ""Jurassic park"" water ride also fantastic keep in mind you will get wet if not soaked. In conclusion great day, low crowds.

review_424568327,“Great Fun! Something for everyone!”,"I rode 3 of the ""Thrill-seeker"" rides - Battlestar Galactica, Mummy Returns & Transformers. As well as Shrek 4D experience & Elmo's space adventure.The Battlestar ride was epic! You can choose between two lines, & I chose the Cylon one as it was the scarier of the two. Well worth the experience! There were twists, turns & 360s even! Not for the faint of heart.Mummy returns was pretty thrilling, as the ride is mostly in the dark which adds an element of surprise to a traditional coaster-type experience. Transformers was great too, as its a POV ride where you are a character in the movie. A must for any fan!If your travelling in September - October, would advise to go in the second half of the day to catch the spooky Halloween specials.Overall great options for adults & children alike!

GOOD RANGE OF RIDES FOR SCARDEY CATS & THRILL SEEKERS”,"We had a great day out arriving just before 10am to avoid the entry queues and leaving at closing time (6pm). We booked on line to get the discounted price and to avoid the ticket office queue, and we did go with the Unlimited Express pass.It was Tuesday when we visited, so it wasn't overly busy and yes there were rides that you could walk straight onto or wait just a couple of minutes in the morning. However it was handy to have the Unlimited Express pass towards the end of the day when the kids wanted to have multiple turns on rides such as Cylon, Human, Transformers, Mummy and Jurassic Park (which for me was the best ride ... there's nothing better than a ride where you get a bit wet!!)We went with our 5yo ""scardey cat"", 9yo ""not too scarey rider"" and 11yo ""thrill seeker"" and friends who had 4 children of similar ages. We found that there was a good range of rides/attractions for all members of both families. However if you are an adrenaline junkie without kids and don't like the tame, entertainment rides (such as Its a Small World at Disneyland)you may find that you'll be hard pressed to make it a full day out unless you ride 4-5 rides over and over.The only food option we visited was Mel's Diner which is your classic burger place and prices were comparable to your regular burger place.Re the photo opportunity with your favourite characters, if there's one you really want s pic with make sure you check the schedule as the ""minders"" are very strict with adhering to the set times and you will be turned away ... sadly we missed the cute little minions!!My only minor disappointment that there wasn't the usual parade (only available weekends and public holidays) and fireworks to end the day ... just didn't quite feel right to me just finishing in a ride and walking out!

review_423473749,“Adults Survival Guide to Universal Studios”,"Like me, if you're wondering whether paying for a visit to Universal Studios is worth it when you DON'T have young children, keep reading. If you're interested to get some useful tips then keen reading as well. To give you an idea, my mum and I (two adults, 30s and late 50s visited in September of 2016)1. Is it worth the $65SGD. A resounding yes. More on this discounted price later. 2. Getting there: Make sure you're at the front gate by 10am to enter. We did this and found that the first 2 hours were relatively quiet. 3. Prioritising the rides: Research the rides before you get there. As I mentioned earlier, the first 2 hours are relatively quiet but in saying that you'll still have to queue. The best rides in order are: Transformers, Battestar Gallatica CYLON, The Mummy, Battlestar Jurrasic Park Rapids (you will get wet), Battlestar Gallatica Human. This is just my opinion as an adult. There were others there but they are more geared at children so we didn't go. 4. Do most of the rides BEFORE the afternoon: At 1:30pm there is an unmissable Waterworld Show at Lost Worlds that goes for 30 minutes. This show including its stunt actors were amazing and you should definitely try to get there. 5. FREE lockers: There were free lockers for both Battlestar rides. You MUST have all your stuff in these lockers before the ride otherwise there are lockers just before you get on. These lockers are free for the first hour and so when you place your valuables into these lockers, my advice would be to queue up for the Battlestar CYLON and then Battlestar Human. They are next to one another. 6. NOT FREE lockers: There was another locker bay for your valuables near the Jurrasic Park Rapids. These were NOT free and we found out after that it wasn't compulsory to store you valuables in there before the ride. If you're not afraid that your stuff might get a little damp then just take it on the boat ride with you. There were plenty of bags and backpacks on the boats when we went. The price of the lockers was $4SGD. Not a lot but they should have told us that it wasn't compulsory. 7. Breakfast: Have a big breakfast early but give yourself a couple of hours to digest before going on the rides mentioned above; some people may feel nauseous. 8. Express Pass: Reading previous reviews I know people are divided on these passes. We decided NOT to get them and see how we went. As we attended Universal Studio on a weekday (Thursday) we thought it would be okay and in the end it was. The longest that we had to wait was for the first and definitely most popular Transformers ride (30min wait) but the others varied from 2mins - 25mins. I know this sounds like a lot of waiting around but nearly all these queues were undercover/inside with strong airconditioning so it's definitely doable. Yes, it was a little envious to watch others with Express Passes stroll through without lining up but I enjoyed conversation with my mum while in the queue. Also, it's part of the theme park experience I believe. 9. Food: As previously mentioned, have a big breakfast. This should get you through to 1:00pm at least. Food prices were expensive, but not outrageous compared to other theme parks; $12SGD for a hotdog and $4 for a bottle of Coke just to give you an idea. We didn't buy any food, only drinks but if you do get hungry, bring some snacks. They do check bags before entry but I didn't see anyone take away people's snacks. 10. Photos: Around the park there will be strategically placed life size figurines of characters such as Sesame Street characters, Madagascar characters, Optimus Prime, Minions etc. with photographers placed in front of them. They want you to stand in front so they can take a photo. Depending on how you feel about this, stand in front of the figurines and let the photographer take your photo, however also ask them to take a few shots with your own camera (they will all agree to do this for you). Then go and view the photos that the photographers have take and if you really love the images and would like to buy then go ahead however if not, then you've got some images on your own camera that they have taken for you. The cost for these photos to be purchased is $25SGD, which is the most priciest non value for money item in the park. 11. Photos at the front: When you first arrive at Universal Studios, there will be a VERY STRONG URGE to take a photo in front of the iconic revolving Universal Studios globe. Fight this urge as best as you can and just go into the park to enjoy the day. Before the park opens, there are hordes of people trying to do the exact same thing. What this means is that its almost impossible to get a good picture without someone being in the shot. Wait until after you have left the park to take the photo. When we left at 3:30pm, it was A LOT easier to take a good shot. 12. Hats & sunscreen: Bring a hat, comfortable shoes (preferably sandals and not thongs/flip flops because for the rollercoasters they'll make you take them off as it can fall off) and sunscreen if you're fair skinned. You'll be walking around a lot during the day. I had my Fitbit on during our visit and we walked approximately 12,000 steps. 13. Discount tickets: As mentioned earlier, we didn't pay the $74SGD cost of the park. We stayed at the Wangz Hotel (another review that I'll write) later and they had a Handy phone which allowed guests to purchased discounted rate tickets so we paid $65 plus there was another $2 discount so all up it was $63 per person and based on what we experienced, it was definitely worth it. 14. Have a good attitude: You're at a theme park in SE Asia. It will be hot, there will be foreign people speaking different languages, there will be kids and queues. I think if you go in with these expectations then you'll have a realistic and good time. On the upside, the staff are efficient and polite, there were clean restrooms within a few steps of each other, the park was stroller friendly and the atmosphere was upbeat and lively. 15. Water: If you're really on a budget and don't want to spend any money on food or drinks then make sure that you at least have an empty water bottle. It gets really hot so you'll need water to stay hydrated and there are plenty of water refill stations around as well. Overall, if you've read up to now; it should be clear that my opinion is to definitely go. We entered to park at 10:00am and left by 3:30pm having thoroughly enjoyed ourselves as two adults. I think that even if you've got children, spending close to 6hrs here is enough as it ensures that even children don't become overly tired. Hopefully the tips above have been useful. So, take that trip back to your childhood and enjoy the experience!

review_423444642,“Absolutely top class!”,"We visited the universal studios singapore at the end of the last month & had a great day. There are seven movie-themed zones, and each is uniquely designed. Since we were visiting the park along with my 4 yr old son we ensured that we did all the child friendly attractions. This theme park is suitable for all ages. Only make sure that if you are travelling with toddlers get a stroller along for the child to sit in as there is a lot of walking to do. You need to leave the strollers outside the rides at designated stroller areas. All rides have height restrictions for children & make sure to check them before standing in the queue.My son enjoyed the Madagascar ride, Jurassic Park rapids, spaghetti Chase & Shrek castle the most.The transformers ride & Jurassic Rapids have the longest waiting times (45- 75mins). It is advisable to purchase the express tickets as this will save a lot time. The entry to park starts at 10 am & most visitors head straight to the transformers ride which is located close to the entrance, so it is a good idea to do the other rides first & visit this later as it is less crowded during the late afternoon.Make sure to schedule an entire day at Universal studios.

review_423428056,“Great day out”,"We had a fabulous day at Universal Studios. Glad we didn't buy a front of line pass as the longest we had to wait was 5 minutes. All of the staff on the rides were great and the people escorting the characters were only too happy to take our photos.A tip if you want character photos is to watch the little shows they put on in the streets as they allow you to have your photo taken with the characters at the end of the show. This worked well as we were after specific characters eg the Cookie Monster.We got our tickets from a travel agent in China Town for $60 which was a huge saving. We went without kids and it was fantastic.

review_423368668,“Must visit!”,"USS is a must visit if you are in Singapore even on a short trip only, allocate an entire day since you could spend ages waiting in line for your turn in the rides. And I should mention that USS is all about rides. Rides and rides and sorts of it. If you are a person who isnt fond or hate those kind of stuff (like my companion) then I suggest to better spend your bucks somewhere else.You might want to take advantage of promos you can avail online, as well as discounts from hotels and other travel agencies.Bring a water bottle so that you can just have it refilled at the drinking fountains.

review_423097216,“Singapore is really incomplete without Universal Studios”,"It is one of the best place to spend your money. I got my ticket from an agent in the China Town @S$60 and after that express unlimeted pass @S$50. The express pass it's really worth it. I hardly had to stand for 3 mins for a ride. But felt very bad for the normal riders because the crew members are giving priority to the express pass holders much like if they are allowing 4 express holders then against that they are leaving only for 1 normal pass holders. It looked a bit weird to me. And the persons who had not availed their express pass had to stand atleast 30 mins. The sci-fic city has really got a bunch of stuffs like the transformers, cyclone and all. The water park, mummy are also good. But I will suggest to everyone who is opting for express pass to start with Madagascar and far fairy land because the rides in sci-fic city will give u a lot of enjoyment cum it will rip all of your energy. I felt like vomiting when I got off from the cyclone. and I actually ruined my next rides pretty much. Hope to visit again if I come to Singapore next year.

Waterworld was closed.The lines were about 40 min to 2 hour wait from 10am - 3pm. So i recommend buying express ticket for $30 on top of $74 ticket and just heading to the front. Saved so much time and was worth it. You pretty much straight on. You can only use it once on each ride but between 4-6pm there is hardly much time to wait.Otherwise it was a bit boring with all the gimmick shops. I liked the sound effects show to.

There are also many many other rides. You only need to be patient in the queue.See characters from various cartoons come alive.

review_422589680,“Better than expected!”,"Although I'd already purchased a Senior's pass, I didn't know then, that my TA had sorted a stopover pass in Singapore that included free admission! That meant that I went twice.Of course it isn't as large as Florida or LA, but way, way cheaper and good value. On our first visit, 6 years ago, we walked out before riding anything due to torrential rain - but Singapore's weather can change in an instant, so be prepared.This time, it was a solo visit and often, being a single rider has advantages. On the transformer ride, I waited over an hour in the single rider's queue, as they only use singles to fill in a vacant seat in the 12 seater 'pods'. The staff running this ride need to be aware and realise that maybe putting 12 singles on a pod every now and again would have a huge impact on the queue, which I suspect was much longer time-wise than the general queue.The entertainment guys doing the break dancing in the covered street had the volume up so high that it hurt the ears and was totally unnecessary.Unlike most theme park food outlets, I found the curry on sale opposite the Mummy ride to be fantastic value and extremely tasty, so much so that I ate there both days!There are one or two rides here that you won't find in LA so the parks are different. The Shrek 4D movie is always a pleasant experience and a chance to sit down.What did surprise me however was that immediately outside the park gate is a 'food street' where an authentic main dish was under $10.Well worth a visit and a senior pass at $36, brilliant value. Although many seniors may be with grandchildren, some do ride! Pity Disney and Universal in LA don't offer a discount.

review_422474977,“Really great but only if you purchase an express pass”,"Ok so like us, you have made up your mind to take the younger children (we took a 9 yr old and a 7 yr old) to Universal studios to check out the latest and greatest.The good - incredible rides, wonderful settings The bad - the heat - ok it's singapore right and you knew it would be 32+ in the shade - tip, like the locals, get a small umbrella - it's wonderfulThe ugly - entrance price is ok but the queues are enormous, we came on a Monday and non school holidays and the cool rides are 1+ hour wait and 3 hours is not uncommon in the busiest. You have to purchase an express pass to skip straight to the queue - don't hesitate, just budget it in if you really want to enjoy the day. Just imagine waiting 90 mins in the heat with screaming kids - you get the picture.....Best rides for 9 year old+ - both the battle star galactica roller coaster scared the day lights out of me and the transformer 3D ride was amazingOur 7 year old loved the shrek4D adventure and the less scary rides. Both of them loved the Jurassic park ride and of course the minions from Despicable MeHave fun visiting!

review_422469408,“You are sure to return one day”,"Recommend an early breakfast in your Singapore downtown hotel and getting to Universal studios on opening at 10am. Getting there is optional by the Mount Faber cable car, Sentosa express or bus/car. Plan on a good 7-8 hour day. A whole day at Universal is needed to get maximum benefit. We like the 2 day fun pass Sentosa Island attractions on Day 1 and Universal Studios on Day 2. There is plenty to enjoy and we tried most things. Queuing time was short and averaged 5 to 15 mins for the main attractions like the roller coaster rides. Everything is well done and suitable for all the family.

Wait times were anywhere from 15 to 50 minutes pending if the ride is a major attraction or not. Kids will love it. So much to see and keep them entertained. You might struggle with younger children due to the heat and just the pure excitement of it all for them. It's expensive, but the same any where in the world for such a tourist trap right!!!!!

Entrance ticket is 74 SGD which allows all rides for free, however there are 2 lines for general and others for priority which will take less time for a ride especially when you see the long lines in general. There is an additional ticket if you pay another SGD 75 you will be allowed for priority with unlimited access per individual. Best time to go there is first thing in the morning, inside food is expensive but affordable. You will plenty of shops to buy some stuff for kids and the price range starts from 15 SGD and reasonably it may go above 35 SGD for general bags and toys etc. For this attraction you may spent more than 6 hours so it is a day tour to plan. if you are traveller then suggest going on working days to avoid weekend visitors.

review_422375472,“Good fun - and a manageable size”,"Spent a day here with the kids at the end of our Summer holidays. We decided to visit on a Monday after reading about the queues, and hoped that it wouldn't be too bad. In fact, we arrived before opening and it was quiet for the first hour or so, which enabled us to get a few of the 'bigger' rides in. However, bear in mind that the Jurassic Park area doesn't open until later...Good rides and the queues did build up during the morning to the point that we bought an express pass. This we quite expensive (more than the price of admission, but for a one-off visit we bit the bullet. On balance, we probably did the right thing, although the queues did vary a lot from ride to ride, and the time estimates were sometimes wildly inaccurate - stating 50 mins wait outside when only a 10-minute wait in reality.Otherwise, a very good day out and we managed to go on all of the rides - most of them 2 or 3 times, especially as it got much quieter during the late afternoon.Food selections were good - and prices as you would expect for a theme park. We missed most of the shows, as our teenage kids preferred the rides, but there did seem to be a lot going on - so a full day needed probably for most people.

Our guide, Halik, was incredibly engaging, efficient and appropriately generous with his advice on what we would enjoy and why. He was always spot on. Our 3 young kids loved him and loved the park. Even though the park was fairly quiet our ability to go straight to the front of the line allowed us to cover all attractions over a 6 hour period. I don't think we would have got everything in even with an express pass. The one on one photo ops with the characters made the kids day.

I enjoyed eating at the diner and watching the brilliant fireworks display at the end of the evening. A real must is the Transformers ride, although our daughter didn't enjoy it at all!

We pre purchased our tickets and got them at a good price (not directly with resort world) We got the unlimited fast pass once we got inside park an it was worth every cent as it was a very hot day and the lines were long! My youngest daughter was able to go on all the rides at age 7. We spend 7 hours there, so my advice is wear comfortable shoes that you don't mind getting wet. This is a must do in Singapore!

The staff are wonderful and want you to have a great time.It appears as though the busiest ride is the rapids ride in jurrassic park. It opens later at 11. I would be there at 11 unless you have an express pass.The meals werent as expensive as i thought. $10 for a plain hotdog chips and drink ( kids meal) Both battlestar galactica rides are popular so do them early too. Transformers ride was not that busy today. It is the best ride. The mummy ride was good. We had an awesome day. Need to do air conditioned things in the middle of the day . It gets hot at the waterworld show, you get most wet in the middle section and to the left. This is a good time to visit .

Reaching the studio is easy but a little crowded and queues might take your time, better to take a shuttle to reach Sentosa island instead of metro/train.The must experience rides other than the big roller coaster is - Transformers, The Mummy (A must must must go ride) and Jurassic park. The Jurassic park ride has a very long queue so you need to plan accordingly. There are lot of other things which both kids and adults can enjoy. Shrek 4D show is also entertaining and keeps your mood light and happy. If you are planning to visit Singapore, do keep universal studios on top of your Things to do list

The Sentosa express train needs to be purchased seperately from the main train system at $4 return. $74 entrance and arrived at 10am opening time. We went on almost every ride being in our 20's we enjoyed nearly all of them. Obviously some are more child friendly which is gread for family's. The park is so clean and tidy much like Singapore itself. We went on the transformer ride 3 times which was a thriller. The mummy rollercoaster was also a must for the thrillseekers.

review_420690994,“For kids of all ages”,"We pre-purchased our tickets from the Chintatown Visitors Centre as it was cheaper. We paid S$68 each adult for admission. On arrival you have options to upgrade - you can pay an extra $50 per adult for an Express Pass - which allows you to jump to the front of the queue ONCE for each ride or pay $70 per adult for an Unlimited Express Pass - which allows you to jump to the front of the queue ALL the time. We opted for the Express Pass which was perfect for our needs.We arrived early (10am opening) and headed in the opposite direction to the crowds. We didn't use our Express Pass on the first few rides as the queues were not bad at all! As the day wore on, the lines got longer, although we must have been in a quiet time as they were never more than 30 minutes. So we used our pass in the afternoon.It is rather compact but they amazingly fit so many themed areas and rides. We stayed until closing (6pm in the quiet time). I don't do the big scary rides but my husband did and was more than thrilled. I loved all the theme rides and had a great time too. Many options for food and drink.Of course it is not as huge as the American Universal Studios but well worth the visit, in a great location and combined with so many other things to do in the area.

Park is so well organised. It was a pleasure to visit. Good amount of shade, water fountains, clean toilets. Staff were so friendly, and helpful.We had an amazing lunch at Kt Grill. My son has food allergies, and staff fully understood what I was requesting for him. My sons steak was the best meal we have had on our trip so far. He wants to go back just for another lunch!The Transformer is a MUST!!! The most amazing ride I've ever been on. All the roller boasters though are not to be missed.A lot of lockers are free for 45mins, which was fantastic. As our family of 4 went on all rides together, and the lockers were a huge help in allowing us to do this.Street shows were also very cool. The American dance group were great to watch,Fiends had advised us to buy the jump the queue pass - fortunately today it just wasn't needed.Great day, and strongly recommend for all ages.Universal Studios weren't here on our last visit to Singapore - so glad it's here now, a great addition to the beautiful Sentosa Island.

We managed to meet with almost all the characters and take all the fun rides. Lockers are free and compulsory for some rides. They start to charge after designated time but if you plan strategically like we did you manage to use them within time limit.

Also, whoever does the voice of Donkey in the live comedy show is spot-on and awesome! The thing I least liked? I really didn't like lining up for those rides that required the use of fingerprint based storage lockers; hope they changed that in the future.We came into Universal Studio at noon on Friday with an unlimited Express Pass and was able to get on most of the attractions available before 6 PM. Unfortunately, there were glitches on few of the attractions, so that caused us to miss out on a few. Express Pass definitely seemed worth it, as we only waited at most 5 to 10 minutes per attraction, where the standard line could range from 20 to 100+ minutes.

We immediately joined the 45 min queue for Cylon roller coaster, and not long afterwards the waiting time leapt to 90 min for people behind us. The roller coaster ride was epic! The park got so busy it was unpleasant. We really recommend the Express tickets to reduce waiting time by half. We also found the displayed waiting times were hugely inaccurate and underestimated the wait time significantly - not something we expected in Singapore. The heat and humidity were absolute killers and with all the crowds I advise you think carefully before taking little kids. I am sure it would be better on off-off-peak times.

If you're not a fan of rides, there are other things to do in USS like watch the shows with their timetable which you can found on the rack of map and if not, you can roam around and just be like a kid who always like to go to such amusement to be amaze. If you get hungry? No worries, there are food stall in there, foodcourt and a bistro. There are souvenir shops too in each ride which you can just enter anytime without queue.

review_419759058,"“Limited attractions, very long queues...”","Having been to the Universal Studios in Florida, my family went to the one in Singapore in August 2016 with reservations.We booked our visit through one of the agents in Singapore. We were fetch from our hotel but since we were not just their customer, the bus went around a few hotels to fetch other customers. And then we were dropped at the Gardens by the Bay and were made to endure another 30minute wait for another coach to get us to Universal Studios.Universal Studios in Singapore is small and was quite busy throughout the day. We bought express pass (which doubled what we have paid) to avoid the queue but the pass is not for all attractions. So in some of the attractions, we still have to bear the very long queue in searing tropical heat.Being a small place, as expected, there are fewer attractions. And fewer attractions meant longer queues. To be fair, big fans were provided at the queue to cool you off. Still you need lots of water not to get dehydrated.At the end of the day, we have to look for our own transport as it's not part of the packaged tour. So we took a private van to take us back to the hotel for a flat rate of $50. Of course there is another option, a public bus or cab with very long queue.In summary, our experience was not that great I must say, compared to the one in Florida. You need to spend the whole day to try all the attractions. However, it's still not a guarantee that you would be able to get into all of them... because of long queues. I would recommend that you book your tickets online rather than going through an agent. Get a cab or a private van to the resort and back to avoid wasting your time. And most of all, bring lots of money to spend especially if you have got children.

You should go not too early because you don't want to miss out the live shows. It may get very hot, so drink fluids and get your hats n sunglasses.

We decided to buy express pass for additional 50$/head (no choice with theese waiting times.). With express pass the waitig time is ok (20min ipo 100min at main attractions). The attractions themselves are great. Kids still talked about it for a week. Need to plan 3-4hrs minimum. Overall verry nice but expensive stay.

review_419391821,“Small but perfectly formed”,"Alot smaller that we were expecting but it was a good way to spend a few hours. We pre-purchased Express Unlimited tickets and got there at opening time. Was really quiet and had no wait getting in or on any of the rides. First stop was Transformers 3D which was totally fab. We ended up going on 4 times throughout the day. Totally spoilt the rest of the rides though which couldn't compete. Jurassic Park rapids was OK but a bit dated - and wet !. The Mummy was the same - a bit dated and not particularly exciting. Battlestar Gallatica is a non-starter if you are even a slightly larger person. Luckily didn't wait in line due to having express pass but when the overhead seat lock didn't fit it was embarrassing - more than 1 person had to leave the ride. Why they don't mention this before climbing up to the ride I do not know. Would be gutting if you had to queue for ages then couldn't get on. I imagine the ones in the USA are built for the bigger person. The Waterworld show was good fun and alot of energy by the performers. Only on twice on the Saturday we went so be sure to check the show timings. Lights, Camera, Action was interesting to see how the films create a hurricane on a stage set. Can't comment on the kids rides. Overall USS is worth a visit and worth buying an express ticket as it got much busier as the day went on.

review_419020234,“Fun Day Out For Everyone”,"Really enjoyed the day, weekdays are the best to go, Still really busy but bare able. Qs were about 15mim-1 hour long. If you can splash for an express i'd recommend it, Q for the pass were about 10-25 minutes on all rides. Transformers, The Mummy and Jurassic park rappids are a must. Don't understand the locker system think its ridiculous, some rides you can take your bag some you cant, then you have to pay for a locker, but you don't know how long you need for one ride! It seems a bit of a money making scheme when its pricey to enter already. And more Qs. If you have small children i would definitely make sure you measure them before you Q, evey ride there was a family that got turned away for children being to small, you can measure them at the entrance, this will save you time and a lot of disappointment!

review_418679686,“Much nicer for younger kids than the California one”,"We have been to the one in LA a few times but this one is so much nicer for younger kids, we have a 6 yr old and he had a blast. Still lots of coasters for the teens and adults, just nice to have so much more for the younger kids. Lots More. Super clean, super nice staff, the wait times posted were absolutely accurate and amazed at all the cover available for any intense sun or unexpected rain. Its rare I would still say something could be enjoyed if it rained but this is the exception IF you are taking younger to elementary age kids, the coasters would probably shut down, but that would still leave Transformers and Mummy if it was just a passing shower. We had flawless weather but I still enjoyed all the shade covering, and it was not as Loud as ours here in California. I truly wish we could copy theirs. The Water World show is outstanding. Just a great day and even better- a great price. Easily reached at the end of the Sentosa walkway or take the SWR8 bus (only $1) from in front of the Vivo mall and take the escalator up near the McDonalds and you will be close. If you are there when it opens, lines are almost non-existent, most head to the biggest events- like Transformers, we barely waited 10 minutes.

review_418669172,“Worth visit but need proper planning”,"Worth visit. Many many rides and shows are there. If you want to do all in a single day, it is nearly impossible because of long queue everywhere. Please collect the map first and choose what to do and what not. For families with kids and aged person, please do not head for big roller coasters like me. The staffs are very helpful and polite in behavior. From my experience, excluding two big roller coaster the rating from the best is as follows: body of works show (3.30 pm) > madagascar > lost world (rafting), canopy nothing special > Hollywood (special effects show). A lot more are there, but these are the best. Advice 1: Small baby (below 92 cm or in some cases below 122 cm) are not allowed in any ride. Family person should not visit Universal studio until your baby reaches a certain height. I have gone through their website. But this is not mentioned anywhere. Or if mentioned then also NOT very easily noticeable. Many families I have seen just sitting inside with either of parents. My friend had two kids, one could go for rides and the other was small who could not. So either my friend or his wife had to sacrifice some rides. The website should clearly mention this thing.Advice 2: Bring foods/drinks/mineral water with you. Everything is very very expansive inside the park.Advice 3: Be prepared for long long queue at most of the good rides.

And till now I love to come here with my friends, family or even alone. Coming from one attraction to another: Madagaskar, Shreck, Mummy, Jurassic Park, Transformers, movies of Steven Spielberg, Sesam Street - gives you a feeling of being a part of a fairy tale! A lot of cafes and souvenir shops bring you very festive feelings! Depending on your preferences, you can choose different rides, from the most mild ones as Madagaskar, Sesame Street and Jurassic Park to the most scary ones as Mummy Ride and Battlestar Galactica - the highest dueling roller coaster in the world. It's very crowded during the weekend and public holidays, so better to come during the weekday or later in the day when the most crowd is gone. During weekend and special dates the Park usually have a Hollywood Parade - it's a very nice carnival of the park characters, try to catch it! And in the evening before the closure is the Firework, similar to the one you see in Disney Cartoons. Check the schedule of the shows on RWS website! Nice place, definitely must go on Singapore!

Gorgeous tea with sandwiches, homemade scones and beautiful little cakes and no rush to finish. Also beautifully flavoured teas. Very reasonably priced too. So you can go to universal studios and also book an afternoon tea , makes for a great day.

review_418278917,“Did the job....”,"Took the kids, again.... Usual thing. Expensive, tacky etc but the kids love it. It is not as busy as the US theme parks and a lot smaller. I always think the US parks 'work' somehow because of the vibe, the regular parades, music and dance shows etc which are always of high quality. To be fair a couple of singing groups came out to entertain the crowds. I guess the demographic is just different. I felt quite sorry for the groups which sang their hearts out to a small crowd of confused looking tourists! Rides are good of course. Realistically battle star galactica and the mummy ride (possibly transformers) are the only ones which are really high octane. My personal strategy is to buy the express ticket which which allows one queue jump per ride. This gets you to the front of the queue at the main gate. Get there around 9:30-9:45. Go straight to battle star galactica, mummy and transformers. Note the blue battle star galactica run is much more aggressive than the red one but they we counted as separate rides. Do as many as these as you can without using your express ticket. Wonder off and do some lighter weight things - maybe take in the waterworld show etc. come back when the queues are around an hour and go straight to the front of the queue. You can then legitimately tell the kids that they can't do the ride again...

review_418253463,“Fun day out though crowded”,"Brought two kids of 3 and 7 to Universal Studios Singapore on the first day of the week long school holidays. Park was pretty crowded with the peak probably at about noon to two. From rope-up time at 10AM, the more junior rides on the left hand side past Hollywood Boulevard did not require too much waiting. Close to noon most rides required 30 minutes of waiting or more. The Waterworld Show was fabulous with lots of crowd engagement (performers pranked audience volunteers even!) before the show started, though younger kids might be a little startled or scared from the pyrotechnics. The New York: Sesame Street: When I Grow Up show is also worth attending if your kids love the characters from it. In all, plan for at least 5 hours to walk through the park and also cover maybe half of the rides without long queues. You'd need a much longer visit if you want to try the popular roller-coaster rides too. Funnily, friends who went to the same park the following day of that week (a Tuesday) observed much shorter queues.

review_417874814,“Great Family Day out but check the Fast Pass small print”,"As per all Universal Studios, this is a great day out for all of the family, however, best enjoyed away from peak holiday periods and weekends. Buying a Fast Track ticket is the best option for all of the family but makes the cost of the day double than a standard entry. Once inside, you also find that fast track is not relevant for all rides and even on some of the more popular rides waiting time can be in excess of 40 minutes on a weekday. It is a great experience and for the kids there are a number of very good rides that they will want to go on repeatedly e.g. Sesame Space Ride where my kids went on 10 times in a row through fast track.There are plenty of places to eat and drink as well as the numerous outlets to buy merchandise which can make this a costly day out if you have kids who want to buy whatever they see.

review_417801210,“Interesting outing especially for children”,"At the very outset, let me say that if you have seen the Universal Studios in Los Angeles (LA), the Singapore one may be a bit of a disappointment in terms of the shows and exhibits.We were a group of eight senior citizens and had planned only for about 6 hours.Unfortunately, at the first show (The Transformers), we had to wait in a snail paced queue for an hour and and a half for a ten minute show which in itself was exceedingly interesting with plenty of simulated action which felt extremely real. A negative feedback is that there is no sitting arrangements whatsoever for senior citizens during this entire 90 minute long queue in which we must have moved about 600-700 metres.Another interesting ride (this time real) was at the Jurassic Park where we floated down a narrow water body complete with rapids, etc., and concluding with a sudden unexpected heart stopping vertical drop. At some of the bends of the water body, there were life sized replicas of the various inhabitants of the Jurassic Park with real sounding roars. Yes, all, especially children will love it. (similar to the one in LA which I felt was better).The Water World was yet another interesting show which will be loved by children - complete with speed boats, shooting, action in the water, etc. Again, a copy of the show in LA.You need two days if you want to experience all the shows including the roller coasters.Go for it.

review_417764367,“Only a few rides worth going for!”,"This theme park is quite small as compared to others around the world considering how small Singapore is. There are rides for Madagascar, Shrek, Jurassic Park, The Mummy, Battlestar Galatica and Transformers. The best rides would be Cylon on Battlestar, followed by Human on Battlestar then Mummy. Mummy is thrilling cause you hit a wall at one point and you move backwards but the ride itself is very very short and in pitch darkness so you dont see anything. The Universal Express pass cannot be used for Jurassic Park's Canopy Flyover and I find this extremely annoying. Guests buy the Express Pass to cut down on waiting time but it seems like you can't do it for Canopdy Flyover when the waiting time is usually more than 45mins. Also, we noticed that Express Passes and Unlimited Express Passes were sold everywhere around the park. That explains why we had to wait 3 rounds for Battlestar despite being on the Express Pass. In the end, those without the Express Pass made it earlier than we did. What a bummer! Waterworld is just an act which has two shows per day so catch them (last one is 330pm) before it closes. Given that we can't use Express pass on one ride and that people without Express passes could be even faster than we were, I highly doubt the purpose of buying them. Even if you do need it, you could get them easily around the park without having to buy online. That way you can assess the situation and decide if you want to spend that extra bit.

But you can have more experience for it. If you have hart problems I personally advice do not travel in roller corset. However if you can please get that experience.

review_417080318,"“Overated, over-priced way to seek thrills”","Concept for some rides have not changed from 30 years ago- you sit in a boat/vehicle which brings you along a canal/track to see mechanised tired rubberized/plasticized and stiff replicas of movie/animal characters with soundtracks and spotlights that turn on and off as programmed.A camera takes pictures of your group and you are encouraged to fork out exorbitant amounts of money for that momento. Ok to visit if you have never been to theme parks elsewhere, and you seek the thrill of roller coasters. For those with young children and middle age to elderly folks- better off giving this park a miss.

Some changes over the years and we missed the Monster Rock show and the galetical ride was shut down due to technical error and safety concerns over the years. It was an average sized park with sufficient fun for the young ones. Food and especially drinks are expensive in the park especially when you have a family.

We had a great day and enjoyed all the attractions we went on in each of the seven zones the park is split into. The park offers free wifi, but to get it you need access to e-mail to verify and connect, so you need to use roaming data to do this. We didn't bother. Also, I would recommend you pre buy your entrance tickets as I queued for an hour just for the tickets. All in all a great day out!

I recommend buying the express pass as the queues are extremely long and it is a bore to stand with whining children. Maps are really informative and the gift shops sell a large variety of souvenirs for everyone. After every ride, you get to buy a photo if they took one while you were riding. Dining was pretty good with a variety of restaurants and stands to buy from. Many shows around the whole park and well-known characters walk around the park for you to take pictures with.

The rides are fun, some actually quite frightening and the Express Pass is basically a pass to help you cut the waiting queue, which is very convenient, especially for some of the more fun rides. The various restaurants and cafes serve quality food and they haven't different types of items available at each one. The rides are also enjoyable for all ages; there are ones for younger kids and others for the more thrill-seeking daredevils. The experience was worth-it and I highly recommend it!

review_416053044,“A full day of fun for everyone”,"This is the second time I visited Universal Studios Singapore (USS). The last time was last year and both times with my family including our toddlers. Before entering the park, it's a must to take a photograph at the iconic globe just outside the entrance. Do note that it can be quite crowded at times so do find a good spot so as to minimise photo bombs. Entering the park is a breeze as there is an entrance for families with young children. For those that did not bring their prams, you can rent one from the customer service inside the park at a fee and it can accommodate 2 kids easily. Raincovers can also be rented. Those visiting in their birthday month with the RWS membership card can also redeem a birthday gift.The park itself is of reasonable size, probably comparable to that of HK Disney land. Do take a map to study the meet the characters timing if your intention is to take photos with your favourite characters. Note that some rides have minimum height. So those below 90cm (if I remember correctly) may have limited choices. Food outlets can be found at every theme corner and they serve different cuisines. It's good to look around as the souvenirs also varies from restaurant to restaurant. Every set meal is about $15 including a drink.Overall it's a good place for a full day of family fun so it's good to go early so as to allocate sufficient time to queue up for the rides. Weekdays are recommended to avoid the crowd which may dampen the experience.

It's the feeling that just for a minute when you're being swept along in the experience of it all and the movies really have come alive and just for a minute they are real!

review_415544787,“Express Ticket Scam erodes Visitor Experience!”,"I really like amusement parks, particularly Roller Coasters and Theme rides. What I don't appreciate is the priority Express passes that give wealthier patrons a way to bypass lines delaying indefinitely those who wait in the ""slow lane!""The extra cost for a limited Express pass is $30. The extra cost for an unlimited Express pass is $50. This is on top of the General Admission cost of $74. I witnessed the staff seating patrons exclusively from the Express line whenever there was somebody in that line. That meant that the regular line didn't seat anyone for about an hour leading up to a severe weather delay. We only got on the Roller Coaster because there was no one in the Express line when the weather cleared. This tiered approach is nothing more than price gouging. The park is well designed and has something for all ages. For our group we enjoyed Revenge of the Mummies (Best ride with no computer 3D graphics), Jurrassic Park Rapids boat ride, and Transformers. Transformers relied on too much 3D projection and not enough on hard design assets and unfortunately represents a lower quality investment by Universal that cheapens the ride into just a rocking theatre experience as opposed to a real amusement ride.Disney does all of this way better than Universal Studios!For Singapore this is a worthy excursion and a real treat in Asia.

Paying the extra for the fast pass will ensure you don't have to wait for long and get to do all the rides in one day. Wait times when busy can be in excess of 60 mins on the rides. It is also good to take a cheap rain poncho for the Jurassic park water ride as they charge $4 each You can get very very wet.

Although on-line ticket price is SGD 74/- we found a travel agent at the basement of the China Town MRT station who gave us a last-minute best rate of SGD 66 for adult ticket & SGD 50 a child ticket.

As its hot and humid, it does help that the eateries in USS are air-conditioned. However, the prices of the food are on the high side even though the taste was average. For instance a coke cost SGD3.50/-. There are also plenty of shaded areas for visitors to take a break.Noted that it was not as crowded as the previous time we went more than 1-2 years back. Nonetheless, min. waiting time for the more popular rides (Transformers, Minion, Puss, etc) still takes at least 45-60 mins. So, if you want to try all the rides and enjoy the shows, its better to go express lane and plan well.I've visited Universal Studios Osako in 2006 and Orlando in 2013, the one in Orlando is the best as its big and has more rides.Nevertheless, USS is the best there is in Asean and is a good theme to keep the whole family (young and old) entertained.Lastly, for those who are into Pokemon, there are also lots to catch in USS.

review_414267884,“Must Visit”,"We had great time at Universal Studios. It required an entire day to cover all major rides of Universal. We were with our 2 year old kid who cannot go to most of the rides. One of us had to be with him all the time. This proved to be a blessing in disguise for us as there is a ""Single rider"" row is all of these rides. Universal is a very very crowded attraction and sometimes it could take 60-80 minutes for you to enjoy one ride. With single rider row we finished almost all major rides in no-time. The only rides which took the maximum time were Roller Coasters in Scifi. We liked the Transformers and Mummy ride to be the best. Transformers ride is a truly genius and its an amazing experience. Because of Halloween preparations the studious were getting closed an hour earlier than the normal time which we felt is unfair to the visitors. We had planned our day as per 8 PM closure and no-where they have informed that it will be a 7PM closure. So it should be taken care.

review_413945891,“Lovely Getaway”,"Buy the One-Day Pass at Universal Studio online. Ours was included in our package.Go for Single Rider, fast and convenient express Lane without extra cost.Bags can be carried on most of the rides except the roller coasters. You can leave your belongings in lockers, conveniently located near the roller coaster attractions and that will be free of charge for the first 30 mins. You can open the locker and then again immediately take another locker for another half an hour which is okay. The rides, especially Transformers, Battlestar and Revenge of the Mummy are quite close by, so you can leave your things there without worrying about the time limit and hop from ride to ride if there are no queues. Toilets are wonderfully clean and always filled with soap and tissue paper to wipe your hands.There are also plenty of drinking water fountains located throughout the park, especially in the waiting areas of each attraction, so it's not necessary to bring your own water or spend a lot of money to stay hydrated. Very thoughtful. • Immerse Yourself in Seven Zoneso Hollywoodo New Yorko Sci-Fi City™o Ancient Egypto The Lost World™o Far Far Awayo Madagascar2-New YorkLights, Camera, Action! Hosted by Steven Spielberg - It’s only 10mins, so do hop on by.3-Sci-fi CityBattlestar Galactica: Cylon - the most awesome ride in the whole theme park, sit in the front, on the sides. (Each row sits 4.). This ride launches you straight into the fast speeds and turbulent turns. Although you may want to keep your glasses in the locker because they may fall off during some of the fast swoops and turns. Cylon is more traumatic, human is somewhat smoother than Cylon. Try once in both. Cylon is blue track, the red one is human.Transformers The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle – You can bring your stuff with you; just put it on the floor of the car beside you on the seat. Each car thingy has three rows, 4-Ancient EgyptRevenge of the Mummy - sit in front. Once again you aren’t allowed to bring your bags with you, because it can get quite jerky oh it suddenly just goes down on the roller coaster. 5-Lost WorldWaterWorld - I would recommend sitting in the middle sections because you’d have an unblocked view. If you don’t want to get wet, sit in the seats above the railings in the middle of the rows. Beware of seating too close to the front section, you are very likely to be wet. There are three well marked zones in the seating area. The blue ones closest to the stage are the soak zone, the green ones away from the stage are the spray zone, and the red ones further away are the dry zone. So if you are sitting in the blue seats, be prepared to be soaked mercilessly.Jurrasic Park - Do be warned that if you sit at the sides you’ll get drenched. Other than that, sit back and relax.Canopy Flyer - It gives you a bird’s eye view of The Lost World and can be a little scary especially if you’re afraid of heights and you sit in the seat that faces backwards . There are some dips and turns, but still smooth and enjoyable overall.6-Far Far AwayShrek 4-D Adventure – Must try. I noticed that you get sprayed a lot. And the seats jerk pretty roughly at some point of time. The intro-movie that they do is pretty long, so stay patient! But the ride itself is exciting.7-MadagascarMadagascar: A Crate Adventure – It’s a slow boat ride through well-made sets Monster Rock – Could not tryEnchanted Airways - Could not try==============================================================Here are some tips for making your visit more enjoyable to Universal Studios, Singapore.• Choose the weekdays without public holiday, if possible, as the weekend would be more crowded.• Wear comfortable attire i.e. shorts and t-shirt. Wear sandals or flip-flop. Avoid jeans, jacket, and shoes.• Reach there as early as possible. It opens at 10 am. Ask for free shuttle service from your hotel.• The first thing you should do is take the USS map and card with various entertainment timings with you.• You can always plan your day according to your preferences and queue timings. You should ask the queue time before entering to attraction, so you can utilize your time more efficiently.HOPE THIS INFO WILL HELP YOU TO PLAN YOUR NEXT VISIT.

We had a good day out and there are quite a few rides for adults.We went with our 10 month old, although there's not much to do for little kids but you can still walk around and see the different sections of the park. Luckily we were 4 adults so we took turns to go on the rides.The park is divide into different areasStarting with Hollywood, then New York, then Scifi City, Ancient Egypt, Jurassic Park, Far Far Away and the last part was Madagascar. The park gets very busy so I would recommend a Universal express pass as its a lot quicker, we wouldn't have been able to go on all the rides if we went through the normal queues as they were more than 2 hours long. The park is great and characters have shows and meet ups at different times so it's best to check that from info centre near the entrance. The parade only happens on weekends so we could t see that but otherwise there were a lot of characters and photo opportunities. We had a great day out and our son really enjoyed the park too. The only downside is that the souvenir and Universal shop is quite expensive and also the food inside is not very cheap.

review_413875479,“Fun day!!”,"Travelled to Singapore with 7 family members aged 25-61. Only 3 of us fancied Universal so I went with my partner (we're both 25) and my brother (28). We all had such a fun day!I've been to Universal Orlando and Universal LA and yes this park is a lot smaller but actually I liked the fact it was compact. We arrived before the gates opened and therefore managed to get on 5 rides without queuing in the first hour. We did have to queue for about an hour for the rapids but it was a fun ride and we then went on again single rider. Be prepared to get very wet though! I chickened out of the Battlestar Galactica rollercoasters so wondered round on my own whilst the boys went on them, they spent just under 2 hours queuing and going on both which wasn't bad when just one of the rides was saying wait time 90 minutes. Some of the rides felt very short but they were still fun. There isn't loads to do compared to some theme parks but certainly enough to fill a day. We were there from before 10am to after closing at 6pm and we still hadn't done everything (although we gave some kiddy rides a miss on purpose and went on some rides multiple times).We contemplated getting fast passes but didn't. SO happy we decided against it as apart from the rides I mentioned we practically walked straight onto the others. We went midweek, Wednesday, so yes it might be worth it at the weekend. Overall we had a fantastic day and I would definitely visit again if I get the chance to return to Singapore!

review_413767895,"“Super fun for kids and off course, adult too love”","Every year we ensure to visit Universal studio at least once. Kids really go mad at various rides and attractions at the Universal. This time we tried the Mummy Ride, was really thrilling. The best fun is the transformer 3D ride, the ultimate and worth waiting in line for 1 hour. If you go on a sunday or a public holiday, be ready to wait in a line for atleast 45 to 1 hours for various rides. Food at the Dinosaur restaurant was great. The full day goes like a wink and when you realize it's time to go back.

You are allowed to bring your own water in and our bags weren't searched upon entry. We got in early (10:30) and had got onto four rides by 12:00. We really enjoyed the transformer ride (amazing), and the Indoor mummy ride (except for the lady that screamed at everyone for queuing up - there were no signs around telling us what to do, nor was it busy (only around 10 people waiting in line) - some training needs to be done on customer service and clearer signs put on the ride. This is an amusement park and they should be selling joy/fun and negativity should not be part of the experience. Of course, this was an isolated incident and the rest of the ride was great! We also did Shrek 4D and the Puss in Boots journey (it was just okay). Getting here before 12:00 really helps! Found that as the day went, the wait times got longer. Mostly just 15-20 minutes. We had a great day here and enjoyed all the shows!

Great day out.No huge thrill rides but what they do, they do well.Negatives are the queue times (but that is in every theme park). Biggest gripe, having to pay for lockers after 45 mins. Compulsory as you can't leave bags at the rides but you get 45min free time then get charged for time after. Average queue time 60+ mins. The waterworld stunt show was amazing and worth a visit.Food is also great and not badly priced. Staff in the restaurant are grumpy and unfriendly though.Worth doing but be prepared to wait and pay extras.

review_413362496,“Needs some TLC”,"First of all - nothing about this is Singaporean.....but I digress - the park doesn't pretend to be. Moving on. I was surprised about the state of park and how unclean it was. Not untidy with garbage - just not clean. Everywhere I looked there was something that could use some attention. Steps coming off the Madagascar ride looked like they hadn't seen a wash in....ever? On the treasure hunters ride the fake hippos and crocs were covered in algae and moss. There's accent lights broken off their bases all over the place. Just not spending money on upkeep I guess. To boot, on the shrek 4D ride somebody went through a exit thinking it was a way out and it shut down the entire far far away land for over an hour.....I realize it's not universals fault but....there wasn't any signs on the doors except exit. Seems like a pretty important thing to have if it takes down a whole section of the park. We wandered over to the water ride in Jurassic park only to have it also not operational also. The best ride of the place was the mummy. However if you have anything that resembles a bag they make you put it in a locker - which is fine - and the locker is free for the first 45 minutes. The kicker is that for every 20 minutes over the first 45 you have to pay $4 to get it back. You're going to pay every time - and they know it. On a busy day that is likely over $30 for a locker just to go on one ride. With the ticket price over $70 that just feels like gouging. Wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend.

The 3D transformers was also very worthwhile. Unfortunately the queuse times were excessive. My advice is to use a toilet before joining the cue and take some water. Paid a lot to get it to the park so to get value from this you must be there in the morning to get at least 3 rides under your belt.

Its way too busy, the size of the park struggles to manage with teh number of visitors, any of teh top rides are minimum 90 minute wait (pushing you to buy fast pass?) and food and drink concessions equally over run. Good rides suitable for adults and late teens are few and far between probably only 4 that meet the bill and of course these have the longest wait!Its not cheap esp if you buy the fast track tickets - which we succumbed to buy 2 for the kids else teh whole day would be spent queuing.Maybe better for under 10s? seems to me that there were more rides for that age group.

BUT its very long wait for those who don't have the express pass. If you really want to have a go at it. Buy the unlimited express pass. Its expensive but saves a truck load of your time! 2. The rest of the place is quite a lot of fun as well. We were all adults, but I would imagine that kids will have a really good time here! 3. Do take a look at the stores in each section they have some pretty interesting things and apparels. NOTE: You cannot club it with other things in Sentosa. You have to give it an entire day. If you are travelling with kids best you stay for 3 days in sentosa itself. If you have a senior citizen please carry your own wheel chair. On hot days the long walk can seem never ending for them!

There is something for everyone and its not too big a venue. Beware of the heat though so be sure to take water bottles with you and refill at any restroom. And ideally wear light cotton shirt/blouse!! Also lockers are available for free for 45 mins at a time - which allows you to go on a few rides and then go pick them up. We bought the express pass and we're very pleased we did. It allows you one fast track ride per ride - unless you invest in the unlimited express pass. We went on a Saturday (and to be honest, I was dreading the potential volume of people)... But with rain forecast, I think many people stayed away.... And to our good fortune, the rain stayed away!!

review_412165709,“Small But Fun”,"It has all the entertainment that a Universal Studio has to offer and is completely doable in a day.Some tips to save a few bucks:• We bought our tickets from KLOOK. We also compared its prices versus those of Skyline Travel. They’re similar. You can do either one, both substantially cheaper than the regular prices.• We went on a Friday in mid-summer. Queues are LONG~~~. Luckily, we had express passes, which you need to buy from Universal Studio’s official channels. We’re a pretty big group and not everyone is interested in taking all the rides. So, we bought several Express passes to share. There’re 2 types of Express pass – one allows one ride per game and an unlimited pass. With the “one-time” option, we only had to show our print-out at the queue. Could easily share among us. With the “unlimited”, we managed to do likewise for several rides until we did Transformer. There’s actually a station selling express pass there and the staff required us to change our paper pass to a wristband. Once we did, it’s locked up with one person and we could no longer share it. If you intend to share express pass like we did, do the Transformer ride last.

It is hot in Singapore, so we splashed out on Fast pass tickets to avoid queuing in the heat (not something we would normally do at a theme park). It's quite a small park but there is plenty to entertain for 6 hours or so. The transformers ride is totally amazing, we did it twice and you noticed more things second time around, it's worth going for this ride alone. Like most tourist things in Singapore, it's not a cheap day out. Our 12 year old boy, loves theme parks, so for us it was a must do.

review_411653950,“Disappointing! But I'm spoilt with the experience of the american park versions.”,"We arrived early, and joined the line to enter...we had already pre purchased our ticket in a Sentosa triple that included island entry, unlimited cable car, SEA Aquarium entry and universal studios entry. We have been to universal studios in LA as well as Florida so my review is governed by those standards. I have also been to the Gold Coast one(which by the way does not compare to the american versions).It is on a small scale perhaps 1/3 the size of the american theme parks. The park is divided into worlds for those that have never been and each world is built upon that theme with rides to match them and shops with the relevant souvenirs.The rides where few in each world, with only a couple in each and these where mostly roller coaster rides. My favourite ride would be the lost world wild river ride, only because it's one of the few that are different to a roller coaster, don't get me wrong, I love roller coasters but it becomes a little repetitive! If you are visiting and enjoy coaster rides I suggest you purchase a front of the line pass...it's well worth the money as otherwise you'll find yourself lining up for a 2 or 4minute ride for over well over 100 minutes in the heat, so you may only get a few rides in a day visit.If you cannot for some reason ride roller coaster rides, but want to experience the park, just buy your basic ticket for the cheapest price possible, go early and line up for the ones you can go on( the lost world wild raft ride is the most popular of these) so go there first before the lines become ridiculously long and enjoy the atmosphere, the lengths of the fabulous detailed structures, and the entertainment in feature films shown only here, street shows and other entertainment, and enlightening stunt shows. It is an experience that everyone should experience in their lifetime. Take plenty of money if you want to purchase souvenirs that you can only buy here in the park and food. As there are plenty of places to sit, eat and drink and get out of the heat. Or you can bring along your own but you will need to put it in a pay locker as many of the rides you cannot take even your camera!This park is larger and much better than the Gold Coast one if you are Australian and have been lucky enough to visit that park, so in my opinion you should make this park a must visit if you liked that one. But if you have been to the American versions you may like us e disappointed.

Get the express line if it's possible. Will cost u 50$ single entry each ride or 70 $ multiple. Which ever , express really saves you at least 30 minutes per ride waiting time.

The two rollercoaster rides based on the Battlestar Galactica theme are awesome and should not be missed (if you like rollercoasters, that is!) Just be prepared for very long queues - about one hour. If you can afford it, buy the express tickets as that slashes the waiting time considerably. The shows which take place during the day are also entertaining. My advice for the water ride - don't waste your money by putting your stuff in the locker (this one is not free like the others). Rather buy a raincoat for $4 to keep your phones and cameras dry.

review_411076249,“Definitely Buy The Express Pass”,"On our recent trip to Singapore, my family and I went to Universal Studios on Sentosa Island and it was a brilliant day indeed. Getting to Sentosa is very easy and there are several modes of transport to get there i.e. the monorail, cable car or just a taxi. We decided on getting there using an Uber cab which I recommend to those who are in large families! It's just a lot easier and more cost effective.We also bought our tickets for SGD$60 on klook.com which I highly recommend. We looked at offers on several websites and Klook offered the best rate so definitely have this app ready for your trip to Singapore! Upon arrival at the park, we noticed how crowded it was and decided to buy the express pass. At an additional SGD$60 per person, the price is steep but I highly recommend buying one especially if you only have a day to spend at the park. Lines are generally very long but because of the fast pass, we managed to finish all the rides at the park by 3pm and just spent the rest of time going on our favourite rides again. The longest we had to wait was 30 minutes for the Jurassic Park river ride which seems long but the normal line was 1.5 hours. The shortest we had to wait was just 1-2 minutes. The rides at the park were brilliant! Our family loved Revenge of the Mummy, the Galactica Rollercoasters and the Jurassic Park Lost Worlds Ride.We had a great day and highly recommend springing up for the Express Passes!

We purchased our tickets online and we were whisked through into the park, once we found our bearings we targeted the thrill seeker rides. My highlight was the Transformer ride and my son's was the coasters, simply amazing and I liked the fact you could leave to eat outside the park and re enter so you were not a captive audience. Young or not so young it is worth a visit but plan ahead, look for deals online or locally.

This is nothing like the USA Universal studios, but it has some fun attractions. Waterworld was by far the best fun. Lots of roller coasters that cater to all types. I'd hate to be there on a hot day as its concrete, concrete, concrete. Just a good way to spend a cloudy day. Negatives are that not all rides had the priority pass lanes, which is weird considering the price is more than the entry price. Fun day, be prepared to sleep well that night, we were all pooped.

Two are water ride based.buying a fast track pass is advisable on busy days, specially on School holidays in Singapore. It saves lot of waiting time. Fast track tickets are available in side the park as well and no ques. In water based rides you are warned saying you are going to get really wet and they suggest you to buy polythene covers. do not worry it ll be only few drops of water if at all. some times they say waiting time is more than 50 mins for fast track entry specially at the Lost World entrance. but this is a lie.Transformers, Egypt and Lost world are the best rides. 4D movies are really nice. so enjoy.

review_410556293,“Great fun”,"Once you enter Universal Studios, you also become a child- wanting to take all the rides & reliving and identifying with the cartoon characters you had loved during your childhood days. Okay, these characters are comparatively new, but still you try to fantasise..The rides are fantastic, specially ""The revenge of the Mummy"" (Ancient Egypt) & Battlestar Galactica ""Cylon"" rides. A must visit section - ""Lights! Camera! Action"" by Steven Spielberg, really awesome & thrilling and an experience.Various stores selling themed merchandise- Minions, Madagascar, Transformers, Shrek, etc. and live performances by look-alike of Marilyn Monroe & Cleopatra, just too good. Last but not the least 'The Lost World' & 'Waterworld' deserve a special mention.One should buy Express ticket to enjoy all the rides and avoid long- long queues which drain you of energy & precious time. As such it would take atleast 4 to 5 hours to complete the full circuit (with selective rides only). And as the Sun sets and lights are on .. - a different place all together.

The entrance price, like most things in Singapore was not cheap (around 90 dollars each??). The Transformers ride is what you should run for as soon as you arrive, the airing time grows quickly. None of the rides are as fast and furious as you would find elsewhere, Universal Studios have really played to their strengths and focused on their digital abilities to create innovative augmented and virtual reality rides. Expect to queue and don't get too excited about the food, but a great experience and I was very happy to have been!

I would consider the fast pass if it is a busy day (you can upgrade on the day inside) Given how much rain Singapore gets it was not really set up for rain. Limited under cover areas and a lot of rides shut down if there is lightening. If you have flexibility on when you go I would be checking the weather and trying to pick a low chance of lightning / rain day.

review_410348153,“Ruined by economic rationalism”,"Being a fan of theme parks and having visited many across the world, this was going to be a special treat. Sadly, it wasn't up to Singapore's high standards.It becomes clear fairly quickly that if you only pay for a normal ticket, you have to be prepared to wait in queues for a long time and make up for the cheaper ticket by paying for extras.The irony is that the more time a customer spends waiting in long queues, they are not buying anything. They are not in the shops, they are not buying food or drinks. We spent about five hours in queues which were mostly boring and hot. Thankfully there are water fountains positioned in most queues.The better, more exciting rides, don't allow you to take anything in the queue. So, if you are in the queue for the Cylon ride (best in the park) you can't use your mobile device to while away the 100 plus minutes (on a normal weekday). Other parks have a spot to leave last minute items as you board the ride. Good move. Spectacles are the only items allowed in the queue.Instead, Universal provide free lockers. Sounds good until you see the time limit: 45 minutes! When you return to your locker, you have to pay to retrieve your belongings. We had everything taken off us, including wallets. If you don't have money and the time limit has expired you can't retrieve your things easily. Another time waster. Keep some cash on you but the machine doesn't give change! Credit cards are accepted but Singapore uses six-digit PINs so if you have a four digit number, it may not work.So, a ride costs you an hour or two plus an additional $4 for the locker!If you have the money a Universal Express ticket will save time and you shouldn't have to pay the locker fee.Compare with Disneyland which has a system where you can get a ride ticket for a particular time, go away and do something useful and come back in time for your ride. It's like reserving a place in the queue. Good system and no extra cost.If Disneyland markets itself as the happiest place on earth, Universal Studios Singapore (not Hollywood) is a utilitarian place that processes customers as 'bums on seats' rather than guests. The staff were efficient but mostly dour and disengaged.The grounds and general condition of Universal Studios are showing wear and tear which is not up to Sentosa's standards.Food is barely acceptably at the cheap end ie Mel's Diner. This should have been a good novelty destination but a McDonalds would have been better. There are more expensive options if you have loads of cash. Hopefully they serve better quality food.On the plus side, the 'Waterworld' is a very good live production. A bit cheesy but well choreographed and quite spectacular if you want some exciting pictures to take home.The Cylon ride is hard to beat. One of the best on the planet IMHO.Free wifi across Sentosa is brilliant. Transport is easy and cheap.By all means go to Universal Studios but if you have children with you you may have difficulty keeping them amused in queues. You will spend a lot more money than you expected just to do normal things like getting on a ride and buying food and drinks.

We were a bit unfortunate to pick a 40 degree day. That aside we looked forward to trying every ride. We arrived on opening time and the crowds were extraordinary, worst I've encountered. The shortest wait for a ride was 45 minutes. If we had youngsters in tow it would have been a nightmare. As it was, it was hectic.The Waterworld Show was excellent. The rides were all high quality. The park is clean. Food and drink are expensive.Be prepared for all this if/when you go.We found that after about 2pm the crowd thinned out considerably. Since the park is open till 9pm my tip would be to go after lunch and it should be quicker to get on rides.

review_410328244,“Universal pricey but delivers.....”,"We stopped in Singers for nearly a week after an Australia - Singapore cruise. Traveled with 3 teenage sons - family of five. Whether your kids are little, teenagers or you are just a kid at heart Universal is well worth a visit. We opted for the 2 day pass for Sentosa that covered 1 day at Universal and 1 day doing the other attractions at Sentosa - best value for money and could easily have spent another day there. We have spent a lot of time over the years at the Gold Coast theme parks and Universal Singapore certainly blows them away! One huge tip - pay extra for the express ride pass if you intend doing them a lot - well worth the extra A$50/day when you don't have to stand on a huge line for an hour or more in Singapore's heat and humidity. Majority of cafes and eating areas are air conditioned and provided welcome respite, they are expensive, but what theme park food and drink isn't - take plenty of your own bottled water with you! My teenage sons loved Universal as well as Sentosa in general - well worth the money and just a short taxi drive from CDB about S$10 - S$15 - beware however if you return after 5pm the rates go up.

review_409909477,“A must-see attraction of Singapore”,"You can't go to Singapore and not visit Universal Studios Singapore (USS).Tickets tend to be pricey. The popular ticket tends to be a day-use ticket (or other ticket options available on the USS website - ticketing booths are also there if you wish to physically buy tickets)The express pass gives you the chance to access the best rides in USS through a much much shorter queue.The express pass needs to be bought separately from the entrance ticket. In my opinion, you cannot visit USS in a day unless you have purchased the express pass.Watch out for the chance to grab photos with masked and dressed up superheroes (e.g. from Transformers, Sesame Street, Madagascar, etc)My personal favourite was the Transformers 4D ride.Waiting for the monorail back and forth from Sentosa station can really drain you and may be a big issue. At peak times, the monorail is absolutely packed and the queues to hop onto the monorail can be unbelievable. I do not have a solution to that in mind since pretty much everyone depends on the monorail.Tips:Carry an empty bottle of water into USS so as to replenish from the free water filters. You will have to rehydrate because of the warmth and humidity.Buy tickets beforehand online because of the discounts or promotional campaigns that may be on offer.Food is extremely expensive. Snack bars or anything like that can be really handy and a life saver.There is a 7-11 near the monorail stop leading to USS. McD etc are available in a neighbouring building (outside of USS) (Keep in mind you may re-enter USS with a day pass)

It is a lovely theme park, on the small side but we have recently been to Disneyland Anaheim. We enjoyed the Transformers ride, and Puss in Boots the most. Our daredevil children rode the blue and red rollercoaster ride and enjoyed them.

review_409080894,“The best universal I've visited”,"I decided to take my partner to visit Universal Studios during our tour of SingaporeHaving been to both Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Orlando I was not expecting it to match up to these but I couldn't of been more wrong.We had pre-booked our unlimited fast track tickets online which is a MUST for this park as it can get busy. This way we were not troubled by the entrance queue or queue for any rides.The Mummy ride and the Battlestar Galactica were excellent thrill rides but the Jurassic Park Rapids and Madagascar rides were also good fun.The free locker system is a great idea as you can store your belongings for a short period of time whilst you go on certain rides.The shows were good and the food was surprisingly good. All in all a good experience and throughly enjoyed my day.TOP TIP: get a fast track unlimited pass!

Standing in the heat for 2 hours is a long time so by the end of the day, you do start to wonder was it worth it all. The gift stores are pretty standard, no quality gifts to be brought and the food that you buy in the place is pretty expensive and average. They do have a starbucks so you can get a decent coffee. The kids will enjoy it, maybe not the adults so much. There are rides for all ages.

The park then just go worse and so did the heat. The staff at Singapore need to go to Florida to see how it should be done.There was no slick movement of crowds and it just left you feeling that they had taken your money and did not give a stuff what the experience was like or how long the wait times were.We waited 50 mins for the mummy going as single riders, which should be quick only to find one coaster being used, what did they need a written invite to get out the other one and half the times. Transformers was an hour, Jurassic park water ride an hour while the Battlestar rides were120mins each.We went on Monday, God only knows what the weekend would be like, I asked a member of staff why it was so busy and she said this was a normal day.I would say go early opens at 10am , plan the big ones and get them done then fill in with shows and achievable rides for the afternoon.Good luck and remember to drink lots and think cool thoughts while in those long wait lines.

Sure - all the rides are still entertaining, albeit the queue to get in was astronomical ........... When you get in - queue again.I bought the annual fast pass supplement , which gave faster access to several of the attractions. Extremely disappointed to note they are still selling the fast pass supplements, but have withdrawn fast pass access on two of the attractions ( Ancient Egypt car ride and Enchanted Airways) staff at Ancient Egypt were just off hand and said it had been discontinued. Staff on this ride seem to have some adjustment disorder and are not very friendly at all - daylight robbery!!! Just another way of conning you!!! Mentioned this to the staff who are just not interested.Keen to take your money - reluctant to deliver. Certainly not as good value as it was. Don't even think of going without a fast pass - the heat is unbearable even with the parks shady areas. Could be far better than it is.

review_407756452,“Another visit”,"This is my second visit to USS. This is not as massive as most of US in the world but it is compact and comparable with the rest US. I have tried most of the ride except the roller coaster which look to scary for an acrophobia like me. I like the Transformer ride so much that I ride it twice. Then the Mummy ride is also great. The water world show is so real that we enjoy it so much and this is a never missed show when you are in USS. The best thing the smaller scale of the USS is we can run in a short time to catch up with the show in the different attraction. Another one is that we can almost cover up the place in only one day if it is not over crowded. The parade is one of the waited show and it is a perfect ending for the visit. Catch up with the Madagascar in land of far-far away and enter the castle. Souvenir..I love how various type of souvenir they have. I buy the tall bottle with a grip which now I use to hang my cardholders. The USS is a real example of limitless joy in a limited space.

review_407743389,“Amazing but average”,"This is a must see experience. The atmosphere is great and there is all round entertainment going on. But that is where the wonder of the park ends. If you are just content to wonder around and take in the atmosphere, it is a great place to see.But if you want to get on the rides, be prepared to wait.You will need to get another day pass to experience everything at the theme park.Waiting times for rides such as the Transformers can be 3 hours (standing). Battlestart Galactica was 2 hours, and if you had put your stuff in a locker as required and exceed the time alloted for the ride, you will be required to pay for the locker. The wait for the Jurrasic Park ride was 2 hours.We only managed the above 3 rides before it was time to leave the park. Although the rides were great, when you work it out, it was not really not value for your money.If you had purchased an ""express ticket"", your wait would have been about half of that time. Perhaps, a roaming team member offering complimentary water may have made the wait a bit more bearable, especially in the heat.A minor let down was some of the visitors to the park seemed to queue jump. I witnessed this on every ride that I queued up for. It would seem the time honoured discipline of queing in Singapore did not apply in the theme park. To be fair to Singaporeans, the queue jumpers appeared to be tourists rather than your average Singaporean. No one seemed to be supervising the queues.Finally, for a place renowned for it's food, the food at the park was overpriced and disappointing.All in, would I go there again? NoWould I recommend it to another, Yes, but be prepared for the wait, if you are going on the rides .... and the queue jumpers.

You can buy your Universal Studios Singapore (USS) tickets there and a ticket to the the first station (around $4) or you can use your MRT card, When you get to the station, USS is a short walk to the left, well sign posted. You can exit USS with a stamp (you cant at other US like Osaka). USS has Transformers, The Revenge of the Mummy, Lost World, Shrek Castle and Madagascar to name a few. Our favorite is the The Mummy, which is air conditioned for most of the entry, although you need to place bags, etc into a locker that works by finger scan, it is very hot and humid in the locker area and if you have problems with your locker, it can get very frustrating while waiting for assistance.

We came from the city so we rode the MRT to Vivo City and took the train to Sentosa which brought us directly to Universal Studios. At 10:30am, the place was packed with queues stretching almost to the Hershey's outlet. There are more attractions than rides all geared towards the magic of movie making. What I really enjoyed was the Terminator ride which saw us being in the middle of the fight between the giant robots. It was such a thrill. Food options are plentiful although you have to (carefully) pick and choose where to have your meals.We stayed long enough to watch the afternoon parade filled with Universal Studios starts and characters.

review_407011173,“Fantastic sets and atmosphere but definitely express yourself!”,"As you'd expect, Universal Studios is pretty impressive but as you'd also expect, it's very popular and therefore be prepared to wait...a lot! If you wanted to make the most of your day here, do yourself a favour and get an Express pass.We were with a 2yo who could only go on a handful of rides so we didn't see the value in buying the Express pass but if he was 122cm plus in height (the key height to accessing most rides) I wouldn't hesitate to pay the $70 per person.We arrived at opening time of 10am and it took half an hour to get through the gates (with already purchased tickets), and from there, the rides were a minimum 30 minute wait and most around a 60 minute wait. Without an express pass, you'd probably get to do 5-6 rides. This was on a Thursday-imagine a weekend or school holidays!On the positive, the themed areas were spectacular and really took you to the scene of each movie. The music playing in each zone adds to the excitement and the detail of each building, shop, restaurant and ride is definitely pretty amazing. The roller coasters and thrill rides all looked pretty spectacular and there was a nice range of rides for little kids too-from the Madagascar crate ride to the Dino Soaring. One of the highlights was the Sesame Street show-the shows are definitely a great break from the heat and very entertaining.Universal Studios is definitely worth a visit but get yourself an express pass, break up the heat with some shows and time in the themed restaurants/eateries, and be prepared to spend some money-you can't bring food into the park and to eat and drink is pretty expensive!A little hint: getting to Sentosa from downtown Singapore is a bit of a mission with swapping MRTs and then getting through Harbourside/Vivocity to the packed Sentosa Express. For around $15, a taxi will drop you to the Sentosa Island hub (including S.E.A Aquarium, Universal Studios) in about a quarter of the time it took us to get there from Bugis Junction !

We left very disappointed and only made it onto 3 rides for the day and they weren't even rides we wanted to try, just rides with short lines (30-40 minutes). It was hotter than I thought so hot that we melted, really not into waiting I. Long lines. Can't justify the extra cost for short waits either since it's so expensive to start with.

review_406839569,“Express pass is the way to go”,"Long queues everywhere. great attractions such as the Mummy and transformers is a must but you will have to wait a long time to get on it. you will need an express pass if you dont want to wait a long time. average waiting time on these rides is about 45 - 90 minutes. The elmo ride was the longest. the line was deceiving as at first I thought there was no queue then you turn outside and boom there it is. definitely wont be doing that again. if you are here from the morning make sure to wear a hat bring a water parka. some rides will get you wet. Buy your ticket at the airport as they will give you discount and also meal voucher to be used in the Malaysia street food court. and yes eat here not at the places inside universal studio.

review_406818185,“Impressed”,"Loved this place, a little different to Universal Studios in LA insofar they don't have the tram ride through the studio lot showing stage sets, etc., very much runs along the lines of a Disneyland. Some great rides which can attract huge queues so my biggest tip to visitors is buy the one per ride queue jumper. They have 3 types of tickets; general admission, queue jumper where you can do this once on each ride and a queue jumper where it is unlimited. We went for the unlimited which cost quite a bit more but we found out we ended up only going on each ride once as the park gets very crowded and we were moving from one ride to the other. There are a few attractions where you saw how movies are made and all in all we had a great day. Frozen mango drink worth every cent :-)

review_406634454,“Fun”,"Have visited Los Angeles and Orlando parks, which are truthfully way better and bigger. But we still had a great day here.Visited on a Wednesday and we got in just before 11am and many of the big rides had 60 minutes wait already. We decided to buy the express pass at $60 which we hoped to reduce times. But not really. We ended up just doing a bunch of kids stuff had some lunch and then after about 2pm noticed a lot of ride wait times coming down. With the express pass we used on the big roller coasters, Jurassic park and transformers. We didn't wait any longer than 5 min on any, and this was with the wait times still between 60-90 minutes.So my tip would be if hating to wait in lines. Spend the extra money on the express pass, but wait till later in the afternoon and use it then when most others have already used their express pass up.Even though the park is smaller this other universals it's still great for anyone of all ages.

Buying your admission through Klook, then get the express pass when you get there is the best way to go. Express pass gives you express entry into all rides one time. We didn't wait longer than 20min. Transformers is absolutely amazing, The Mummy in close 2nd. Roller coasters are great too. Aside from those 3 rides, the rest are not as thrilling, and more appropriate for kids. As an adult couple we had a great time however.

Great for family and fun with the kids, rides like Human and Cylon, transformer 3D are the most people choice which all of us really enjoy unfortunately we need to wait minimum of 1hr and 20mins each ride before we can enjoy as little as almost 2mins but its worth waiting. Revenger Mummy & Water World is also a must to experience..

review_406407947,“Do research first before come here”,"Do some research online or ask around before pick a date come here!i go on weekday because many people say weekday is not crowd but i was wrong, It was terrible crowded, every attraction u have to wait a least 40-60 minute so just buy the express ticket to save your time or u will stand all day long until your leg get hurt.u have to consider which country is on public holiday, summer holiday or whatever holiday.Beside the holiday issue, the weather is also a big issue, check the weather before come here, the weather of the day i visit is like 35 Celsius, ya, super hot and i saw many people sweating and having low mood. So u will need to prepare the hat , umbrella, wear as light as possible, prepare the water bottle, tower or tissue maybe if u easy get sweating.dont bring too much things, just bring a small bag so u can placed ur small bag in the locker in some attraction that not allow u bring anything while play the ride. There are few locker near the attraction, the locker is free according to the waiting time, u will be fined if exceed the time.Overall the attraction is fun with super exciting ride like mummy,transformer and many other, I was only able to play few before the closed of park due to waiting time is too long. The food here is good and tasty Tips: after enter the park, just rush to transformer ride because this attraction will always having the super long queue, u can take picture after then

review_406375111,"“TRANSFORMERS & Waterworld, DO NOT MISS THOSE!”","A small Universal Studios park which we still couldn't complete touring in one whole day, this movie magic paradise features entertainment for all ages in #epic proportions. A must-visit when in Singapore. Do check out the showtimes for specific performances so as not to miss great shows like the Sesame Street performance, Meet the Minions, Hollywood Dreams Parade & Lakeside Show (specific dates only), and the ever so EPIC Waterworld show, with its awesome stunts, pyrotechnics and big splashes. Also recommended is the Lights, Camera, Action by Steven Spielberg which features a Category 5 hurricane simulation (also be ready to get wet here if you're in the front row).The winner hands down is, as always, Transformers: The Ride. 90 minutes wait in line (buying the Express ticket doesn't really help much either thanks to the high volume of visitors)... but well worth it! And definitely more entertaining than any of the Michael Bay movies. In fact, this is how (I expected) a Transformers movie SHOULD BE. But Michael Bay wasted too much time on ""developing"" annoying characters, highschool romance/college humour nonsense, ""the chicks"", the US military gunghoness etc than the actual robots, their home Cybertron, *their* story, which is what TRANSFORMERS was always about. Few minutes of The Ride made you feel like you were part of the Transformers universe, and a REAL Transformers movie! Epic!

review_405961280,"“Buy the express card, its a must.”","Went here on a Monday and was surprised by the large volume of people. Was torn on buying express passes for my wife and 3 year old boy but was glad to have done so. They cost $120 Singapore dollars in addition to the entrance fee so this is a very expensive price. However, the lines inside were very long and the weather very hot with only some ceiling fans offering minimal cooling, so if you go on a busy day or have a young child, I recommend paying the price. There are only a few attraction per theme and a height limit for some so those with young children should take this in mind.

review_405897172,"“Worthwhile, but should be bigger and less money-hungry”","Introduction:I went to USS during a Singapore short trip with my fiancé in summer 2016. We entered the park with the unlimited express pass, after a bad experience in the Universal Studios in Osaka.Attractions:Good variety, fun rides, but way too small in number. If you own the Express Pass, you will be done with everything in less than half a day. We definitely enjoyed the Transformers 4D Ride the most.Prices: While the day ticket price is acceptable, it gets blown out of proportion with the Express Pass that cost the same as the actual ticket. Prices for food and drinks are hardly acceptable, and photographers waiting for extra cash (around 25 Singapore Dollar) for a photo with the characters of the park make it just too expensive. The least they could do is include the photos in the Express Pass fee.Staff:Rarely have I met a less motivated bunch of people. I understand that it is not fun selling Elmo Ventilators 8 hours a day, but watching these sad faces it either incredibly funny or incredibly sad, your pick.Recommended?During a stay in Singapore, sure. But if you are looking for a serious Theme Park-a-olic, better search elsewhere.

review_405643788,“The Transformers Ride - is a must - it is the best!!”,"After many visits to Singapore, today was my first time to Universal Studios at Sentosa.I thought today (Monday) would be quiet....I was wrong - it was busy....I purchased a ticket in advance to save time.....well...an hour in the queue just to get in along with a thousand or more others at 10.30am.Finally got in around 11.30am....don't let that perturb you...the whole day is fun and a good adventure.Next time I will buy an express ticket as I would have saved about three hours waiting all told just for three activities.Sesame Street show - for kids - not bad at all - worth queuing for twenty or so minutesSesame Street Spaghetti Space Race - got into the queue - heard an announcement saying the ride was temporarily out of action for an hour or so...got out of that queue.Watched the Rockafellas dance show on the Broadway street corner at 2pm...that was great....breakdancing and acrobat action - lots of fun and enthusiasm from the act and park visitors.Best of all was the Transformers Ride - it had action, 3D motion - scary stuff - unbelievable graphics....probably the best ride I have been. It was well worth the hour or so queueing. ""DO NOT MISS THE TRANSFORMERS RIDE"" I enjoyed a few breaks during my visit, Starbucks for coffee...KT's Grill for lunch and Mel's DriveIn for a cool drink before I left at 5pm.The Minions were popular...for young and old - great photo opportunities there.I will definitely be back to see the remainder of the park...I only saw 20% today.

review_405598039,“Awesome day out”,"After reading many of the reviews, I changed our original plan to arrive at opening at 10am and we arrived on the island at around midday. We visited the Aquarium first and then made it into Universal Studios at around 1.30pm. We purchased our express pass straight away and while the longest wait time was at 75 minutes, we only had to wait 15 mins and that was only for one of the more popular roller coasters. As it got later in the day the wait times were much less and with the express pass, we hardly had to wait at all. Fave rides were the Mummy and Transformers. Catching the MRT and then the monorail (Sentosa Express) was easy. We left at around 6.30pm and while there was a long line for the monorail, it moved very quickly with only a 15-20 min wait time. Plenty of places to eat inside, whether for a sit down meal or snacks. We ate at KTs Grill in the New York section which had fairly decent food (salads, burgers, sandwiches etc.) Not a cheap day out (especially with the express pass costing $70) but definitely worth it.

review_404925932,“A fun day to remember”,"This is a must if in Singapore and especially wiht kids. few important tips, please please purchase the unlimited express pass as this made the biggest diffeence. You pay much more than the normal pass of course but worth every penny. Make sure you also get there before 10 am to benefit from the money you are spending. because of the express pass you get to enter from a seperate gate where there is no queue. Our bags were not checked for food so could be just a one of case but I would certainly recommend carrying a water bottle. This can be fllled at several water coolers all around the place. wear and carry adequate sunscreen and yes please do carry caps and I would recommend parasols too...the heat can really get to you so am so glad we too umberellas and used them. In terms of rides we were two adults and 2 kids. and I had done a lot of reading bout what I should definitely try. There are some amazing rides and as someone mentioned if you want to the adult rides as soon as you enter universal take the right. if you have kids and want to focus on their rides take the immediate left which will bring you to the Madagascar area. Ensure you do pick up a map at the entrance as this is certainly needed. we carrie a stroller and honest did not have any problems taking one along. In each area there a place where you can keep the strollers and trust me this is not veyr far from the rides itself. Also please ensure you wear comfy clothing. shorts and tshirts or sleeveless tops are highly recommended. Also carry sanitiser and lots of wet wipes if travelling with kids.

Sad thing was that the express pass at some attractions were only marginally better than the normal que.

Then head over the Jurassic park rapids ride coz this opens about an hour later. Getting there early will save you hours in the ques.Great experience if not for wasting money on express passes.

The lines are HUGE. Even people who bought a fast track were simply cutting the queue by half. The waiting time is minimum 30 mins for most rides. My advice is to either ride as a single rider since they simply fill the gaps with single riders so the line goes faster. One other advice is to remove all your belongings and put them in the locker or get a rain coat since you will get soaking wet at the JURASSIC PARK.

Hot tips I would share are : -Don't buy tickets until you arrive at airport as much cheaper and you can go any day as online you must go on date you book which is good with kids if plan goes pear shaped - I didn't buy fast pass and glad I didn't as you can buy them all throughout the park if you need to-go at 9am and have pancakes in a fab place just before the USS gates then get to gates for 9.30 no later - I went left after Hollywood and started the Madagascar way then forever ever land then Jurassic world just in time for it opening at 11am. This route works perfectly and didn't wait anymore than 15 mins and most times first in the que- we had lunch at 11.30 before the crowds and then headed out when everyone started to come in for lunch so again missed the ques- the only one we missed was transformers with a 2 hour wait. So if this is a favorite I would recommend going there first and then headed back in the same route - take lots of plastic ziplock bags for wet clothes and to protect dry ones - don't leave for taxi after 4pm as it goes manic. We got there for 3.45 and it was perfect but wow in 15 mins massive long que. the taxi man said this when he dropped us off and really saved us. He said 5.30-6pm also quieter. - read up on tripadvisor as it really saved me on several factors Enjoy overall a fun day out for the little ones.

review_404438471,“Great family fun”,"Spent a day wondering around Universal Studios. Heaps of activities and rides to entertain the kids big and small. It was drizzling rain most of the day but was still lots of fun. Lots of rain coats were made available but the day was warm so did not need them. Lots of shopping for items relating to your favourite characters. Would recommend It for families.

review_404374351,“Long waiting time in lines for the rides”,"Long waiting hour as long as 2 hours to go on rides. No adequate staff to manage the day when large crowd visit the place(Eg:- 9 Aug 2016). Recommend tourists to check and purchase the Universal Express Tickets which is about S$60 per head but that pass was also not valid for some rides. The thrill and enjoyment was lost because of these waiting times. No adequate cooling fans for the people waiting in the line. I have visited similar places in Dubai , AbuDhabi, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia and when it comes to quality of the experience, service and value for money I will rank this place very low and below expectation.

After that, pretty much you can proceed to the other attractions at your own pace. Great day out for the family!

Though it was super hot during our trip last summer, March 2016 we nevertheless, chose to enjoy it up to the last bit. The Transformer Ride was gruesome, but nothing can beat the Ancient Egypt Ride, I thought I was going to die because of the stomach and head banging ride! It was good while it lasted and I kept screaming at the top of my lungs to release stress! All other rides and sights were a welcome experience after that.Vin Diesel was cool while Frankenstein was super cute...The afternoon live show was nostalgic with great and known Americal songs sang splendidly by the performers. The old cars on exhibit was super cool, too. Shrek and Fiona were roaming around much to the delight of the kids and the oldies alike. Hollywood Street was full of great stores for photo opportunities. At the Marina//Bay Area where we sat for awhile, we had a great time resting while listening to the overhead songs being played. It was a great way to spend our 2016 summer.

review_403247062,"“A good park, but with some problems”","Universal Studios Singapore is an excellent experience, both for tourists and residents, and is definately worth visiting during a trip to Singapore. The park itself is large, very well built and visuall pleasing, as well as well situated, taking only a fifteen minute Taxi ride from the centre of Singapore and has good value for money. Of particular note are the attractions; unlike other theme parks that contain mostly rollercoasters, this park has a wide variety of rides to suit all ages, with the different lands of the park catering to all demographics. Personal highlights include:* The Transformers Ride, which is great fun for most ages and honestly the best ride in the park. Give it a try, it's awesome! * The Battlestar Gallactaca Coasters, the world's tallest duelling coasters, of which the blue one is especially fun for thrill-seekers.* The Waterworld Show, which is on three times a day and is very entertaining to watch with great action. * The Daily Parade, which features characters and entertainers based on all five lands of the park, and is visually stunning.* The Jurassic Park Rapids, a fun family water ride that, while not as good as its counterparts in America, is still very well designed.* The Revenge of the Mummy Rollercoaster, a brilliantly themed ride that feels like a cinematic experience, but may be too scary for young children. As you can see by my list (which barely covers even a third of the total attractions in the park) the park offers a lot with good value for money, although drinks and food (despite being relatively high quality) can get expensive for large groups as you are not permitted to bring food/beverages into the park. I only have two small complaints:* The park, as it isn't essentially your standard ""tourist"" attraction, but popular with everyone, can get very, very crowded, especially on public holidays like when we visited. As a result, ride wait times can skyrocket, like it did with us, resulting in most rides having a 45 minute plus wait time at minimum, although the rides are worth it for the most part. You may want to skip the lines... Which brings me on to my next complaint...* The ""fast pass"" situation is tricky. On one hand, on a day as busy as mine, fast pass is practically required to get on everything in one day, but on the other hand, fast pass isn't that fast. Even with the pass, due to the way they load/unload rides, you will be waiting a solid ten minutes minimum before getting to ride. Perhaps that was only due to how busy the park was, but even though it lets you skip 90% of the queue, it isn't a pass straight onto them, which is dissapointing. Still though, take this with a grain of salt, as the park was VERY busy when we visisted, and may work very differently when you visit.Despite these complaints, the park still contains all the rides you would expect from a Universal Studios, and is a great experience overall, so I definately recommend visiting, especially if you have young children or teenagers. A very good theme park, even if it can't stand up to bigger, better, similar parks in America and elsewhere.

review_403241544,“Be prepared to queue”,"Second time here. Went on eve of National Day so the crowd was understandably large. But it seems that they still have not done much in terms of improving their Wait Time at each ride. So be prepared to queue in line for very long at each ride, even the kiddy ones. DinoSoaring(kiddy ride) -25 mins, Spinning thingy at Sci-fi City (kiddy ride)- 30mins; Madagascar - 50mins; Rapids at Jurassic Park - 85mins; Transformer- 90mins (moving queue); Galactica -130mins (we gave up). The only short wait time was at the kiddy Carousel Merry Go Round- 5mins (but we didn't bother).Nonetheless we enjoyed the rides we got on and the shows we watched. And there were many many photo opps. (Esp. in Hollywood)Please make it a point to catch Waterworld at 12pm or 5pm. That show alone can make your day at USS worth it!

review_403025163,“Great Fun with young kids”,"Hi. We visited on August 8, 2016 with 2 kids. One on the autism spectrum. For special need, can obtain Express Pass (comes with unlimited rides - ie, can go to the same rides again and again with this pass) for 1 special need child and 1 accompanying adult. We bought the express pass for the rest of the family so that we can all go to the Express Q. Although it was expensive, it was really worth it. Most q were less than 10-15 min wait. Unfortunately, I can't seem to see special diet meal. Mayb there is somewhere . I didn't research well on this part as I had home packed lunch for my child who has food intolerance. We didn't go to all the rides as some rides are just too adventurous for my kids. Eg, roller coaster, transformer rides, etc. Take note that for Treasure Hunters in Ancient Egypt, there isn't a q separately for Express Pass. However upon explaining my child is Autistic, the cast member kindly let us into another lane with no q. Thank you for all the cast members for being so understanding! My boy absolutely had a ball! This is a slow, short ride no minimum sound effect. Madagascar boat ride - slow moving, contain darkness, loud sound effect. I personally enjoyed it very much. We had lunch around 12 noon. Still pretty quiet and less crowd. By 2pm when we had snack and drinks, it was super crowded in 2 eateries we walked in. So I guess most restaurant are generally pretty full then. Overall great great experience still.

I really wished I hadn't bothered. Queuing times was 180 minutes at one point and there are only 3 big roller coasters, managed to get on two of them. After queueing for 90 minutes, the ride breaks down- really had enough by that point and that was only our second choice of ride! Feels like everyone has express pass so makes the queuing even more longer as obviously they get priority and sometimes that queue is just as long! Stupid locker system which is rammed with everyone else trying to do the same thing. You get charged for the locker if you go over the free allocated time and have to pay to unlock it but how when your bag is inside the locker with your money??? Ended up paying $63 for 4 rides what a disappointment. Too small for the amount of people that visits. However went on the Sentosa luge and sky ride afterwards and had more fun in an hour then we had had all day!!Visit but get express pass for sure!!!!!

The park is crowded and the weather doesn't help. Some places have fans for waiting queues but most don't or don't have them working. - Value for money. Given the wait time there weren't many rides that we were able to take. The express pass is $90 over and above the standard $75 entry fee for a day! That is very pricey for the experience.

review_402715452,“Too crowded and expensive ”,"Went on a Monday and it was packed. Almost every ride was 60-130 minutes queue time from 10.30 onwards.So as we wanted to experience the rides we decided to buy a express pass for 70 bucks extra each! We've done this at theme parks in the UK and it had been worth it. At these parks they only sell a certain amount of fast passes and they are time specific. This means you get onto the ride very quickly - it's actually a fast pass - and it doesn't effect the normal queue time too much. After buying the pass we went to queue up and found the express queue to be pretty much as long as the normal queue. I'm talking about 15-30 mins less and still over 30 mins for most rides. To ride the Battlestar Galactic coaster the express pass queue was 90 mins long!!! We felt pretty ripped off. It's clear Universal just want to sell as many of these as possible. But they have not made the experience customer friendly. This actually extends to the whole park where it seems like some better planning could have reduced the queue time on nearly all the rides, however, this would have made people less likely to buy express passes so I don't think they really even considered it. Apart from this the rides are pretty good. The park is pretty small. The prices are pretty high.

However, what it lacked in size, it more than made up for in cleanliness. Singapore is perhaps the cleanest city that I’ve ever been to. It was so refreshing to walk around in such pristine conditions all day long. Grant it, the temps were unrelenting but there are plenty of indoor rides and attractions that wallow you some respite from the weather conditions. We wavered on getting the fast pass but it was much more expensive and so we just took a chance and remarkably we were able to get on every action that we wanted to and still were finished with the park by 4:30!

review_402601848,“A hell of a lot better than Disneyland.”,"It seems all universal studios Parks are better than Disney. I had an annual pass, with the express passes. This meant that I only took 5 minutes to queue up. That deal was $365, and you can come here every single day. The attraction I least recommend is the Sesame Street show, it's plain dull and I had to sit next to a local girl who was screaming like hell. But at least most of the staff are very polite. There are some rude staff the slip in here and there, but not as rude as disney's rude staff. They also even let the ratio of normal people:express pass be 1:1, instead of Disneyland's 1:1trillion. The rides are ""sort"" of thrilling, with the exception of the battle star Galactica ride. Also, queuing times to take photos with stars? 3 minutes. That's 72 less than Disneyland, or shall I say the idiot's amusement park. In the end, thank you very much to one of the staff at the mummy ride for knowing me and taking me to the front of the line. I will most definitely visit again.

Staying on Sentosa Island is very convenient if you are in Singapore for Universal Studios. The Waterworld show was a great treat. So much going on to keep you interested.

Particularly for young people as it could be a little tiring for senior people.The shows are amazing...particularly the Steven Spielberg show is awesome.Revenge of Mummy ride is just so thrilling... its fun.The other two rides of battlestar galactica had a huge que and we waited for 2 hrs and guess we should have skipped that and covered other shows since to see all the shows and other rides it's not worth waiting so long. Still these two rides were too adventurous.Jurassic park ride with rafting was amazing too. But there are chances of getting pretty wet... we went on a weekday so it was pretty less crowded... but some shows are particularly on weekends and some holidays. Do check before going.

review_401589541,“Fun but very busy and hot”,"We arrived at 10:30am via the cable car on a Thursday, hoping to beat the crowds but we were mistaken. It was already very crowded and the lines for the most popular rides were between 60-120 minutes. I didn't spend a bunch of money to wait in a hot line for that length of time so we decided to get the Express passes (I assume that's what Universal Studios is encouraging with the long wait times). Although it cost more than the entrance fee, the express passes allowed the kids to actually go on more than a couple of rides, and avoided standing in hot, smelly lines all day. We had burgers at the Diner and we enjoyed those. My favourite ride was the virtual reality Transformers, while my wife enjoyed the roller coaster at Ancient Egypt. My kids enjoyed all the rides but especially the Rapids Adventure at Jurassic park. I also enjoyed the Shrek 4D movie where the seats move and you get sprayed with mist in addition to the usual 3D effects. Take lots of water, or fill your bottles at the many water fountains around the park. Be prepared to spend a lot of money on food and souvenirs if you purchase these things. I recommend you go to the park and determine how long the wait times are for the major rides (roller coasters etc) and if the lines are more than 30min I suggest purchasing the express passes. You will be able to spend more time on rides (3x as many) and much less time standing in lines getting hotter and more annoyed by the minute. If at all possible, do your research and go during an off-peak period! Wish we could have done that.

review_401532572,“Great Family Day Out!”,"We purchased our tickets on line and went for the unlimited express line. We visited on a Thursday. No mater what you read on line about how it wasn't worth it don't believe it! Watching people wait 1 to 2 hours in non air conditioned corridors and lines looked painful. With the express we might have waited 20 mins tops for the Battle Star Galactica roller coaster. All other rides we 10-15 maximum. The Battle Star Galactica/cyclone roller coasters were the most popular. My kids loved the Revenge of the Mummy roller coaster and the transformers. Make sure you take in the lights, camera action show. Very well done. Also did the water world show at 17:00 which was busy but well worth seeing! Food is expensive, most rides make you put you belonging in lockers ($4) so pack light! Spent about S$100 on food for 5 of us. You can easily do the park in a day with the express pass. We arrived at 11:00 and had done some rides 4 times by 7:00pm. Some street shows (B-boys) and non ride activities (Shrek 4D Adventure) for those with squeamish stomachs

review_401209947,“Great destination for families”,"Slightly on the expensive side for the no of attractions it contains, one day is definitely not enough if you are on a leisure trip. Express pass is a must if you don't want to lose time in some never ending ques specially the roller coaster. You can purchase the express pass from one of the retail outlets inside the park so thats kinda helpful. We are a Muslim family and the park does not serve any Halal food so basically the choice would be limited to vegetarian only which in our case had run out at the hot dog stall. Overall a great place for a family getaway!

review_400656097,“Just above OKAY”,"unfortunately this is one of the most hyped attraction at sentosa island. Definitely a crowd puller here at sentosa. there are lot of rides for all ages. But family with kids would enjoy more as its more of a Fun-day out for Kids. For the extreme adrenaline junkies, there are only 2-3 rides. I really liked the mummy ride and transformer rides. Worth your money. Since this place is a tourist attraction of 'numero uno' of sorts at sentosa, expect to wait for 60-90 mins for each ride. There are dream parades that happen on saturdays.. check the schedule before going.. Alas we could not see it as it was cancelled due to rains!!.. You are in for one of those bad luck days if it happens to Rain when u are at USS! Rides would be cancelled, Parades called off and since its an open place with not much cover to accommodate the excessive overflow of tourists, you might as well get wet!

review_400436142,“Quite disappointing”,"Our family (with 2 bigger kids) had just been to the one in LA last year and had tremendous fun. This year, we decided to visit the one in Singapore too. To our disappointment, USS is so small that we finished all the shows/rides in slightly more that half a day. We were expecting long queues and even purchased a Fast Pass before entering the park. Boy, it was such a waste of money! Most rides require less than 20 minutes wait-time even without the pass. (This is actually a plus for most people!) When it comes to food inside the park, choices are very limited. We picked a self-serve cafeteria and staff there are not too friendly. No smiles, and just took away our trays without asking, when we still haven't finished our food.

review_400382422,“Just don't miss it!”,"I stayed in Singapore for more than 3.5 years but never got a chance to visit the Universal Studios. It frequently happens that we miss out good places in our backyard, the same thing happened with me as well.On my wife's birthday July 19, 2016 we decided to pay a visit to Universal Studios Singapore. It was a great visit and forever memorable. Here are a few tips for visitors if it helps!First things first - it's not the place with infants, unless you have someone with you who can take care of infants when you are taking rides. It would be tricky to go with toddlers too as they will not be meeting the minimum height criteria. Most of the rides need kids to be above 122 cm and a few need to be between 100-122 cm. So, decide on the company before you plan to visit.The most important rides are the Transformers Ride, Revenge of Mummy Ride, Jurassic park rapids adventure, 2 giant roller coasters (if you are interested). If possible, try to visit during weekdays and weekends will be completely packed up. We actually visited during middle of week, but still its very much packed. If you can afford a few more bucks, you can even buy a express ticket which has a special queue for almost all the rides. Two options for express ticket - one for single ride and other for multiple rides, costing S$50 and S$70 respectively. It will be useful when the park is full with visitors, you can cover most of the rides with this additional fast lane ticket. In any case, try to be there by 09:45 AM - 10:00 AM.Most of the people head towards the Transformers ride first, it being the premium one but it gets relatively free towards latter half of the day. So, you can go for multiple rides. If you don't want to get the fast lane (express) ticket, either be the first few to board the transformers ride or skip it for latter half of the day. There will be long queues for the big roller coasters - human and cylon. Simple - Human is for humans and Cylon gives a cyclone experience (turns upside down). Go for it if you are able to bear it.Revenge of mummy ride is very good too - super fast roller coaster in complete dark - a different experience. Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure is a good one and you may get soaked in water, so plan accordingly. Try to visit the Water world show at 5:00PM which gives a feeling of watching an action movie in real time. Finally don't skip the dance performances at Rockfeller Center in New York area.it's a must visit and needs 2 days at least to visit everything inside, however with fast lane ticket, you can cover upto 75% of rides on a single day!. Have fun and enjoy!

To maximize our fun and also to allocate time efficiently we booked the VIP tour even though it was a bit costly. We went on a week day since we wanted to avoid the rush but boy during the weekdays it was still crowded. That's the time we realize we made a wise decision to go ahead with the VIP tour. Our guide was very friendly and one of the nicest guys I have met in Singapore. For 6 hours he took us to all rides, shows and every inch of the place entering through back doors and skipping all the ques. It was great fun.

Not heavy, more drizzling. So we missed all the characters' meet & greet. However, our guide, Mizah, made sure we covered everything else on our with list! She was fantastic! She's also very good with children. She patiently answered all our kid's questions and made sure he was enjoying himself. If you're on the VIP tour and have kids, please ask for Mizah.

This being Singapore, it was really hot and humid, but they do a nice job of providing shade and fans as much as possible.

I'm not a one for rides, however, decided to queue for half an hour and do the Treasure something ride in Ancient Egypt and was bitterly disappointed. It went for about 5 minutes and there were no special effects that stood out like the ones I remembered in LA.

One of the important and major active you should to see it in Singapore in santosa island. The cost is SD74 for adults and 54 for child but online maybe you can book cheaper.

Conversion rate aside, everything is absolutely fairly priced and of quality - from attractions, decorations, landscaping, souvenirs and food.Huge shoutout and respect for the workers there for their professionalism from performers to attraction operators!The sole con is - the queue is loooooong and viney EVERYWHERE! I visited on a weekday (thursday), it wasn't a public nor school holiday in Singapore or neighbouring country either - the queue for attractions average at above 1 hour (up to 150 minutes, according to announcements: wutt!) One would need special VIP pass to cut the queueing time down. However, at the end of the day, we still managed to play in almost every attractions as the visitors leave the park and the queueing time shortened after 6pm.Great experience overall! Would recommend a more than a day stay in the Sentosa area!

Since we had a 4 year old we didn't opt for those anyway cause there is a height restriction. It's not a big Park so u can easily cover it in 3 to 4 hours if the lines to the rides are free...after 5 the rush was quite less nearly just 5 min wait. We saw the evening sesame show and a few other open shows. Overall a mist try but better to go on a weekday. Restrooms are quite clean and plenty in nos. Food was also available at reasonable rates.

review_399004244,“An Amazing and Fun Day in Universal Studios”,"Ok, so first and foremost, this is a review of my visit couple of months back to Universal Studios Singapore.First thing you see before entering the world of Universal Studios is the Universal symbolic globe which you can't miss to take a picture with. It was a Saturday when I decided to go for some exciting and thrilled ride in Universal Studios. It started out a little easy as you enter the place, you can see some universal characters as you enter a street which looks just like in some movies. There are different characters coming at different time of the day, greeting and entertaining the crowd.So would need to check the timings of your fav. character performing at various location within the studios.As you further come down, you have two options to choose either you can go right or left, basically it doesn't matter as you would like to visit and have experience of everything. For me I decided to go left and start with some of the Madagascar folks, luckily there was a show outside as I arrived wherein the characters from the movie performed to songs, but for me it was King Julien who stole the show with his moves on his trademark song ""I like to move it"", it was a great start for me. Then went to a water ride on the Madagascar section, the ride was nice and slow, and entertaining.I then moved to the next set which was of Shrek, first was the 4D experience of a short video clipping, never experienced anything like that before, it was really an eye opener on the ways an a cinema can be experienced. After coming out of the cinema I came across the Far Far Away Kingdom Palace, it was huge and majestic, really wonderful.Then I moved further to the ""Water World"", it was a replica of the movie set, wherein actors enacted the final fight scene from the movie, with all the fireworks and pyrotechnics. it was really cool.Further moved, to the ""Mummy Returns"" section, boy let me tell you this was one of the rides had lot of fun. In the beginning it seems like a normal roller coaster ride, but as it starts you can feel the fun and excitement sinking within you. The ride is like a underground mine ride, you are taken in to get you a glimpse of the movie through this ride. The ride goes back and forth as you are chased by the mummies. I would recommend for you to definitely try it out.Later, went to Jurassic World, but had to skip it due to the long queue, but took some pics of the robotic dinosaur which was outside and it did looked like a freaking real dinosaur, scary !!!Finally, it was the ride I had the most awesome experience ""Transformers"". I didn't planned on keeping it the last, I never knew at the beginning that I should have not kept this for the very last. I went in the transformers section, stood in the queue for the ride and to my amazement the queue was so HUGE. One might think the queue ends as you enter the building, but no that's just the start. It took me nearly an hour and a half till I actually was on the ride, it was all worth it though. WOW !!! is the first thing comes into my mind just after few seconds it starts. The whole ride is about you actually experiencing that you are in a Transformer movie. I don't know whether we call it a 4D, 5D, 7D or any other dimensional view for it, but GOD it was one amazing experience. I was so amazed by the ride that I wanted to go for another round, but since I already took so much time in the queue for the ride, it was closing time.I personally couldn't manage to complete all of the rides in one day, so would advice if you have time and won't mind spending a bit of money then probably should take a 2 day ticket, so in that way you could easily go through all of the rides and enjoy it as much as you can, it is worth it.Just a bit of an advice, if you planning to go to the studios on a Saturday, then take a note that it closes early than the usual timing on a Saturday. So would better get down there early, but might as well try and go there on a weekday, because on weekends it is more crowded. Also, do check on the weather before heading down there, if it rains or is a thunderstorm, most of the rides are closed. I had a first hand experience of this, it rained half way through the day when I was there and most of the rides where closed and because of which the two rides which are sheltered got busy and had massive queue. So do take time to check the weather, to decide on your visit to Universal Studios.In all it was a wonderful first experience of the place and would surely go back on my next visit.Enjoy your day in Universal Studios

review_398755814,“Good but small park”,"Comparing it to other Universal Studio / Dianey parks, it is much smaller.Visited on a Thursday, park wasn't too full.Bought tickets online (S$60 instead of S$74).Strongly recommend to get there early, be at the Sentosa expreaa station at 0930, buy a ticket for the tram at the machine (S$4, crefit card only) to reach the park by 10, when it opens.Queues were short until 1100 and after 1800. Around 1300-1600 queues for the major rides where 1-2 hours.It rained heavily at 1100, thankfully I had a pair of flip flopa to chabge to. Strongly recommend to bring flip flops + a change of cloths!Transformers and Shrek 4D were nice.The mummy ride was quite good.Human and Cyclon had huge lines (didnt try them).Water world performance was very good!Park was clean, prices inside were reasonable (for a theme park..).Strongest point of the park was decorations. Each of the 7 zones has a unique theme with a lot of small and fun details.If you are looking for a theme park in SG - you should go.If you have other options at Europe / USA - they will probably be better.

We went via MRT, then walked straight over the footbridge ( zero cost ) which has Travelators almost the entire length. We paid at the gate $70 each + 4 X $50 express pass which we rotated around depending on the ride. So worth it walking straight to the front of the line, but remember you can only use the pass once on each ride. All the rides were great, but I thought the Transformers was one of the best rides ever! Super cool. Shrek show is the same as at Movie World Gold Coast. The water world show at 5 pm was good. Food is reasonably priced. The park is not too big so easy on the legs for the day.

review_398384628,“Not well kept; not for small toddlers. ”,"My family was disappointed with this park (mom/dad/2 year old). Our view may be biased because we just visited Tokyo Disney last week, but, I think we'd be disappointed no matter what. Our two year old is short (82cm), and she couldn't go on half the rides. The ones that she could go on we're extremely mediocre. The rides show plenty of wear and are run down. Parts of every attraction weren't working. One ride even broke down on us. They seem to be extremely understaffed; getting on each ride was a free-for-all. They don't always offer the ""single rider"" option they claim to offer (which is miserable when you're alternating rides with your spouse). Bathrooms are hard to find.We spent 3 hours in this park and then left. Honestly, I wish we hadn't come. Don't waste your time in Singapore, go to the Zoo.

review_398261027,“Best theme park in Singapore”,"Second visit to the park, last time was 5 years ago which not many attractions were established. This time, kids (8 y.o.) can play most of the rides already.Express pass (one per attraction) is a must if you plan to take all the rides within one day. Worth the extra bucks. There is another type of pass for unlimited rides for all, but for us; one per attraction is good enough.Got there around 10am. Take a left after the main street, takes the rides, one by one, sit in for shows, or take pictures with the Mascot, we almost finish all rides by 5pm. Then went to the Stunt show near the entrance, a must see.The 4D Transformer almost made me puked. For Roller Coaster, the HUMAN is weaker than the CYLON. Trust me, don't do the Cylon if you have a faint heart. These new Roller coasters didn't have those slow uphill conveyor belt, they just shoot you up and roll.....

review_398153091,“A worthwhile place to visit”,"This was our second visit to universal studios. Our first was when it opened and a few attractions weren't finished so it was great to go back and see everything finished .The park is worthy of its title and is definitely as good as Americas version..We went as a family of 4 for our sons 13th birthday and everyone loved it .Our favourite rides were the mummy and the Jurassic park. Also eating lunch in the Jurassic park restaurant was so authentic we felt like we were in the movie .We did find however less characters roamin around to meet and greet the people which was disappointing from our first visit and also when the park closed there were no characters around bidding us farewell like they did on our first visit . I just felt like there was no love left within the park itself.However if given the chance I would definitely go there again and again. It's a busy day trying to see everything but it can be done in one day. Use your map so you don't waste time wondering where things are. Be prepared for expensive park food and if it's a hot day bring a water bottle each.We also hired a locker which was handy when we all wanted to go on rides together and they were reasonably priced.The water world show is a must it has a really unexpected spectacular ending which will have you gasping.And if you are hot go for the Jurassic park ride I can guarantee you'll be soaked when your done. Overall a worthy place to visit.Enjoy

review_398053760,“Awesomeness ”,"Omg, I can spend three days there, so much fun, festivity and fun rides. Lots to see and do. Suitable for all ages, kids would love it there as they have most cartoon characters like shark and Fiona , puss in boots, Jurassic world, transformer rides, alien stations, ancient Egypt (the scariest ride I've ever been on, but such an adrenalin rush), this is to name a few things to do. Definitely worth a visit or three. Good tip, join the universal club, entrance fee is 75 Singapore dollars a person normally , but with the club card, it costs 150 Singapore dollars which gives two entries plus you get a 30 Singapore dollar meal voucher to use in universal studios or any where on Sentosa island. A real bargain. The card is valid for a year, and ever time you shop, you earn points. Another tip, if your time is limited in Singapore, do universal studios and maybe aquarium one day and the rest of the island another day. The cable car is a good experience to get into the park, but quite expensive, on our second day, we took a taxi straight there and it cost 20 dollars instead of 66 dollars for the cable car.

review_398007801,“Not the most exciting park experience!”,"It's a rather belated review as I had travelled to Universal November 2015. I had travelled with my two daughters both over 12. It was peak holiday season and though we had gone on a weak day the park was quite packed. We already had the Viator pass so didn't need to line up for the tickets but to save time on long queues we decided to get the express pass. The price for it mentioned online was different from what we paid that day- almost double! When I mentioned to them of the rates given online they mentioned that the rates are dynamic and goes by demand and supply. I think that's quite a sham. But we didn't have an option as we had to finish the park in a day so hesitantly paid up. Since the park shuts quite early in the day around 7 pm even with the fast track pass we just about managed to do the major rides and shows, not all though. ( I must admit we started the park late around 10.30 am so that was one of the reasons we had to hurry up for completion of rides. So start early as soon as the park opens up.)Though my kids enjoyed the coasters and other thrilling rides but still they thought it could have been more exciting. If you go with great expectations you would be disappointed. Or if you have already been to theme parks in the U.S. Or Europe, then you may not be that thrilled. That said the park is made very well and have good facilities like lockers, food, shopping etc but they all come with a price. There are lockers next to almost all the rides where you could keep your stuff. Or you could rent locker for the whole day at a nominal price. All said and done it was quite an expensive and tiring day, not worth the price.

review_397945204,“Day out during grandchildren's visit to SGP”,"There is no doubt that US is a huge draw for the crowds. Could RWS be granted more land to allow for an extension and more rides? A debate for another day. There are rides for the young 2+ and old 80+. This was out first visit since the intertwined battlestar gallactica rides Humanoid (red) and or vs. Cyclon (blue) had reopened. To be honest the whole attraction is quite lame without these two rides. There are now about 10 - 12 rides with four or five having a ""scream"" factor (Mummy, dragon, transformers and the Two BGs already mentioned). There are performers aplenty, who sing and dance and run about scaring people then stopping for the photo opportunities that are soooo needed in Asia. Food and beverage outlets cater to western and Asian tastes. Toilets are close at hand and are of a high standard. One note of warning. The queues for the top rides can grow to more than an hour between 1045 and 1530. Unless you are and early starter and/or late finisher, it may be worth investing in a limited (one shorter queue per 14 attractions) or unlimited express pass (SGD50 and 70 respectively). There is shade and plenty of areas to sit or cool down but it can be hot in the sun due to the concrete and architecture.

It will probably be more suitable for older children and teenagers who like exciting rides. My girls only enjoyed the merry go round and the 4D shriek movie. The rest of the attractions are either they cant go in due to height constraint or for those that they can play, they dont quite enjoy it. For adults, it is meant for those who like such exciting rides.

review_397437987,“Must Do”,"I love theme parks and Universal Singapore did not disappoint. I really recommend everyone to visit, but do some planning around your visit though as it can be done in one day if you pay the extra for a Fast Pass. We went at the end of April and the park was really busy and we made it to all major attractions [barring a 2 small attractions like the how movies are made and the attraction that's like Twister from the Orland US which I had seen already] and had about 45 minutes to shop around for the children. We got to the theme park around 30 min after it opened and had no queue to get in as we had bought our tickets online. I do suggest to buy online as there was a Mastercard discount of 10% that is running. The one setup back is that I also bought the fast-pass tickets online and that was a little bit of a challenge as you have to keep your printed ticket with you for the entire time as at each attraction they mark it off - I assumed they would give us some kind of arm band. Keep this in mind as you need to keep it either in a wallet or bag so that it doesn't get damaged. We bought the normal fast pass which allows for only a single use fast pass [and not unlimited]; we felt this was adaquate as we had no intention on riding any rides more than once. The rollercoasters are the only time you will encounter a long line, we waited for approx 20 min with our fast pass tickets for the Human rollercoaster and about 15 min for Cylone. All the other lines were approx 5 min to wait with the fast pass tickets. For the Puss in Boots adventure, it might be better to use the single rider queue as the ride has 3 seats in a row and thus this queue sometimes moves faster. My only other suggestion when moving through the park is to ""go right"" through Sci-Fi City, do the transformers and then the big coasters. Then back track a bit to ""go left"" starting with Madagascar. The park is circular so this is what we did and we ended at the Mummy. I found this to be easy and I felt we had fewer lines at the attractions. Dining: I cannot comment here as we just had a snack in the park of pizza and a few beers. There were lots of of options though of Asian, Indian and Western. We had a good dinner in Resorts World outside the actual park.

review_397293541,“An expensive disappointment ”,"We went to Universal studios Singapore for 1 day. We were first met with a hefty sum of about 74 SGD per person, hurts in the wallet for a student. Anyway, after the entry fee we were expecting alot, but we were quickly disapointed. Altough i have give props to Universals studios Singapore for the park design. It was very atmospheric and can be enjoyed by kids aswells as grown ups, a simpel walk around the park just looking was fun. Although the disappointment started when you were looking at the rides. First of there were very few of them, under 15. And all of them had 30 mins + queue times, most of the popular rides which we were looking at were up to 60-90 mins queue. We queued for 60 mins and got little joy out of the 5 min ride. Merch was cramped in every possible location with their logo printed over every thing, nothing was to exciting. Although kids would probably love it. Food inside was decent, the atompsheric restaurants sure looked appealing but the food didn't live up to the expectations. PS: We met a couple from Japan who had been to both universal studios Los Angels & Japan. They told us that Singapore was a disappointment in both size and enjoyment compered to the others. Could be good to keep that in mind if you have high expectations and been to the others.Positive: Atmosperhic, Good for families with kids, good facilites, Free wi-fi in the entire park Negative: Looong queue times(got lower towards the end of the day), expensive for what you get, a bit smallUniversal studios Singapore is good for families, kids would love it. Waiting is part of the game in these amusment parks. But for us it wasnt out most enjoyable day in Singapore.

This first time i went with my family, Second time was with my friends and this time with my wife. Well, its very romantic. New attractions such as the puss in boots roller coaster is great. It is still clean from a few years that i went there. There is still a few weeks till soak out even finishes where there is a wet party and you will see your favorite characters walking about such as the minions, cookie monsters and cast from sesame streets. Even the concert event which was the monster rock has changed to sesame streets. I am gonna still be visiting universal studios in the future. It is easy to get here with just an mrt, or i used the singapore cable car. Besides the universal studios are tons of other places to visit.

review_396988923,“a very sorry place....”,"Singapore is well known for many attractions - most top quality - an excellent experience coupled with a fair value. Started on the Madagascar ride. Once boarding a boat - I was told to take my cap off and put down the safety bar. Fast ride? big drops? few bumps? Non of the above. Almost impossible for a cap to come off, and the safety bar - must have saved my life as I did manage not to be captured. As for the park - they fail to mention it's probably the least clean place in all of Singapore. Streets, sidewalks and especially cafes filled places not to put your feet. Table tops - at the one place we did stop - gross. As for value - that's a personal decision. The children I went with while bored much of the time - did manage to have some fun. Fast Pass is a must.... for those who can afford it.

review_396626139,“Get the Express Pass”,"My advice to anyone visiting is to plan ahead on which rides you are most keen on and plan when you are going to visit. Rides like Transformers and Revenge of the Mummy are going to have looong waiting times. We spent 60 min in line waiting for Transformers at 2 pm however when we passed by later at 7.30, the waiting time was only 5 min. So, that's something to consider. (This was on a Monday, so I can only imagine what it must be on a weekend). You could do the 'kiddie' rides first like those in Madagascar and Far Far Away and then head to Lost World and Sci Fi City. Some rides are extremely childish though, so again, plan ahead. We waited 40 min to go on Treasure Hunters and that was so disappointing I can't even put it in words! If you can afford it, take the Express Pass. Waiting in these long lines, takes away some of the fun and its extremely frustrating seeing the Express Pass people waltz to the front of the line.Food inside is surprisingly not as expensive as anticipated and there's a good variety so we were pretty pleased with that. There's an Indian restaurant in the Ancient Egypt section.

I went there on Thursday and still i got to queue for 1 hour for Jurrasic Park ride which is the ride is just like less than 10 minutes.Another tips is, go queue there before the open gate (10am), so you could go in faster. After you in, go to the popular rides first (Transformer, The Mummy, Jurrasic Park), because when its still morning, the rides wont be too crowded. Dont take a picture or go to shops first. You can do that later after you take all the popular rides.

review_396569693,“Must go place when you are in Singapore”,"It is a different world all together. A world of movies and cartoons! You be at this place and suddenly you start feeling that you are also part of the reel world. You get to see all the famous characters like Charlie chaplin, Minions, Shrek, Cleopatra, Puss in the boots etc. etc. Would suggest anyone planning to visit the place to get there as early as possible ( I think it starts at around 9 am).One day can be easily spent at this place. The studio is divided in different zones - Transformers world, Egyptian World, Jurrasic Park, Fairytale world and so on. Mine and my family's personal favourites were Transformers and Jurrasic Park. The must try ride there is the immersive 3D transformer ride, where you get a chance to feel as a part of the transformer movie. It is just awesome. The other one was the Jurrasic PArk ride, where you go in a group on a boat, fall from a waterfall and flow through a river stream surrounded by different sorts of dinosaurs. While you visit all the places and rides, there are also several theatres, where shows go on. My suggestion is - pick your show wisely, as every minute spent is precious. You for sure don't want to get stuck in a boring show just to realize later that you are out of time and missed out on an awesome ride. (e.g. there is one talking donkey show, pls avoid it if it is still there). The studio closes at sharp 6.30 pm. so plan accordingly. Have a fun gala time and don't forget to take loads of pics with your favourite characters and settings. :)

The Transformers ride was phenomenal, and really well planned, designed and run! The ""meet & greet"" with Optimus and Bumble Bee was really out of this world, almost magical. Yes, I know they are not real, but for that moment all of it felt real and magical. The Sesame Street Show, was as much as fun! really enjoyed it, and the after-show outside the theatre was a lot of fun. Loved meeting the Minions, the themes within the park are well made, and really enjoyable. There are plenty of shops to spend more money on merchandise :) and food as well!The roller-coasts looked like a lot of fun based on all the screams I heard:P, but that's as close as I got to it :)The Shrek, Donkey, Puss and Boots, Madagascar themed plays, rides and meet and greets were quite nice as well, even for us adults. The Jurassic Park theme was quite cool, and the ride was almost too real :) The Lost Kingdom (return of the Mummy ride etc), we couldn't visit because it was difficult with small children. But looked fun!All in all, I can't wait to go back :) spent the whole day there and didn't feel the time go at all!Important note: If you don't want to wait in long queues (sometimes waiting time for rides are as much as 45 mins), please do yourself a favor and buy the ""Express Pass"" along with your entrance ticket. This definitely made the difference, as we didn't spend more than 10 minutes for any rides waiting. Also the meet and greet are only for a short time (max 15 mins) and at scheduled times each day. So plan your rides accordingly if you don't want to miss any of the meet and greets!

Rollercoaster has a lot of fans.. Of course you should try it.. If you have normal ticket, Cylon ride is better.. I would recommend Transformers and Battlestar Galactica in Sci-Fi City Zone, Revenge of the Mummy in Ancient Egypt Zone, and Amber Rock Climb in Lost World.. The other is your choice.. Foods and drinks are quite expensive so you can figure something out like treat your belly well before arrive at the USS and bring some water with you.. Enjoy your time!

Dont forget to bring your water container just incase you are thirsty, because you can refill it inside. Suggestion for this theme park.

review_394932854,“Get your tix for HALLOWEEN NIGHTS!!!”,"The only reason I go to USS is to satisfy my hunger for the macabre: Their annual scare fest during Halloween. I must say lat year they really top themselves with 4 brilliant haunted houses ~ Haunted MRT (with simulated motion), Siloso Gateway Block 50 (a haunted HDB with zombies apocalypse), Hell House (with scorching temperature of Hell) and Tunnel People (can literally smell the damp earth and feel the moist surface). All so marvellously done that I couldn't select a fave. The 3 scare zones was also wonderfully executed.Compared to 2014 which was mediocre, and 2013 which was much better than 2014. I am so looking forward to this year's and I'm praying that USS will push its buttons to the limit to try and scare the socks off my feet!I highly recommend purchasing the Express Pass to shorter queues. For this highly anticipated event, many will bound to buy the Express Pass but it still make queuing shorter compared to Normal Pass.

review_394923673,“Short Holiday break”,"This is my 2nd visit to Universal Studio Singapore and I must say I am really disappointed. My first visit was filled with surprises, dressed characters going around and engaging with people, etc. This time, there was only one - Frankenstein and that was it! The place looks seriously short of staff and there was no proper control of the crowd which to me can be really dangerous as this is a kids playground as well. To highlight what I meant . We queued up for a good two hours to play the water-raft. That was fine, what was not fine was that when we got onto the float, the staff made what I called cursory checks on whether all of us were properly belted up. The aunty next to us had so many stuff with, a couple of bags including a bag-pack, I wonder how she was allowed to get on in the first place. To make matters worse, the staff checking on the safety belts, just shouted - make sure you put on your safety belt without personally inspecting everybody! This aunty did not put on her belt and when we asked her to, she says no need, I am alright! What if she gets flung off her the float? Who is to blame? The air cond was also really bad even in the food court. The only place enjoyable unsurprisingly is the place where they sell the souvenirs! I am seriously doubtful, I will come to this theme park again in the future.

The Halloween show every year also sets the mood for the macabre and shows the sundown side of the park. I have not gathered the guts yet to go on the Battlestar Galectica ride (cos I will lose said guts). My fave is the Mummy Ride, which thrills more than the one in the USA. Did the cheesy tourist shots with the characters - Puss in Boots being my fave cavalier! The lines and waits are of course irritating but it is so worth it. Go early, preferably on a weekday and not furig the school holidays. Great food available in the park too.

review_394577988,"“Expensive day, but fun...”","Singapore's Universal Studio was a bit of a mix for us. We decided to go all out and get the $70 each extra (on top of ticket prices) for the unlimited express rides pass. Figuring we would not be doing this again for a long time. There are several rides not included in this, which personally annoyed me considering the cost, but as it was they were aimed at the younger kids anyway. If we had not got these the lines were a minimum of 40 minutes per ride. The food court we went to was not great and very expensive for what we got. On whole however the kids and my hubby had a great day, going on rides multiple times with only a few minutes to line up. Teenagers will love this place!!!! We finished our day off with an exorbitant costly ride on the cable car back to the main land.... But once again, how often will you do this? I can recommended this to any adrenalin junkies who enjoy fast rides. If you are like me and don't.... Do not trust your husband and kids when they tell you it's a tame ride!!! Spend the entire day there and enjoy it for what it is.

review_394181250,“Pretty crowded but we had fun”,"We choose to visit the studio on Monday as we are expecting less people. However, our expectation and reality did not match start from the entrance long queue around 20 minutes. But we are still ok as the impression of the studio is pretty amazing. As soon as we got inside, we would like to try the Transformer Ride and start the queue. However, when we reach in the middle, they announced that the waiting time will last 1:30 hrs. We was astonishing and couldn't believe the situation. Of course, it really did takes 1:30 hrs just for around 2 minutes ride. Another amazing rides are Revenge of the Mummy, Cyclon and Human. Because of long queue in every amazing, we did not have much fun in this amazing place. We also did not have enough time for Far Far Away, Madagascar, and The Lost World. I assumed that it is not worthy for nearly 70 $ not including the food. In Bangkok, like Dream World, Siam Park City, I had more fun riding a lot of roller coasters all day and the ticket fees is more cheap. Not crowed this much also. I think the management team should arrange new plan to meet the demand of the customer or limit the capacity each day so that every visitor can enjoy the real fun of the studioMy friends even change the name Queversal Studio :)

While these did not work as well as in Orlando, they still saved a lot of time. Even with Express Pass, the wait times for the Battlestar Galactica coasters were still north of 30 minutes each.The theming of the lands is fantastic and completely immersive, Far Far Away is of particular note. The variations of the attractions from what can be found in the US theme parks was also appreciated. Even though the name was the same for Jurassic Park, it was a pleasant surprise what the ride turned out to be.Using the Express Pass allowed me to complete the park with the half day I had. I was also able walk around and take pictures shortly after park close before exiting the park.Overall I enjoyed Universal Studios Singapore and would return in the future with more time to fully explore the theming and shops of the park.

Waiting time for boring attractions (like a slow ride for kids) ranges between 30 and 60 minutes, and for anything even slightly exciting about 90 minutes. The Battlestar Galactica roller coaster makes you wait 180 minutes. Yes, that's a whopping three hours. Waiting in the heat, for a single roller coaster ride. I guess I finally found out Universal Studios' business model. First charge 75$ entrance fee, don't deliver anything, just to make people buy the Express pass.Fraud, if you ask me. Plain and simple.

As usual transformer ride (F4) was the first one but took 90 minutes in the Que, then two roller coasters took 90 minutes .Moved to Jurassic river adventure and Revenge of mummy. We liked revenge of mummy and it was thrilling and more adventurous than transformer ride. After 6pm we found there is no que for rides so we repeated some of them F1,F2,f3 and F4 in transformers and revenge of mummy, Jurassic river 2 to 3 times.Good thing: Good food . Halal food available. Prayer area available.Staff is much friendly and helping type. Negative: Should be better method of crowd management. For example if there is long line in transformer ride then some of them can be advised to go for other rides such as revenge of mummy, Jurassic river ride etc.Overall experience ..not as great as Universal studio Orlando.It was bright sunny day but OK for rainy day also

review_393374873,“Great fun!”,"We have previously been to Universal Studios in Hollywood and the Singapore version was great. For Australian travelers it is most similar to Movieworld on the Gold Coast. Rides were a good mix for all ages, wait times averaged an hour plus so we bought a fast pass (note the fast pass allows one use per ride not unlimited uses). Food options good. All up a great day/night.

review_393317300,“Kids enjoyed it”,"We have been to the LA Universal and if you have been here the Singapore one will be a little on the boring side. It is a theme park and my kids did have a ball here and my daughter did not want to leave. I thought it was very small but obviously Singapore doesn't have the land for a huge theme park. My kids enjoyed all the rides and we purchased the front of the line ride pass for them so they could have plenty of rides. If you can afford to do this and your kids love rides then I would otherwise there can be long waits for the rides. Try and pick a cooler day to attend as it gets very very hot and can be quite draining. We also found that by the afternoon about 3pm the crowds had disappeared and the wait times for the rides was only about 5 to 10 mins. Not sure if this happens everyday but it did when we were there. Take plenty of water. There are bubblers there though

review_393179234,“Overrated and overpriced. ”,"This park lacks the variety or quantity of rides that would justify the admission fee. There was nothing throughout the day that made us feel like we had value for money. Especially not the 'fireworks show' that we were told would be worth waiting around for, and would last 'around fifteen minutes' (though it actually lasted five minutes).The fast track queuing system was not consistent from ride to ride, or when members of staff switched roles to direct riders to the boarding areas. When one of the rides was shut down due to the weather, there were groups of people who were just allowed to queue jump, as we were given the option to stay or leave. The waiting times were not anywhere near reflective in reality, partly due to the mismanagement of priority customers. On one ride we waited over two hours, despite the time stated being 40 minutes.Later on towards the end of the day, there was the opposite problem, with signs saying 50 minutes but then only took about 10 minutes.It just didn't feel like you were in a top class facility throughout the day, around the world there are many superior venues - but I guess not so much in Singapore!

review_393162929,“Horrific management of queues - terrible customer service - do not go here with young children.”,"I went to Universal Studios on Friday 15th July with my five year old and seven year old daughters. It was raining so most of the rides were closed which meant that there were only a few rides and shows open. We went on the Madagascar ride firstly which we queued a while for but was ok and organized. Secondly we queued for the Shrek show in the Palace and this is when it all went horribly wrong. We queued patiently in a long line in the dark and people started pushing and shoving forward... all ok until the queue broke and we were all unleashed into a dark waiting area before the performance room... there was no order and there was lots of pushing and shoving. My girls were being knocked about and grown men were being pushed right up against us. Just when we thought the doors to the show were about to open another door opened and a stream of people from a totally different waiting area were let in.. literally 100 of them. The mood in our particular room became almost desperate and panicky. Finally the rope was lifted and everyone just ran for it with no order. The universal studios rep had no control really. We finally got into the stadium and by that state we were so panicky that we ran out of the fire exit and ended up outside by the some bins where a lovely cleaner calmed us down. We never saw the show and it was a petrifying experience. The girls and I went to the fairy shop and one more very gentle ride before going to guest services where clearly I was crying and in shock. They said no money back and gave us universal studio mugs for our trouble... Seriously terrible. I wasn't in a state of mind to argue so asked them please to work it out as we needed to go back to the safety of our hotel to calm down. I gave them hotel Shangri La Sentosa and room number and they never got back to us. I also e-mailed them and again nothing. I simply can not believe their lack of care. Somebody will get hurt in the queues and they seriously need to look into customer service. Perhaps they believe they are a big company so can get away with it.

review_393142169,“The best place to spend a day”,"We planned to go to Universal before we came, were very excited for that. It was a big place with so many games that you could spend a whole day long. We started with Transformer game, then Dragon fly, then the revenge of Mummy...it was a long queu even we came on Monday. The advice for you is getting a map and decide to choose games first, because you cant join all of them. We got a good day out. Will do it again if have chance.

review_393128317,“2nd visit a lot busier”,"Having visited this park 5 years ago we were excited to rein-act the same awesome day we had previously had. A couple of mistakes on our behalf added to us not living the dream on the day of our visit. This trip we decided to take the MRT to Vivo city & catch the monorail whereas last visit we took a taxi direct to entrance. Arriving at Vivo city we encountered a huge number of people joining us for USS. The first part of our day in joining a lengthy queue. We had purchased the standard tickets based on our previous trip where the express ticket was not necessary. This time we encountered waiting times of 2 hours! In the end after doing a few of the shows we decided to leave the park & did the Segway later returning for rides - still with a wait time of 45 mins for the popular rides. It was very clear that on this day it would have been a wise move to purchase the express ticket- at least for our teens. If you have not done the park I still think it is a good day out but unless you want to spend much of your day queuing- I would suggest the express tickets. Head straight to the rear of the park & do rollercoasters & Transformer rides 1st. The American diner had good food- pizza, soup & drink value meal that was delicious.

We are booked from Wendy Tickets at concessional rates. Getting there was also very convenient by the Sentosa Express monorail. Of all the rides, those we liked most are Transformers, Cylone (be at the front row) and Jurassic Park among others. Plenty of food options around. Each ride had a Q of 30-45 mins. This took most of the time. There is a premium ticket option available which was not known to us. This wud hv helped us save a lot of time as there is no Q for that.

We started with the Minions before proceeding to the Transformers , Madagascar, Puss in boots Jurassic Park , the Mummy Dragon and other Roller. Coasters , Shrek and Sesame Street . The rides. Can be enjoyed by Children and adults alike . The express pas meant that we didn't have to wait in long queues . There was free wifi and many points . There were ample food places as well to suit everyone .

review_393074680,“Go early or leave Late to beat the queues”,"This Universal studios is one of the smaller ones, so during peak season, expect long queues. If you have the money, buy the express passOne of the most fun rides for kids 7 years and up and adults is Canopy rider, Jurassic Park Rapids adventure. If you are heading for these rides, either be the first in the park or the last to leave, as that is when the queues start disappearing. For lunch, you can eat at Loui's NY Pizza Parlour, as you get a huge pizza, drinks and soup for the whole family. The package deal is quite affordable for the family.If you are on a tighter budget, exit the Park, and head for the Malaysian Food Street. If you want Western, head towards Mcdonalds, where the Golden Arches can always be counted on.

review_393050795,“Great day! ”,"This is a great park. As others have said Transformers is fantastic. We had the ultimate express pass & got on this 5 times during the day. The staff on this ride were super friendly, especially the guy on the entrance (15th July 8pm), as were all staff (except a grumpy snack restaurant manager by the lake). The express pass was worth every cent, but if you can't do it, the park gets much quieter between 6.30-8.30pm and wait times reduced to 5 mins for everything then. Food & drink are expensive. We left the park for an hour & went to Chillies in Sentosa instead but this was just as expensive ($70 for 2 burger meals & a side of mash) so I would suggest going to Mc Donald's instead which is a 2 minute walk from the park! If you bring a bottle, you can refill it from the water fountains, but I didn't like the taste of the water at all (I drink a lot of water & this has a strange after taste, so we poured it back out & paid the crazy money to buy some). One of the rides that you can't use express pass for is canopy flyer, which we returned to around 7pm & did twice as wait time was only 5 mins. This is an awesome ride and you can see the city lights from the top at night, which is wonderful. First time we went on it, we were allocated a backwards seat, so second time we asked for one that went forwards & this was much better. An excellent ride, v short but v enjoyable. I would definitely recommend the park and ultimate express pass for a great day out & would definitely return!

review_392937470,“Cool and Fun Holiday”,"I was reading some reviews about this first before we went to the park. But in real-life experience (the weather's bad, cloudy and rain since morning also humid) I thought no one's gonna go to the park (of course i was wrong - silly me), if you are late coming to the park like me, I found that the itinerary that worked for me and my family, will be like this:(Started at 10.30am)- Go to Jurrasic Park rapid adventure (1) and buy disposable poncho and go for the ride- Run to Waterworld, 30mins before it starts, wear your poncho and sit in soak seat area, you'll get great view and fun experience- Go to Transformer or the Mummy, whichever has shortest queing time, I will choose the Mummy (2) and return to the transformer on a later time, the waiting time for Transformer is shorter if you ride on the evening (0 mins)- Eat at Friar's or Goldilock at Far and Away area, you need to fuel up your stamina (and delicious too) then chills and relax by watching shrek adventure- go to Battlestar Galactica then ride for Human (3) (on my experience the waiting time on the afternoon 'only' 45 mins, but somehow I didn't have to wait at all)- Cooling down your brain first or just go to Cylon (4) for your next roller coaster experience- then go ride the Transformer (5) to wrap up your must-ride attractions- don't forget to see Lights, Camera, Action, for its amazing special-effect making- then choose any ride/show that you want to try, eventhough I didn't get all the rides, at least I have tried the 5 must-ride attractions on my list ^_^But next time, if I go in holiday time like this, I would probably save some money to buy the express pass

We were 4 adults and 3 kids ( important info , children below 4 years go free) , and there was not much for the kids of this age. Also in the US we took the front of the line pass and that came in handy , here there wer only 2-3 rides where we actually used this pass ,else most of the rides had short wait lines (we had gone on a weekday but during peak tourist season). SO if you are going on a weekday perhaps a usual ticket should be good enough . Also for people travelling with infants , there are a couple of feeding rooms , so that is helpful . Also there are multiple eating options ,overall a fun day.

Also, we went on a Sunday so couldn't have completed the park without express passes - expensive like how but life savers if u are out of days in the city! the themes are good and the live shows that keep happening are super fun (luvddd the donkey show and the Madagascar dance).

review_392735805,"“Wear sunscreen, deodorant, and go to ""Guest services""!”","It is a decent amusement park, but.... It is hot and humid in Singapore and feels even hotter at USS, especially after going indoors for some of the rides or shows, then going outdoors again. Even if it is cloudy or rainy, across a full day at USS you WILL get hot and sweaty - which is very evident when people get into the monorail or free bus at the end of the day! (It's actually quicker to take the bus back to Vivocity than the monorail). It is likely to be packed on any day that Singaporean kids are not at school (check scheduled school holidays and public holidays at the MOE website). The queues are long (even with the express pass, you may still have to wait 10-15 minutes). Even if the queue lines look to be under shade, it can still be hot in the queues and the late afternoon sun comes in at an angle and can still burn. Water fountains are mostly located in the queue lanes, so remember to fill up your water bottle at every chance! Don't expect to find free water anywhere near a food outlet! (Note: you CAN bring in your own food and drink- in plastic bottles - but don't make it look like a ""picnic"" - which is officially not allowed.) The most frustrating thing is trying to plan your day so that you can see the shows you want, in between waiting for your favourite rides (which will have the shortest queues in the first and last hours of the day): The show times are not indicated on the website, nor on the physical map you collect after entering the theme park. I suggest you go to Guest Services (on the left after you enter the turnstiles) and ask them to tell you the times and locations for shows like WaterWorld (a great stunt show - see photo), The Sesame Street Show, the various street entertainment shows, and Hollywood Dreams Parade and Lake Hollywood Spectacular (only shown on weekends and some public holidays). Good luck!

Our children are 9 and 6 (6 year old is tall for his age), 9 yo allowed on all the rides and the 6 yo all but two. He didn't mind though as it was getting towards the end of the day and he was tired. Get there early as there is a line to get in even if you have your tickets. The signs and literature say no food or drink and mandatory bag check, no one checked our bag and I saw tons of people with their own food. I probably still wouldn't have packed it because we didn't want to carry stuff around the food. We brought a change of clothes and stored it right away in the lockers. Pick up a map and a print out of the shows for the day. I got lucky in the sense that we stumbled upon the two shows I wanted to see. Waterworld - YES! We had a magicial fun filled day!

There are plenty of rides for people of all ages and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful if you have any questions.

We visited once on a Monday which is surprisingly more crowded compared to Saturday's we have been there. On Saturday we will arrive the park at around 1900hrs after my 4 year old's swim class. We like to come at this time because most of the visitors are done for the day so it means lesser or no waiting time at all. If you are lucky and the attendant is nice and the Q is not long you can ask if you can just ride again without re-queuing, but of course if you happen to see the Q is long please be courteous enough to Q again.Rides recommend for the not so adventurous toddlers: (note: there are other rides but O will concentrate on where we frequently go)1. King Julien's Beach Party-go-round is a family carousel. This is one of the our boy's fave. He can hop on to one Madagascar character to the other all night while the parents seat on the stationary seats.2. Dino SoarinYou can ride on the back of flying dinosaurs soaring up into the sky or plunging down into the shadows. There is a button which you have to press and HOLD so the dinousaur will fly high. Tip: Number 4 dinousaur is the best seat in this ride as there are no sudden drop feeling after you release the button to go down unlike 6 and 7. 3. Spaghetti Space ChaseThis a slow ride, inside is a bit dark. Can sit 4 in 1 cabin. This is a space mission for Elmo and Super Grover to stop a plot of stealing spaghetti from earth. Sometimes my son gets bored though.There are pram and wheelchair rental inside the park. Cardholders get a $5 off for the pram.Parade and Fireworks are only available on weekends. Tip: sit at the staircase near Marty's Casa del wild food court for an uninterrupted view. Be sure to be early as people start sitting 30mins before.It is also worth it to buy the souvenir bottle at $11 (I bought it with slushie) as you can refill it with a slushie at $5 or a softdrinks for $2. They clean the bottle for every refill.

review_392368517,“Excellent Day Out at Universal Studios Singapore”,"USS is definitely a great place to visit if you have a day free with nothing to do in Singapore. I spent the whole day there (10am-730pm) and managed to fill my time doing things. The park is pretty much designed for children and young adults, though there are a number of rides that adults will enjoy as below:1) the roller coasters - Human versus cyclon. Cyclon is by far the better option - and will give you the most exhilarating ride in the whole park. Human is a good warm up for Cyclon. Waiting times vary between 20-60 mins2) Transformers - The Ride - highly-recommended, a 4D experience not to be missed. Waiting times vary between 20-45 mins 3) Jurassic Park - Rapids Adventure - riding within a 9-rider raft/ boat through the rapids, more for children, only one plunge at the end of the ride worth any mention. This had the longest waiting time (up to 90 mins)4) Revenge of the Mummy - again it is a roller coaster with some riding in the dark - children will like them. Waiting time can be up to 40 mins Other interesting rides are generally for children - Madagascar Adventure, Canopy Ride at Jurassic Park, Shrek 4D experience, Puss in Boots, etc. I would suggest (if you can spare the cash) - fork out the extra SGD70 for unlimited express. This allows you to skip all queues (including one to enter USS!). The longest I waited with this pass was 15 minutes for the rapids - all the others I went right to the front of the line. Some rides are definitely worth exploring time and again (like Transformers and Cyclon) - so this pass comes in very handy. And rides become pretty empty towards the end of the day (between 5pm and 7pm) - so these are good times to explore the park and the rides. There are plenty of eateries within the park to choose from. There are lockers to store things as well.

I was really entertained like a child, I was able to experience ""The Mummy"" ride and I was totally freaked out because it was my first ever extreme ride experience. The Shrek show was nice to see, but the highlight was the Jurassic Park where I was extremely thrilled and entertained.

review_392202511,“Must visit!!”,"First suggestion would be take attest a 2 days pass. We planned it only for a day and wanted to do so much more. We had booked the tickets in advance so skipped the ticket queue. But there were long waiting queues for most of the rides. So we upgraded and got the express (skip the line) tickets, which definitely was worth it. We almost did all the rides, but couldn't manage some shows and activities. My little girl was super excited with the Shrek show. We all enjoyed the Transformers too. We were here specially to celebrate our girls's fifth birthday and she was super happy and excited with our surprise. A visit to this place is definitely worth it despite the long queues.We visited here in August 2013, but couldn't select this year option for my review.

review_392077398,"“Amazing, a must see!”","Being a Singaporean, I've been to the Universal Studios in Singapore many many times! I have also been to the Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. However as a personal opinion, I prefer the Universal Studios in Singapore over the Universal Studios in Orlando. The rides here in Singapore are really clean and thrilling. They also have rides that are meant for everyone, no matter what age. In general the queues are not very long if you visit on an off peak day, and there are many food options, no doubt expensive. The entire park is very clean and there are many facilities for disabled people as well. There are water coolers all around the park so getting drinkable water is really easy on a hot day! The locker system is really good as well, as you can ensure the safety of your belongings! I would really recommend visiting Universal Studios Singapore, whether you're a tourist or a local!

review_392058051,“Small but Fun!”,"Bought the tickets online through Klook for a significant discount. My partner and I went here on a Sunday. The place is so balanced in terms of distribution of themed attractions. If you fancy adrenaline rush, go ahead and enjoy the Battlestar Galactica. Make sure to ride the red one (Human) first before taking on the blue (Cyclone). Cyclone is the more intense ride. If you fancy a kiddie type of fun, there are many options available. The queue wasn't too bad. The longest wait we saw was 65 mins so we decided to just return when the crowd is thinner. Waterworld, Transformers, The Mummy, Battlestar Galactica and Lights Camera Action! are definite must tries. Make sure to keep yourself hydrated as the temperature can become a tad humid.

review_391937973,“Must visit - All age groups!”,"I have been to Universal Studios twice - With family (Parents) and then with friends (and a 3 year old child). Amazing place - Well thought and built likewise. They have all kind of rides - Simple non scary ones to full on roller coaster rides. If you have a child, I would advise wait and go, when the kid is more than 4 years old. That way, the child can go for rides, accompanying a parent. But for below 2-year-olds, they have these ""Minion"", ""Hollywood"", ""Shrek"" shows and all. - Plan your trip - It becomes highly crowded on weekends and public holidays. The wait time for that lines can go upto 120 Mins for major rides. - Buy the express ticket if you have the energy to cover the entire lot. The wait time will go up to 5 mins at the most (Recommended as the normal line is somewhere close to 50 to 120 mins) Do not buy express ticket for ppl who dont have plans to go for all rides. It will be a waste of money. - Restaurants at all zones, Snack counters, Clean washrooms, (Cold) Drinking water taps at all the lines, lockers at the rides to keep your stuff in, Prams available for tired toddlers at Far Far Away zone - Five stars for them! - Must go rides - Transformers, Mummy Ride, Shrek 4d, Cyclon roller coaster.

After lining up for two rides, we decided to go back to Guest Services (located near the front entrance when you come in) and paid $140 SGD extra on top of our admission price (we booked thru Klook.com for savings for attrctions- must check!). SO WORTH IT. Hate long lines and longest i waited for a ride was 15 mins (vs. ""50 mins"" but it seemed longer and way more hectic. We bought chicken strips in Jurassic Park which was good but id save your money and get a re-entry stamp and eat at the food court RIGHT next to the place. SO much cheaper and more delicious authentic Singaporean food court style food. You can easily finish the park its in a huge circle in about half a day.

review_391694246,“Express Pass is a disgrace”,"There are many positive comments about Universal Studios on Trip Advisor but I want to write my review on the Express Pass. In my opinion, this is a disgrace and the management who thought of this concept should be ashamed of themselves.I overheard one of the employees tell someone interested in the pass that the price of the pass changes daily dependant on the number of people expected. On the website, it states $30 for an express pass (limited) but on Monday 11th July, the price was $50. This ""express pass"" causes the long queues as the staff need to check the express passes to each person and then tick off the rides. The staff then allow approx 6 - 8 express pass people through before allowing the other patrons on. Without these passes, the lines would move far quicker. I'm quite frustrated that many of the trip advisor comments are ""make sure you buy the express pass"". Vote with you feet - stop buying this pass that is purely a money making machine to the management of Universal Studios who clearly have no morals.

Rides (specially transformer), shows, ambiance... everything is worth every single penny you spend. It will be as much enjoyed by couple as by a complete family. The moment you enter this place you will land into a different word. Not to miss the parade in the evening with all the characters... shrek.. fiona, donkey, Egyptian goddess (Anck-Su-Namun), optimum prime.. Gosh what an experience. You will find rides and shows for every member of your family. No second thought about whether to go or not, just go. Few words of advice 1)Start early so that you get to cover the whole park 2) Get an express pass along with the standard ticket.It is kind of a queue breaker pass and you don't have to wait in the queue for hours. In bad day you may have to wt. for hours to get in transformer ride. It may cost few extra bucks, but its worth it. 3)Avoid weekend or Singapore public holiday, it is overcrowded at that time and if you are without an express pass.Enjoy this place like one of a life time.

review_391621724,“Awesome day!!!”,"Purchase the Studio Express option when you buy your ticket. It is an additional $70 SGD on top of the ticket price (therefore it was $288 for 2 adults with the express option) but so worth it! There were lines that were 80 minutes long with the ordinary ticket, however with the Studio Express ticket the lines to these rides may have been 5 or 10 minutes. We went on rides 2 to 3 times when others with the ordinary tickets were still lining up for 1 ride. The food is very average, but you don't really go to these places for the food.

However one day is not enough for all the activities in Universal Studio, unless you have the Express pass ( price not known).The studio contains many themed zone like Hollywood, New York, Sci-Fi city, Egypt, Jurassic Park, Madagascar. Each zone contains different activities.Lots of activities like transformer autobots ride, roller coaster, revenge of mummy, jurassic park, shrek 4d show, lights,camera, action in hollywood section and many more. For every activity, enormous queues are there, especially in transformers, roller coaster and jurassic park rapids adventure, Canopy Flyer. There is a waterworld show you must see which is a live action performance that involves stunts on a stage that is set within a large pool of water.Get the guiding map and show timing leaflet at the entrance and plan accordingly, else you may miss some activity. Get a Express pass to avoid the queues. The entry ticket is SGD 74, but you may check some online stores like klook.com to get the tickets cheaper. Food is not allowed to be taken inside the studio, owever you can take small biscuit packets and small water bottles. There are many food points but are too costly. Also not much options for vegans. Drinking water fountains are installed in almost each zones.Overall its a great experience.

Shortest queues are half hour and this is on a Tuesday non school holiday period. A half hr wait time really means you are waiting minimum 40 minutes because there is an express line. Waste of money if you don't have an express ticket because you wait in the line for ages and then Anyone walking through the express line just pushes in.. No waiting for them! Plus the heat just makes you exhausted by midday when you might have finally went on 2 rides!!! Hated the experience and would not recommend it for anyone. The 20 attraction fun pass on Sentosa is a much better buy! Comfortable, fun and nooo queues!!

review_391274519,“A great day out for young and old!”,"Ok,so it's Universal Studios in Singapore. So firstly, it's gonna cost you to get in the gate. Add the express pass onto your ticket price because who wants to stand in line all day for rides? So it's worth it in that regard. But it doubles the ticket price for adults and more than doubles it for the kids. Make sure you understand that it doesn't cover ALL rides so there are a few that you can't skip the queue. Luckily it's not the major rides, but still annoying given that you have paid above and beyond so you don't have to wait in line. So if you can get over that (S$536 for a family of 4 to walk through the front gates) - then you're gonna have a great day! It lives up to it's name - the kids and adults alike loved it. The rides are great - Transformers is a MUST DO..! As is the Galactica & the Typhoon.... the little kids are well looked after with rides as well - these are also fun for the adults. Lots of food options so look around, download the park map before you go to plan your day.

review_391251808,"“Crowded, Long wait in queues”","We visited Universal Studios mid-week in early July 2016. We arrived at 9:25 am and queued up to purchase entry tickets for the 10:00 am opening. The tickets are priced at S$74 adult, S$56 (child 2-12 years) and S$36 senior (60 years plus). We were able to get a discount of 10% on tickets as we had The Map of Singapore which has an advertisement for 10% off to Universal Studios for holders of foreign passports. We had the opportunity to purchase express tickets at an additional cost of S$60 per ticket – but declined. We had arrived early and thought that we could manage to get round most of the rides before the crowds arrived later. We were quite mistaken! The actual gates to the park opened at 9:50 am and we were one of the first in and raced off to the Transformers ride. We were told that the wait would only be twenty minutes. No way – it was actually 55 minutes long in the queue with others and the ride only lasted a few minutes. It was then off to Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure which is a ride on a doughnut shape across water where you may get wet or splashed and see a few dinosaurs. Again, long queues and waiting times. The express ticket holders queue still requires a wait, but probably half the time. There are lots of crowds about and it is fairly easy to lose someone. Food and drink stalls are over-priced and only take cash – Not Visa or American Express credit cards. There is a bag check at the front entrance gate to Universal Studios and you are not allowed to bring in any food or drink. It was a very hot day and it was also difficult to find places to actually sit down. There are drinking water fountains about and we used this to fill up our own water bottles. We were at Universal Studios until late afternoon.

review_391195266,“Always a great day out”,"Overall this is a good theme park. It has a good mix of rides for all ages, and a couple of white knuckle rides to keep the enthusiasts happy. I would say that this is a must visit on the Singapore tourist trail. Couple of tips. First is to get there early. If you get there at 10 for the opening you usually get a relatively quiet hour before it starts to get busy. Then, take it easy in the middle of the day and pace yourself. Then plan to stay late as the park gets quiet again after about 5pm. The queues for the rides do get quite long. If you can I would really recommend the Express Unlimited pass. Whilst it doubles the cost of admission it can be really worth it. The cost per ride will end up being less than not buying it. For example. The queue for the Jurassic Park ride was 45 minutes. But only 5 minutes in the Express queue. That is some saving!

review_391045676,“Top 5 tips and tricks. ”,"1. Use an universal express pass It's really usefull because you dont have to wait 1-2 hours to play an attraction. But it might became more expensive because you have to pay 60 dollars more. But trust me its worth to use.2. Single ride is very useful  If you dont want spent more money to buy an express pass. Well, you should try to play an attraction by yourself or single ride. Because its very helpful and you just have to wait 30-45 minutes. But it's also depends what kind of game do you play. 3. Earlier easier  If you come sooner you might can play attraction without waiting. And the first thing you should do is play the transformers ride and battlestar cyclone (because it'll very crowded and you could wait for 2-3 hours)4. Bring an empty bottle and a pair of clothes Trust me in singapore especially inside the studio everything's expensive. That's why an empty bottle will very helpful because you can refill it. And some attractions could wet your clothes. And to dryed it you have to pay.5. Jurassic Park First: you shouldnt play this attraction at the first time because you""ll get wet and its kinda suck. Second: Or you could bring a raincoatThird: Play this attraction when it's nearly closed.

It was cooling in the evening and the place was brightly lit up. We managed to watch the last waterworld show again and it was simply awesome! We could watch it over and over again. The fireworks were breathtaking too and I'm glad we made the right choice to wait for the 930pm show. Do find a good spot to view the fireworks early as it can get crowded as the time draws near.For families with children, it's advisable to buy half-yearly or annual passes so that you can enter USS for unlimited time during that period. We always catch different shows and do different rides for every visit there. All in all, it's happy place for kids and those young at heart!

review_390684304,“VIP Tour ”,"Although expensive, when visiting for one day only with our teenage children and not knowing if we would return to Singapore again, this is probably the best option, the VIP Tour. You are personally escorted. Olif, our guide, greeted us in the VIP Reception Lounge with cold drinks and snacks, explained to us what was available and asked us what we would like to see and do. We were issued with VIP lanyards and wrist bands, which all staff recognised.This guarantees no waiting, choice of seats on all rides, seat preference for the Shrek 4D Show and an air-conditioned box for the Water World Show. Also included is a $25 food voucher for each person and discounts at various merchandise shops.Olif's advice and knowledge informing us on which rides we might get wet and offering ponchos, security for our personal possessions while we were on rides, arranging private photo sessions with Universal Studio movie characters and even booking a restaurant so we wouldn't have to wait for a table is all part of the VIP service.

review_390573508,“Get the fast pass unlimited”,"We went this week and were blown away by the (approx) price of 60sgd entry and the unlimited fast pass we wanted at another 80sgd. However, when we walked past hundreds of people on every ride straight to the front cutting out 80 minute queues then it was worth every cent!! There are a great selection of rides here and the battle star galactica rivals uk rides like nemesis etc. The mummy is also fantastic but one of my favourite had to be the 4d transformers ride. We did it over and over and it was better each time! Sit in the back though you see more

Next time i ll definitely purchase the queue jumper tickets. Clean, safe facilities. Lots of fun. Drinks and food super expensive, but you're allowed to go out and eat. Make sure you get a stamp ;) $6 for a bottle of water was not ok. I don't care if they think thry can charge that, but i refuse to pay it.

With waits of 150mins for the top rides it did restrict how many activities that you were able to enjoy.

We paid our $80 plus for a ticket and expected that should get us in rides. But those with express passes (another $80) kept bumping us all off. So in essence, the price of a ticket is $160 if you want to get a ride. Food appalling, expensive, and place way too crowded. So glad to get out of there. Universal studios, you should be ashamed!

review_390092239,“~S$440 for less than 2 minutes of rides”,"We are a family of 5 with 3 children aged 5, 6 and 8. We had promised our children a visit to Universal Studios in lieu of other Christmas presents. Although I did not think I would get great enjoyment from the trip I had expected the kids would enjoy the day based on previous theme park trips, particularly our eldest (girl) and youngest (boy).This was the grand finale to a wonderful four week holiday.We deliberately chose a non holiday time in the hope of reduced queues.We caught a taxi to Vivo S$10 and got the monorail S$20 across (the taxi driver prophetically warned us and said we should go to the zoo instead.... but we had booked the tickets online S$316 and went ahead). We survived the lengthy queues and pushy people to get to Sentosa via the monorail. The queue to enter Universal Studios was mercifully short.We walked past what seemed to be an endless number of horrifically priced food stands (eg S$11 'hot dog') and crass merchandise stalls before deciding to go on the junior roller coaster (Enchanted Airways) ... estimated wait 20 minutes. More than an hour and twenty minutes later we did the approx 20 second roller coaster ride.Having seen the queue length my wife and I decided we should get 2x limited express pass (1 express ride on most attractions) for another S$120 so we could get one ride on each.We thought we would try one more ride before using the passes. The Lost World ride estimated wait ... you guessed it 20 minutes. Over an hour later and still at least a half hour until the end of the queue (the express queue was an 80 minute estimated!! wait by this stage) we abandoned the queue.In desperation to get our daughter a ride on something she might enjoy we looked at many other rides. The main ride, the Cyclon, was a 145 minute estimated!! wait (normal queue). Most others were at least 80 minute estimated wait time. Judging by the queues and our previous experience the express lane would have been that long and the normal queues several times that.At that point we gave up all hope.I sold the express passes because no refund was available despite them being unused for S$40 to some young Jordanian guys who were quoted S$70 each ... I know because I was standing in the queue behind them (how the price had increased S$10 in the 3.5 hours we had been there wasn't clear).We left around 2pm having waited almost 4 hours in queues for a combined total of less than 2 minutes of rides and spent nearly S$400 including the S$40 we sold the passes for.Worse than the wasted day and the considerable cost was the extremely disappointed daughter in tears and two very agitated boys.In the wise words of the taxi driver we should have gone to the zoo. This was, without doubt, one of the most offensive experiences I can recall. As a forgiving and pretty relaxed soul I could have laughed it off as a never to be repeated disaster save for the devastated look on my daughter's face when she admitted (against every instinct) that she saw no point in staying.I could add many more paragraphs about how tired and poorly maintained the facility appeared to be but in the scheme of things these are minor criticisms.I had a mind to take a photo of me burning some notes having more fun at considerably less cost than our family did at Universal Studios.Do yourself a favour and avoid.

However it is as clean as its counterpart in the L.A. Loved the fact that they have the smoked turkey legs which i loved in L.A. which they used to call alien legs. I would have give the attraction a 5 star if i was not to compare it to Universal L.A. on its own however its a 5 or even 10 all day long.

review_389950408,“Fun for the whole family where you can spend the entire day”,"We visited Universal on a Saturday in November. We pre booked out tickets online and pickup on the day. Once ticket was pickup at the counter there was a line to get into the theme park. It moved reasonable fast. We entered the park at opening time at 10am. Would advise to do most of the rides first thing within the first two hours as the lines to the rides weren't very long and some of them had no lines. During the afternoon some of the rides lines would be up to 1 to 2 hours. Most of the rides would have 3 separate lines. Most of the Roller Coaster rides are in the Sci-Fi City themed area. One for Single riders, one for couples/group and one for the Express pass holders. Found the line for Single riders to be a lot faster than the couple or group riders. If you’re not into the Roller Coaster rides then I would recommend the following shows that is fit for the entire family which includes WaterWorld, Shrek 4-D Adventure and Lights, Camera, Action! Obviously more people would visit on the weekend so would be best to visit during a weekday. Convenient located and easy to get to on public transport. Use the MRT to Harbour Front MRT station then change to a tram service to Universal Studios. Spent a whole day at the park and had a wonderful time.

review_389755924,“Nice Park... do plan ahead”,"We visited on a Saturday right after the school holidays ended and it was actually less crowded than we feared. Went there early and had breakfast at the food court outside the park. By the time we finished and get to the entrance at about 9.30am, the queue to enter has already started. At about 9.45am, they opened the gates and we headed straight for Transformers. Went straight through. Then next to Jurassic Park Rapids but found that they only open at 11am. So we went on to Shrek 4D and Madagascar crate ride. No queues so far. By the time we got back to Jurassic Park just after 11, we had to line up for about 30 mins - this was the longest wait we had for our visit, so I didn't think it was very bad. We went for the Sesame St show at 12 noon but did not find it very interesting - maybe good for younger kids, otherwise can skip that. Then we break for lunch and saw Water World after that. The green zone seats are ok - you may just get a sprinkling of water or your shoes wet.It was not an extremely hot day but very very humid so good to bring a fan along. Also felt that they should build sheltered walkways leading to the Water World because it was really exposed area. Luckily we didn't have to queue. We left at about 2pm to go home to rest, have dinner and returned to the park in the early evening for more rides and to see the fireworks. We did not stay for the 3pm parade because we were tired and it would be extremely hot to stay out in the open. When we returned in the evening, there was virtually no queue at any of the rides and we could repeat some of the rides that we wanted to do again. The fireworks display was ok, not great, lasted only 5 minutes and there was too much smoke obsuring the view.We felt that express pass is not required if you are able to visit just before opening and to return near closing and planned exactly what rides you want to do. The park is small so most of the time goes into waiting in lines. If there were no lines like in the evening, you could actually do many rides in 1 hour.

The crew which are in charge of seating the guests seem to be a bit lost, it takes a lot of time for them to load up each ride, therefore the waiting Times have significantly increased. The food prices are too high for the average, theme park quality. I suggest eating at the Mel's Drive In located in the New York City area, it's probably the best food in the park. As for the attractions, I really enjoy the Revenge of The Mummy (there's a nice single riders queue so you don't have to wait a lot) and Battlestar Galactica, of course ;)

review_389643884,"“""Fun Family Getaway""”","And so we had this little family trip to Singapore for a short sightseeing. We had options of going to the zoo, to the gardens or to universal studios. With my children 4 and 6 years old theres nothing more exciting than going to a theme park full of rides. So there we went ready for a day of family adventure. Since it was unplaned, we end up queing to get tickets. Tip, if u want it cheaper book ahead online. Rather than that it was a smooth ride going to the island via express monorail. Arrived there and started feeling the heat, people, but most of all the ambience of fun. There were performances on many corners. So many rides u not sure which one to start. Surprisingly, its only about 3 rides the children cant go because of height restriction, apart from that u can do it all. Most queus are long wait, u can either stay in line or come back later which we did for few rides and luckily it was way quicker and less wait for the second try. U can also get the quickest option to pay express pass for $50 /each if u want to go straight and no wait. Best rides not to miss i highly recommmend the transformers ride, shrek 4d and puss in boots giant journey! Kids definitely loved it and so as me and hubby. This is a good fun happy place to bring the kids along. Sunnies, hats and sunscreen is a must and most importantly bring along lots and lots of water, if not theres many stalls that sells water and other drinks for about $4-6. For families who wants a family fun weekend specially with young kids who likes rides and adventure, i highly recommend this place.

We were ready for this, and made sure we arrived around 40 minutes before the gates opened, so at least some of the queues had shorter wait times. The rides are all great, and we could not complain about anything, but for the budget conscious, bring your own food as the food is very expensive. An empty water bottle can also be filled from drinking taps around the park. Our family of 4 (kids 14 and 12) easily spent the whole day there, but we didn't pay extra for 'skip the queue' passes. However because this option is available, it slows the process down as these people tend to get ride priority - it is something worth considering. All in all however, a great day out.

review_389335597,“Hit or miss”,"Pros: transformers, the mummy, battlestar galactica, single rider lines.Cons: pushy people and loud children, poor queuing systems, terrible food, small parkThroughout my visit I went back and forth between whether I would rate this place a 2,3 or 4. It started as a 3 when I noted the smallness of it and the fact that the Jurassic park section inexplicably opened later than the rest. I was also irritated by the lack of order and regulation at the entry gates and the fact that many rides require you to use a locker.It dropped to a 2 when we waited forever through the multi-part, multi-line shrek show (full of impatient people and little order to the queue), followed by a similar experience at the underwhelming Madagascar ride (people shoving is the whole time). To top it off this was followed by eating at a terrible restaurant (oasis spice cafe) when our restaurant of choice (casa del wild) was inexplicably closed.But the overall experience improved once we managed a few well-timed single rider lines. We used the single rider line on transformers twice (making a 100 minute wait into 15 minutes the first time), on the Jurassic park canopy, puss n boots, and battlestar galactica: human. We also had great luck with short regular lines on the mummy, which we rode twice. The waterworld show was fantastic. It was also easy to get into and (thankfully) well-managed in audience flow (a rarity).Overall the general experience of the park could be improved immensely with better line management and a vast increases in food quality. Oasis spice cafe was almost inedible, yet still expensive. Jurassic park opening at 11 instead of 10 meant yet another crazy/frustrating mad dash of pushy people. (And on top of that the main attraction of the rapids ride was underwhelming after all of the hassle). Improving the lines would also include alternatives to the strict ""lockers only"" policy for personal possessions on certain rides. This was most irritating on battlestar galactica, where even wallets are banned (my husband got turned away from the line twice!). For the price, you can enjoy some very fun rides (transformers is the most awe-inspiring), which makes it worthwhile. Just make sure you go in with a plan and do as many single rider lines as you can.

review_389001897,“A good place to wait in a queue for hours ”,"Came here on a few occasions. Just like everything else touristy in Singapore however it was wildly crowded and ridiculously hot. Perhaps if they were to manage their admissions a bit better they would make the queues slightly more tolerable. Other than that the rides were brilliant. I'd prefer the Universal Studios in Hollywood or Orlando however. Kiasu and the heat certainly kills here

But it was only 2 that type. In any case for us it was first time in Universal Studio amusement park. As a first time it was amazing. Especially big impression for us left Transformers attraction, the Revenge of the I Mummy attraction (in Ancient Egypt zone). And the best of the best was show in The Lost World zone the attraction name: Waterworld.

Being smaller, it is much easier to do over Disneyland where one is mostly scrambling around. Likely due to tourist season but it was crowded (though well managed) hence highly recommended that one spend that extra $50 for UE Unlimited pass

There are some kiddy rides but it's great fun for the puss n boots ride, transformers, canopy ride and jurassic water ride.

review_388610922,“Comfortable for a One Day Visit”,"Went with my family for my birthday on a hot and humid Saturday in June. Bought the Universal Express Unlimited which was a waste, should have bought the Universal Express only as we never really had time to go for a 2nd ride on any of the attractions. Try and get there as the park opens as it gets very busy after lunch. The best rides for a 5 year old - Madagascar A Crate Adventure, Puss In Boots Giant Journey, Transformers The Ride, Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure( feet completely underwater) and the show Waterworld was very realistic and action packed. Character Meet and Greets were plentiful - Elsa from Frozen, Minions and others. In the afternoon, it began to rain and they cancelled the parades. make sure you take umbrellas as a standard as it rains almost every afternoon and it is an outdoor attraction with little to very few indoor gathering places. Lots of food and beverage areas. Overall a great experience and can be fully done in 1 day.

review_388355343,“Fun times”,"I visited on the first Saturday of July and hesitated about buying the priority pass. I'm glad I didn't bother as it was not as busy as I thought it would be and the maximum time I waited for a ride was only half an hour. Lucky me. There are plenty of food options and it is not overpriced without being extremely cheap. The best ride for me was the Transformer ride. I also really enjoyed watching the Hollywood parade. I think the trick is to start the day early and be there as soon as the gates open so that you can get onto all your preferred rides while the queues are relatively short. A good day out and no rain. I recommend not getting the priority pass until you have entered the park to check the length of the queues. You can always buy the priority pass once you are inside if you decide the queues are excessively long.

review_388281946,“Fun Day for the Kids”,"While this is not the largest theme park it does have enough to offer to fill a day of fun. Especially if you have children. However unless you're prepared to go on the rides there's not a great deal more to see in the way of shows and attractions. Even at my age I can still enjoy a 4D Shrek movie. I'd have been quite happy if the show had been longer but I know there's a turnaround to consider. The Madagascar ride was fun and would suit all ages. The waterworld show is certainly the most dynamic show its jet skis and pyrotechnics but it fills quickly and if you're last you could end up in the 'going to get soaked' area. The 70 minute wait for the Jurassic water ride was a little too long especially at the thought of knowing that a soaking was more than guaranteed. As with all these theme parks merchandise shops are a plenty and food is the same unless you head out to one of the restaurants. Price was reasonable at $74SGD. On a hot day I can imagine it would become unbearable so make sure you have plenty of water ($6 in the park) and head to a shop for some air-conditioning every so often. Worth a visit.

review_388038204,“WELCOME! TOURISTS!”,"As a Singaporean, I finally got a chance to visit USS in Singapore. Here are the highlights or not: 1. Many rides. The scary ones and the child-friendly ones. You can spend the whole day there and might not be able to complete the rides. 2. Remember to deposit your bags using one of those lockers outside USS. some rides cannot afford you to bring your bags up and sway with you. 3. The food inside USS is not cheap neither it is too expensive. Compared to other parts of Sentosa, it is reasonable. BUT: 1. the queue for the rides are way toooooo long. some rides queue time is 60-75 mins. 2. Singapore has only 2 weathers- hot and rainy. Too hot a weather and the long waiting time will spoil your vacation mood. and if it is rainy, most outside rides won't be open.

Go to the ""transformer ride"" first as it will be a long wait later. If you are the 1st batch in the queue, you can still manage to go for a 2nd ride immediately after you completed the first ride.4. After the Transformer Ride, go to the Mummy ride which is located near to the transformer ride.5. Go to ""Waterworld"", find out the show schedule as this is a show that cannot be missed.6. There will be street performance at certain time of the day. Please check with the staff on the timing.7. There are also many performance which you need to ask for the schedule.8.

Getting there by opening time is an absolute MUST if you don't want to waste your time standing in lines endlessly. Also, going on a weekday helps. We went on a Wednesday and reached by 9:30 am. As a result, we quickly went through the Shrek 4 D show and the Revenge of the Mummy ride with a 10 min wait time in the first and zero wait time in the second.The Transformer rides though were chock-a-block by then with 80 min wait time. So, we used a tip I picked up on some ta reviews and and waited till after 5 pm. And believe it or not, the wait time dropped to 5 min on the Human and around 15 min on the Cylon!!

We were recommended by friends to pay the extra money to get an express pass and that made the day for us so much more enjoyable! If you can't afford the extra for the express pass I would recommend getting to the park later in the day about after 2-3 pm as all the kids are tuckered by this time so most families have gone. The wait time for one ride in the morning was 90 minutes by the afternoon it was only 15 minutes. The food is expensive so if you want to save some money take a backpack and pack your own snacks and definitely take some water with you. They do have water fountains so you can keep topped up!

review_386791288,"“Great fun for kids, but time consuming waits”","This is of course Universal Studios and they have 7 different sections to this large area. There are tons of attractions and kids can go wild (and so can us adults) :)make sure you get there early, plan which rides you wish to be in in advance and get in line soon. Popular rides very quickly build up huge lines, specially the 2 major roller coasters.Tip: If you're alone or don't mind being split up with your companions for seating in a ride, you can take the ""Single Visitor"" lines in most rides. These let you skip to the front quite quickly.

review_386591882,“Fantastic day out and can easily be done in a day”,"Having spent many a day in Universal in Florida we decided to visit the one in Singapore during a 2 day stopover from Australia back to England.We got there early and paid the extra for the fast pass as we knew it would get busy and wanted to save time on queuing in the humidity, great idea worked perfectly.We pretty much went on all the rides and my 6 year old loved the Madagascar part and the Far Far Away Land and Shrek and Dragon rides. Transformers is always a must ride and just the same as in Florida as is the Mummy Ride which I did alone while my son stayed with his Grandma. Jurassic Park River Rapids was brilliant for cooling us all down. Well worth a visit for the day, we love Universal and although smaller than Florida there's enough action packed rides and adventure to have a great family day out. Enjoy it x

review_386255365,“Busy Park with a lot of hype”,"I like to read about things prior to going, and most reviews including a phone call to Universal Studios prior to going to the Park informed me that not buying the expensive express pass was a good thing. THIS IS WRONG. Buy the express pass or risk waiting 90 minutes for a ride. The park is small compared to others in the world,. and the volume of people is high. Meaning that there are long queues for everything and lots of pushing and shoving as people try to make their way around the park. It is good that it is open until late. I stayed from 10am - 7pm, after 5pm the crowds left and ques no longer became an issue.

review_386248843,“OK first experience but long queue”,"I was there with my 3.5 and 6 years old and my parents (65 and 69 y.o) so we werent too ambitious in trying out all the rides. We got out tickets from klook.com and getting inside was a breeze. It was a thursday on a school holiday. My 3.5 doesnt need a ticket, the minimum age to get a ticket is 4.We got there by taxi at around 10.00 just when it opens. We needed to rent strollers and electric chairs for my parents. The queue was longggg with 1 person handling the payment, getting and preparing for the stuff, AND teaching people how to use them. I spent ard 30-40 minutes just to get mine and i was no 3 in the queue. Later in the day i knew that the electric chairs has ran out.We wanted to try the elmo show but the queue was around 1 hour long, so we skipped and walked further inside. The good thing is all of the rides states the approximate waiting time, so u can decide to go or not.The next one was the battlestar galactica. The queue was said to be around 40 minutes, so we tried the cylon one. While we were queueing, we saw a lot of universal express holders passing us by in the queue. Well maybe that is worth the price you are paying if you intend to try all. Due to the kids and older folks in my group, we were less ambitious :pThe ride was awesome..u will be twist, hung, at a high speed, worth the wait :DThen we had lunch at the food court at the lost world area, there were chicken rice, churros, waffles and meatballs, they were decently priced for a theme park, around sgd 11/12 per course.After lunch, we continue to the lost world and tried some attractions there.Then they were the madagascar spot. We were then less eager to go on anymore rides, mostly due the heat and humidity..We walked slowly out and return the stoller and electric chair and decided to chill for a while on the seats in front of USS. There was a fountain near there, some kids were playing water there.My younger daughter forgot her toy so we went back in..the ticket still valid and the toy was safely kept at lost and found section :)Overall the theme park is rather small but convenient with the needed facility, worth at least 1 visit.

The rollercoasters are nice, but if you take out all the ""only kids"" attractions, only four rides are worth it. Could use a new high thrill rollercoaster. TOO good security on the rides make it not very pratical... have to use a locker at each ride. you cannot have anything in your pockets no matter how secure it is, i understand the coins, phones etc, but a wallet that has no chance of coming out of your pocket might be a little too much. nevertheless recommend the park if you have spare time in singapore and want to enjoy a theme park ambiance.

review_385183464,“Bad place”,"My girl friend and I arrived and were inside the front gate just before 11am. It was a Thursday not even a weekend we lined up for transformers ride which takes about 6 minutes to complete. So we waited and waited and waited and waited and the transformers line goes from 1 waiting room to the next the que was not even full and we waited 1hour and 35minutes. Oh on a positive note they have 2 free drink fountains in the que which you will need standing there for 1 to 2 hours wasting your day. So we went out and thought lets find another ride with a small que time all ques were 40minutes to 1.5hrs so we had lunch that was extremely over priced and the worst food we had eaten in singapore. After this I just left. I would not recommend this to anyone unless your the type of person that likes to pay $65 for a train ride only to find out the train is 2 hours late and you enjoy waiting at the station that has no beer for you to pass the time with. Then the train finally comes you ride it for 6minutes and they say changing lines and please wait another hour for your next 6minute section repeat this 3 times and your day is over. Oh yes no resturants even serve a beer with lunch.

review_385136172,“Saddest Universal Studios”,"Service in this amusement park is nothing compared to what you know as the Universal Studios service i.e. where you see staff everywhere. Here there's 1-2 staff per ride (i.e. in the carousel there was 1 staff letting people in, buckling people on the seats, operating the carousel). That's why all the rides take longer than they really should. We went there at lunch time then it started pouring down rain at about 2 p.m. and all the rides were shut. There's not many areas to take cover except for restaurants - so we wasted our entry; no compensation was given (I guess go at your own risk). So look at the weather first when in Singapore (mind you the weather forecast in Singapore was never accurate when we were there).The characters (i.e. like minions and Madagascar) only came out twice a day and interaction with them was very limited (i.e. 10 mins); felt like the kids were being deprived of seeing their cartoon characters.Overall I think it's still something to do. If it wasn't too expensive and had good service then the cost of entry would be worth it.

I feel like there is no need to get unlimited. By 4,5pm the rides will get rather empty so you can just go for the normal queue if you want to go for any rides again. However the express tickets saved us a lot of time queuing as every queue had an average 40-50mins of waiting time. It was hot and everybody was sweating, definitely not very pleasant to wait for that long with a sweaty crowd.

review_385117751,“Amazing fun for all ages...”,"We went to Universal Studios at Sentosa with our 5yr old daughter. She had a blast, and so did we! It was very well mapped out, with a separate theme for each part of the park. My daughter obviously enjoyed the part with princesses, puss-in-boots and other characters she grew up with rather than transformers etc. We skipped some parts of the park since we were short on time and since we thought she would not understand. I went on some of the scarier rides (like the transformers one) while my daughter loved rides like the Madagascar one and dinosaur park onesOne serious warning: holiday season is definitely not the time to visit! We went during Christmas and we had to wait 2-3 hours for each ride, which was a definite mood-spoiler, which the occasional drizzle making matters worse. It helps if you pay extra and get the priority pass where you can cut queues for certain rides.And pls make sure you go there as early as possible and stay the entire day so that you have ample time to enjoy Universal Studios to the fullest.

review_384907358,“USS will never disappoint”,"Some will say USS is overrated but I would have to disagree. It's a super fun place to spend the day with family or friends! My first visit was in Dec 2012 and my visit for the 2nd time this May 2016 just showed how dedicated the theme park is to providing more entertainment to visitors; in a span of 3+ years, they added a lot of new attractions and gimmicks for all to enjoy.If you're on a budget, you can take the MRT to Harbourfront Station. I'd recommend having an early lunch at Vivo City's food court before heading over to Sentosa Island via the Sentosa Boardwalk (which is for free until Dec 2016 only!). The food inside USS is expensive; you can get a full meal for 6 SGD at the food court whereas that can only get you a sandwich inside USS. I would also highly suggest that you buy tickets online to avoid wasting time lining up at the ticket counters because you are certainly and inevitably going to wait a long time lining up in some attractions, especially the popular ones. Once inside, get a copy of the show schedules for the day (it's located on the stands with the maps) so you can check out which shows you want to see during your stay at USS and you can plan out your day. Rides I would recommend lining up for early:1. Battlestar Galactica Human vs Cylon2. Transformers: The Ride 3. Jurrasic Park Rapids AdventureAs for the rollercoaster rides, if you feel a little less brave, go for the Human first then Cylon. For the transformers ride, it will take you at least an hour (2-3 hours during peak season) to get to the actual ride. Also, if you're going to ride the rapids adventure, you will definitely get wet so bring a dry bag with you or leave it at the lockers (there are lockers you can use for free for 45 minutes at sci-fi city and ancient egypt. Didn't notice any at Jurrasic Park though).Be sure to look around you carefully so you can catch some of the mascots that are roaming around! You can take photos with them for free if you can find them.Lastly, you must definitely check out Waterworld. It's one of the best shows in the theme park and the actors do live stunts during the show. It's awesome! Fair warning: this area has different ""zones"" in the bleachers so if you're willing to sit in the ""Soak"" and ""Splash"" zones, bring some extra clothes because during the pre-show, the actors play around with the audience and purposely soak people near the set.USS closes at 6pm or 9pm. It depends. If you go there on a weekend, you get to see their parade.

I highly recommend this as the wait time on the rides when we were there were up to 65 minutes which is crazy!

That's itThe Jurrasic park ride is a water ride and you will get wet and it is very tameThe 4d shrek show and the Steven Spielberg show was lots of fun Very clever marketing by Universal Studios.

review_384760455,“Not a lot but you'll want it again! ”,"The park boasts about 20 rides or so with LOTS of street entertainment and shows (especially the Meet & Greet for the Minions - it's crazy!) to keep the bustling crowd alive. In my opinion, the variety here isn't a wow BUT however you'll be wanting MORE go's after your first try! In the recent years, the park has been popular with the local teens, like myself, and I have had the experience of both a Standard and an Express. Regardless if you're visiting as a solo or as a family, I would highly recommend you to get the Express Ticket and to avoid the Standard Ticket. You'll have the privilege of priority queues which should not be more than 5-7 minutes whereas the Standard Ticket could take you through 45 to 120 minutes (yes, 2 crazy hours!) of waiting. Or 30 minutes, that is if you're lucky! This is purely my observation after visiting Universal regularly for the past 6 months. Though there's a state of ""Peak Season"" or ""Holiday Season"", I think every single day is a Peak Season. It seems like there's no day or month where the park is low in visitors! Well, this shows how awesome USS is. So for a more maximal and time-efficient experience, grab an Express Ticket! You certainly won't regret! Oh, and be sure to watch out for afternoons @ 2-4pm because that's when crowds start to congregate. I'm sure by 6 it'll be dispersed by 50% so with a Standard Ticket, you can probably enjoy shorter-than-usual queues till 8 when the Park closes. Though, check online for the operating hours as it may vary.Some rides that brought me back many great memories are the BattleStar Galactica, the Mummy and the Transformers! Side note: I'm someone who used to have a phobia of rollercoasters. I brought a friend along to help me overcome my fear by going through a 10-in-row Mummy ""Therapy"". Of course, we did beat the long queues with our Express Passes!

review_384483634,“A fun theme park experience in Singapore”,"Despite living in the US, I had never visited a Universal Studios theme park before, so Universal Singapore was my first experience and cannot be compared with Orlando or LA. With that being said, I had a thrilling time here. there are 7 sections of the park. There are enough attractions to keep a visitor busy most of the day. Lines for rides aren't too terribly long (apart from Battlestar Galactica: Cylon), and if you're a single rider, most rides are simply a 5-10 minute wait away. Food and souvenirs are overpriced, but entry tickets (at $74 Singapore dollars) aren't, in my opinion. There is a good mix of thrill rides with slower rides and water rides. I enjoyed my time here and would probably return if ever in the Singapore area again.

Look at the crowd while entering USS and decide for yourself.In SG veg is egg or Mushrooms,I am not fond of either of them hence the struggle.Vegetarians--Do Pack nibbles for yourself or you survive on Slush/Coke(btw i only survived on Slush) etc.After every ride you come out to the merchandise store(Madagascar,Shrek etc).These are pretty expensive.I had been there on a Tuesday and have covered The Spielberg Show,Shrek Movie and the Soak Party(@3pm).Connectivity is a Boon in SG,Just follow the Instructions in USS(ViVO City/Beach) and you can travel cheap and quick. I had an misconception that we might have to walk far from Vivo city to catch MRT to Clarke Quay(my station).This isn't the case,within the mall is where MRT is..THUMB RULE is to follow instructions anywhere and everywhere.

I wanna ride that I wanna ride those I wanna enter that and many more.. But, the queue is so so long especially during school holiday season, otherwise you buy a VIP membership or COME EARLY if you dont have VIP membership/pass. There is so much attraction in this place and it was awesome experience.

This place is pretty big so do spare out one day .It has a mix of thrilling as well as fun filled rides . The best of them were Roller coaster , Egyptian Mummy , Transformers 3D Simulation , Lights Camera Action Etc. There are various eating points which offer good and cheap food.

review_384262440,“Scary Ride”,"Finally took the courage to take the rides on Battlestar Galactica. I took the ride with my teenage daughter. It was a great and scary experience for both of us. With the ride going at 90km/hr, the rain was less of a worry than the ride slide down from high point (a few times). The transformer rides was much better. It is good to have a express pass, otherwise you will be spending more time on the queue than trying to enjoy the various rides.

For the ride, i prefer the thrill one, like Battlestar galactica (you should seat at the back for red/human, and shoul seat at the front for blue/cyclon), Transformers 4D ride, you should seat at the front seat! You'll get better vision! Mummy ride, where ever you seat it still thrilling, and trust me, it will suprise you!

review_384008064,“Quite good but not that big!”,"To get here, take the MRT subway to Harbourfront Station and enter Vivo City mall. Take the escalators up to the very top level of Vivo City mall and you can either buy your tickets here (about 20 minutes in line) or from the ticket booth near Universal Studios. (Cost around $74.00 AUD). You can walk across the bridge from Vivo City to Universal Studios or take the Sentosa Express (monorail, $4.00 AUD for a return ticket). The wait for the monorail is about 15 minutes in the morning and about 30 minutes of an evening. Universal Studios Singapore still costs around the same as Universal Studios Japan but it seems like it's only about half as big. This could partially be because they don't have a Wizarding World of Harry Potter like they do in Japan. I'd say you could easily see everything here in about 7 hours, whereas Japan would take you about 14 hours. The Battlestar Galactica Rollercoaster is very good (especially the blue Cylon coaster) but I'd say the rest of the attractions range between average to above average). Most rides also have a ""single rider"" queue which will get you on the ride much faster than the normal line.

review_383946575,“Extraordinary experience”,"AAH SERIOUSLY THIS PLACE IS A MUST VISIT. You can possibly experience and feel here all the feelings in just a day that should be experienced in a long period of time. Nervousness, Excitement, Happiness, Sadness, name it and you can probably feel all. Even though, almost all the rides has long lines, once you get in there you will realized that falling in line for like at least 30 minutes.My favorite ride was probably the transformers ride, it was so intense and so reality-like. We waited for like more or less 30 mins but staying in line was not really that boring because of the interior of the ride. So many interesting thing and you can really see that there are a lot of Filipinos living and visiting Singapore. The staffs are also very accommodating and the foods in there were really good. Especially that one stall that's selling corn dog and mash potato.I recommend you guys to go visit this place. I swear it is worth the money, time and effort

SCI-FI City Ride with Transformer is chance less and we have to believe that it is illusion after coming out. It takes days to come out of that illusion. Lost World, Madagascar, Far Far away, Ancient Egypt Drives are hard to explain and you have to experience it to cherish the same.Shrek 4D Adventure and Puss in Boots are enjoyable.

You have enough and more number of things to do the whole day or beyond a day.To avoid larger queues it's better to go on a Tuesday or a Wednesday (which is not on school holidays). Otherwise the priority access is required.Also try to book the tickets in advance to avoid the queue at the entrance. These will be long and you will loose valuable time which could have been spent inside the park at the entrance.

review_383847022,“Great experience! ”,"We went on a Friday reached around 10 and decided to head to transformer ride... It was a painfully long waiting time more than 1 hour- with kids and elders it was difficult. Saw few people exiting after waiting for more than half an hour. But the later part of the day was good and easy with lesser waiting time.Shrek 4D was fun kids and adults enjoyed alike. Mummy ride was fun- kids waited with grandparents till we finished the ride. Meeting and clicking pics with Pinocchio was fun! Madagascar is a good theme area for kids- the boat ride, merry-go-round was good but nothing interesting for adults. Steven Spielberg s 'light camera action' was good but too short and you are left wanting to see more... Didn't get much time in the lost world... All in all a good experience, a nice place, with drinking water available every where- even in the waiting queues, clean washrooms. Negatives -1. a little heavy on the pocket 2.Rides don't have variety - mostly Rollercoaster 3. Waiting queues of more than half an hour for a 5-7 minutes ride dampens the experience 4. As much the kids might want to buy a souvenir from the shops they are all overpriced, you ll get Shrek at almost half the price at hamleys. 5.Prefer going in the middle of the week weekends are not worth it!

review_383844599,"“Good, but still not worth the money!!”","Visited USS during 1st week June 2016. Although we visited on Friday still it was crowded due to tourist groups. Had to wait for 1 hour for Transformer ride which was painful with 2 small kids and elders in group, but the ride was excellent. Found long waiting in Dinosoaring ride also which is for small kids only. We found thinner crowd post lunch and could do Far-away and Madagascar rides with 5 mins waiting. 4D Shrek show is excellent one. Light, Camera Action by Spielberg was interesting but not a great one. Street shows are good.Food options limited for vegetarians. All rides - Mummy, Gallactica, Puss in boots, etc - are variants of roller coaster only. With the price of ticket paid for adults, there should be other ride variants. Express Pass isn't worth for family with kids as beyond a point one gets bored with roller coaster rides only and won't do all rides.

I'd recommend that pirate show and the Transformers 4D ride thing. That Transformers one was amazing. We got to see this replica of Scorponok's detached tail. I totally geeked out. Also there were different sections like there was a Sci-fi section and a Fairytale section and a bunch of other sections. Just go! It'll be really fun and take sunscreen

The transformers ride was a bit underwhelming but the mummy indoor coaster was really fun. Some of the kids attractions based on animated movies were good too. The two big roller coasters were not in operation so was a bit disappointed. The Jurassic park river ride was really good. Food was ok for a theme park. They have a starbucks inside. Some of the shows like the waterworld skit were better than expected (TBH I had really low expectations going in).

review_383401254,“Family Day at USS”,"Great day to celebrate and have family fun with my daughters and wife, for their first trip to Singapore. And no trip to SG is complete without a visit to Sentosa and Universal Studios Singapore. USS is a delight for the family. Despite its smaller size compared to the original version in Hollywood and to other theme parks, the list of attractions of USS does not pale in comparison. We were there in mid June and surprisingly there was no big crowd inside the resort which usually causes long queues. Probably due to our weekday visit. In 6 hours, we managed to enjoy 7 attractions and have lunch without the stressful throng of visitors. The following attractions were indeed enjoyable: Steven Spielberg's Lights Camera Action, Madagascar boat ride, Enchanted airways, Shrek 4D, Transformers - The ultimate 3D battle, Canopy flyer and Revenge of the Mummy. Blast from the past was provided by Sesame Street - complete cast of characters. Very enjoyable trip, and it deserves a next visit.

I am so glad we paid extra as we were quick to get on the rides and with the humidity I would hate to have waited up to an hour to get on the rides . There was really only 5 main ones that appealed to adults (and 4 of these were roller coasters) so it's a lot to pay (we also tried a couple of other subdued rides )but we still enjoyed our family day but think Australian Gold Coast theme parks offers better value , more engaging rides and appeals more.

review_382638730,“樂不思蜀”,"坦白說，這次到新加坡的目的就是要去環球影城。為什麼？就是因為可以親親迷你兵（小小兵）！你可以能說日本也有影城，但因為我比較喜歡語言相通的地方，而且新加坡不斷在超越香港，所以有一點情義結下選定了這一個地方。因為通過新航假期訂了獅城全景通一日遊（24小時），成人門票已經包括在全景通內，沒有額外付款入場。旅遊景點一向都是人多，特別是假日，所以我們選擇在星期四進場。果然人流沒有假日那麼多，但仍是有很多人，也見到印度國藉遊客一家大細，一行最少六人來遊玩，家庭樂實在是一種福氣。用全景通的可以到遊客服務站換領門票，不用在售票亭換票，節省很多時間。之後，我們就進場了。我們走在最左邊接近全年通行證的入口排隊，由於保安理由，所有遊客都要檢查所帶來的背包。香港的兩大樂園都是慣例，沒意外，也會乖乖排隊等安檢。後來，職員看見人流多了，就馬上開放全年通入口，疏導人流，非常欣賞。我們前面的是印藉遊客，差不多到安檢位置，但職員就示意叫我們從全年通入場，也沒有檢查我的只有三份之一的小手袋，就看看丈夫的背包就給我們走了。很奇怪，心裡有很多疑問。我們真的很像新加坡本地人嗎？進場到荷李活區已經被迷你兵商店、裝飾所吸引，難捨難離...我們沒有甚麼遊玩的策略，就是每個都玩就可以，也記住迷你兵出場拍照的時間即可。於是，我們向左開始玩，先與荒失失奇兵拍下第一場兩人照，接著玩它的小舟。本以後是室內有空調，但進場後不是太冷吧！還可以。看見熟悉的卡通人物有不同的造型，多搞笑！之後，我們就走到Far Far Away山卡拉國的史力加主題區玩4D影院。從荒失失奇兵區走到史力加區都不過一分鐘，節省很多腳骨力！讚！室內的空調太讚了！進場前別忘記自己領取3D眼鏡。沒有膽量玩倒轉整個人的過山車，可以玩Puss in Boots Giant Journey貓貓小型過山車。都有一點速度的～緊記要把小型物品放在自己的背包中，為安全起見，不要自拍了！離開之後，過了一分鐘便到了侏羅紀公園。我們只是玩了Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure（激流）和欣賞Live Show The Lost World。這天就只有這一個設施排了45分鐘，其餘都不用花時排隊。這個激流真是一試難忙！建議大家穿涼鞋或防水鞋，即使上身不濕，浪花都會沖入座位腳步，我們的鞋就此全濕。可能是幸運，上身沒有濕。但是，看見對面的印藉遊客（真的很多）因浪花濕了一次（大濕），不久浪花再向她沖，最後浪花目標都是她，連中三元，本來與不同國藉遊客都是暗笑，最後都忍不住大笑起來。木伐要坐升降機！太刺激啦！所以，排45分鐘都是值得，而且現在可以上網，時間很快過....如果大家怕背包弄濕，激流附近就有一個45分鐘免費locker，讚！帶著不斷的笑聲和沈重的腳步（全濕）到最接近的洗手間，馬上清潔腿步。烈日當空，而且鞋子濕透了，就在一個不太顯眼和不會阻礙其他遊客的地方曬鞋。正好在清潔的時候可以等待The Lost World Live Show，沒安排反而比有安排更好。The Lost World Live Show開場前的氣氛真是很好！在座位上已經註明必濕身區（全濕）、部份濕身區和不會濕身區，大家按自己的勇氣選位吧～節目真是很精彩！我們帶了行山小背包，在水袋中裝了2.2公升清水，不到一個早上就喝清了！到新加坡真的要多喝清水，在戶外排汗量很厲害。但整體來說比濕熱的香港舒服得多。就是正午的時候，最好就是跑到室內。我們回到Far Far Away與Donkey驢仔對話。太搞笑啦！這次進場人數特別多，Donkey不客氣的問拍當為什麼這麼多人。他一語導出主因.......因為這裡有免費空調!!!!!!哈哈哈!!!!!只要大家投入，氣氛真不錯！樂在其中！終於可以跟迷你兵合照啦！太感動！！！！！不過Bob的腳太長了！見到有少女打扮成迷你兵，作為粉絲真係自愧不如呢！在紐約區還有Elmo與朋友，也有一個適合小朋友的Live Show劇場。對於我們作為職青的，覺得比較悶，而且曬了一整天，有舒適的座位和空調不由自主的打盹了。但到了未段是可以與Elmo擊掌的！同區的Sesame Street Stage Shows就可算是巡遊吧！畢竟影城面積還比香港迪士尼細小，明白的！接受的！Light, Camera Action, Hosted by Steven Spielberg的正門不顯眼，但大人切勿錯過，可以親身感受拍電影的實境！太震撼了！也在此呼籲我們每一位都應該尊重影視人員的辛勞，支持正版及創作！離開後走了不過一分鐘通過Sci-Fi City就進入埃及區Ancient Egypt。很壯觀！Revenge Of the Mummy是一個不會倒轉身的過山車，但進場前一定要把所有隨身物品儲在locker或由親友保管。Locker首45分鐘也是免費的。未進場時看見這個過山車的設計與佈置，「心血小一點都想縮沙」。真是有點怕，但女生就是這樣，有男生相陪都要跟著去。當然，如果大家真的覺得不舒服就不要去，只是會錯過這個很好玩的設施。由於人流太少，基乎可以說不用排隊，真想再玩一次！膽量小的我說的是真的！只是在門口走到上車的路實在太遠了才放棄玩第二次。過山車不是人人都可以玩，但這裡就有一個家庭室供遊客等待要刺激一番的親友，讚！回到Sci-Fi City，在紅藍兩軌道下近距離欣賞兩條高速過山車的速度感。沒有登上去都覺得太刺激啦！離開影城最後一站就是回到起點－迷你兵商店！帶了一些日後可以回憶的紀念品，還有整作了迷你兵紀念幣（S$2/個，最便宜的紀念品），心滿意足的離開了～

review_382634596,“It was just okay!”,"I went here on a Sunday with a friend and I'd say this place is definitely for kids. It was kinda boring! I've been to Disneyland so I guess once you've been to Disneyland nothing can impress you more. I loved the extreme couple extreme rides for adults though and the transformer ride. It's a good place to visit if you want to burn money and time, otherwise, just buy yourself a good meal instead in Singapore. ;-)

review_382631202,“Great day out with kids”,"Visited on a weekday during the school holidays, and it was crowded. Long queues to enter during opening but didn't have to wait too long to go in. Not a very big park, but there are rides suitable for kids and adults alike. As we visited with young children, we did not get to ride on the roller coasters but we had fun on the kiddy rides. The queues had shorter waiting times in the morning when there were shows going on, and also in the evening when half the crowd had left. If you do not have the whole day to spend here, getting an express ticket might be an option though pricey. Otherwise, you can enjoy all the rides without a queue in the evening.

review_382411149,“Loved it!”,"Great day out, not a massive sprawling theme park but they pack a good punch when it comes to rides.The Curse of the Mummy was by far the best ride. A completely indoor roller coaster, flames, vid screens and the best bit is 70% is in near darkness which adds to the thrill of it. 9.5/10Jurassic Park water ride, you will get soaking wet and thats half the fun, in Singas heat and humidity its a welcome soaking 8/10Madagascar ride, nothing hardcore about this one, takes place inside the marooned ship from the movie. You sail through the ship with various scenes from the movie played out as you ride. If your a fan of the movie ( as I am and im 44 lol) you will enjoy this 7/10"" the foosa are always crashing our parties and ripping our limbs off"" - King JulianShrek 4D, cool short movie where its 3D plus you move and feel as well 8/10 My advice is to buy express ride tickets with your park entry, you will thank me I guarantee.

review_382377432,"“No information, No hospitality mind at all”","Firstly, we bought our tickets at MRT ticket counter at Orchard station then we went there. At the gate the attendant girl said 'You cant get in this tickets,go guest service window', then went there, a guest service girl said 'You go to locker room!,,,,,,,,,' I replied what? locker room?' 'Yes' Even we could not understand why locker room, but we went there. So, we found the Scan Machine in the locker room. But machine wasn't able to connect the host computers, so we could not get print tickets and no attendant in the locker room, then I went back the gate ask help about our ticketing. A girl replied me 'you go to guest service!' Then I said 'I need your supervisor or manager right now' Finally s supervisor came with me to go back to the locker room, and she found machine broken down, then she did use her radio to call someone to fix it. We wasted more than 30mins. before went in site!! One another problem was so call 'universal express', when we made long long queue every ride in site, people went trough our side to go to ride without made queue. I asked many attendants but none of them could not able to answer, because every day and even time of the day those tickets may vary prices and no written information at all. Over all, almost impossible to meet attendants to ask help or assistance, only boys or girls standing each ride entrance. We felt very uncomfortable whole day. You have to study and research deeply well before you go there, otherwise you waste your time and money.

review_382364079,“Fun day”,"Universal studios is a huge movie theme based amusement park. They have transformer rides in sci-Fi section. Madagascar theme, fantasy theme and lots more. You can get wet in few rides so choose the rides with caution. Few roller coaster rides are extreme. They have rides for all ages and its super fun.

review_382355204,“Small but definitely worth the trip”,"The USS is small compared to it's counterparts in LA or Osaka but it was sure fun to be able to ride almost all of the attractions thanks to the express pass. Our kids definitely had fun riding roller coasters for the first time and seeing their favourite characters coming out dancing and taking pictures with them.

review_382330226,“Better than expected”,"Having been to Universal Studios in LA, we (2 adults and 3 children aged 18, 16, 12) were expecting something similar. Whilst this theme park doesn't have the back lot to tour through, there are still lots of rides for all ages. We had expected to buy an express pass but on the day we went, the queues were all ok, the longest being about 30 minutes and most were shorter. We had a great time and went on all the rides we wanted and saw all the shows we wanted in a short day. Definitely worth a visit.

review_382136833,“Small theme park with activities for all”,"If you have been to original one is US or to Paris, then this one will be a big disappointment as it is not only very small compare to them but not many rides & attractions also. However, if this is your 1st visit to studio, then you must go & will enjoy a lot. 1st of all, if it's very rushy, go for express pass only even though it is slightly expensive as at times there is such a long wait (upto 90 minutes for one ride) that you will waste time in queues & will eventually not able to cover the entire park in one day. Express pass takes you straight to the rides & if yu enjoy it, you can repeat it again & again. If you are a solo traveler, then go for normal ticket as they have separate que for solo riders which will avoid long waiting for you. Few rides & attractions are very boring & nothing great but depends whether you are a child or an adult. If yu take an express pass then you will able to cover entire studio as well as other attractions of resort sentosa with nite show at beach in one day.

review_382111446,“Disappoinitng”,"It was very disappointing given all the popularity and there was a line for almost every ride or attraction. However, it is not very attracting for families with teen children because most of the attractions are for young kids and there are more eateries than rides. Also, be prepared for rain because the weather is very unpredictable.
