review_382068408,“Amusing”,"Finally able to visit one of the places on my checklist. The whole place was amazing and the staff are very kind to take pictures for the visitors. However, I wish there were more rides to accommodate more people.

review_382062239,“An interesting place to be definitely.”,"Since this was the first theme park I visited, it was quite interesting. The rides were experience in themselves, and the performances and the small shows in each park was added advantage. My only gripe with the place is that they don't have vegan or pure vegetarian food options, but otherwise it is an amazing place to be.

review_382060835,“Queuing for 2 hours - no thanks ”,"Hard to enjoy a theme park when the lines are all between 45 and 120 minutes long. There is the option of buying a $50 express pass (in addition to the $70) entry, but it makes the day so expensive for what it is. Also the Rides need to be better organised

review_382048606,“If you like waiting in lines go here”,"All very underwhelming as an experience. Staff seemed to be unhappy and very grumpy. Not the experience at Universal Studies would want to be linked to I am sure so not sure what has gone wrong with this franchise.The ""experiences"" seemed to be a little tired and in dire need of a refresh.Poor queue management to get through the turnstiles on arrival. Rather worrying was that there were no security checks on entry to the facility at all.Overpriced place to visit, but enough people seemed happy for pay for this.

review_381745333,“Awesome Fun”,"This was a great place to visit. Lots to see and do. The rides were awesome, ques weren't too bad. Only critisim is that staff aren't overly friendly and prices for drinks etc are expensive. You can find good that is amazing and reasonably priced. All in all a great day for both me and my son (15yrs) had a ball..... very clean and well organised.

review_381638029,“Splendid Theme Park!”,"Bought a triple attraction ticket for SGD 110/-. This included the cable car sky network + S.E.A.Aquarium + Universal Studios : all unlimited rides. Universal Studios has 6 sections, namely : Madagascar, Far Far Away, The Lost World, Ancient Egypt, Sci-Fi city and New York. Each of these sections has many rides and attractions that will keep you at your wits end. A really unforgettable and enjoyable experience.Check the weather before going because some rides will not operate in inclement weather conditions.

review_381584580,“USS Visit”,"Good to purchase the tickets before hand, some places do sell them at cheaper price eg. Changi Airport Attractions Counter, hostel, etc. Strongly advise to get Express tickets to save time queuing up, but Express tickets can only be purchased at USS. Do take note not all rides provide Express lane service, good news is most popular rides do.Long queues start to form waiting for entry into the park before the opening hour, fortunately they are cleared quite quickly once the park opens, so hang on and don't rush. Most thrilling rides : Transformers, Cyclone & Human Roller Coasters, Mummy.Children will love Madagascar & Sesame Street rides, and the Sesame Street musical show. The 4D Shrek show is worth watching. The ride on the Lost World will get you quite wet, including your shoes! Don't forget to go for the Steven Spielberg Studio, the entrance is not so prominent and inviting, but it certainly is a show not to be missed. You have to put all your bags and loose items in lockers for Rollor Coaster & Mummy rides, rental is free of charge for the first 55 minutes. But the locker at Lost World is chargeable at SGD$4.00 (yes, not free!). Duh... I cannot understand too.

review_381532958,“This is a must when visiting Sentosa”,"USS is a place of wonderment and joy.... having never been to a movie themed park before, we found the experience one we will never forget. An express pass is a must if you only have one day to get around the park, it will make your experience more enjoyable.... BUT BE AWARE FOR LITTLE KIDS THE EXPRESS RIDE IS REALLY ONLY GOOD FOR SPAGHETTI RIDE/THE SHOW/MADAGASCAR, the ride near the Mummy ride, no longer has express which would be disappointing as it would be a littles winner. The other ride eg/ merry-go-round, always has seats.Grab an events of the day flyer and aim to be at Waterworld... grab lunch and take it in, its a great spot to watch and eat!! We love universal...

review_381523014,“family visit”,"Universal studios is not very big, you could get around it twice in a day easily doing all the rides. We did not do the big roller coaster as we were with our young children, but we did most of the other rides, kids loved it and we had a good day out. Get the fast pass or by late afternoon you will take ages to get on the rides.

review_381520169,“Enjoyable place if you have patience”,"This is one of the most popular attractions is Singapore especially if you have kids. Singapore weather is hot so try not to visit in summertime or if you have no choice, bring a hat and sunscreen. Another tip is not to bring big bags because they are not allowed in some rides like rollercoasters. If you need to bring one, there are lockers for rent. In our case, I did not ride because I am not fond of rollercoasters so I could watch our bags. Universal closes early on weekdays (7pm) and 8pm on saturdays. Try to be there early or you won't finish the rides. The lines are looong and some rides could close at thunderstorm warnings. If you have extra money to buy the fast pass, I think they are worth it because you can ride all you can without lining up. We should have done this! Next time we know better.

review_381330393,"“Day well spent - Minions, Human/Cylon, Mummy, Jurassic Park”","Went to USS in May during our S'Pore trip. Me, wife and kid along with Parents (65+). Got unlimited express pass for me, wife and kid. Got regular express pass for parents. The three of us would try a ride and then if the intensity was low we would repeat with our parents. We enjoyed all the rides / shows. Especially - Jurassic Park, Puss in Boots, Mummy, Human/Cylon, Water World. Transformers was a little bit of let down.Parents went to Madagascar, Puss in Boots, Shrek, Water World. Father skipped Jurassic Park due as he has a cardiac condition.Comparing to other Universal Studio's - Having been to USF, USH, USJ and USS - I feel the attractions are more modern compared to USJ which still features Back to the Future, Terminator etc. Probably at same level of fun as USH. USF still gives more bang for the buck because of Wet'n'Wild and Islands of Adventure.

review_381317609,“Exciting Fun-Filled Day”,"There are a number of attractions in the park but amongst the favourite is the Canopy ride and Puss in the Boots ride. They are not the daredevil type ides but gentler and scenic type rides but still exicting. The making of a Category 5 hurricane in Lights, Camera and Action theatre is also interesting and imaginative. There are a number of food outlets within the park and bringing in outside food is prohibited. There are also a number of restaurants and cafes within 100 metres outside the park which are open till late night where one can have dinner. Official photos with characters taken by park staff are generally expensive to purchase but the staff will also be happy to use your camera to help take photos at no cost. Plain water is permitted to be brought into the park and you can replenish water at several water points in the park at no cost.

review_381170070,“Best vacation trip with young children ”,"We went to Singapore to celebrate our only daughters 7th birthday. We spent one day at the USS. We reached sentosa by a cab and got tickets directly at the USS counters. I was first hesitant to pay SGD50 extra per person for the express pass as it amounts to INR7500/- for the three of us. But finally I took it and it's the best thing I've done. The wait time for popular rides was upto 180 minutes also. And we got them done in like 10 minutes. So I recommend the express pass if you really want to enjoy the rides or else you'll get stuck up waiting for hours to gether. Summer afternoons can get really hot so be prepared. The best rides 1. Transformers - amazing. Don't skip this. 2. Cyclon & Hunan roller coasters - must do for the adrenaline junkies 3. Jurassic park Rapids - do it for the experience of being transported to the Jurassic times. Rest all were also good. Food court was as usual like any other park. Over all must go with kids. And TAKE the express pass

review_381109091,"“Finally got to visit, and it was great!”","My wife and I have been waiting a long time to visit USS and we finally got the chance after 2 previous attempts. Seems we came during the Singapore school holidays, but not too busy. Transformers was really cool, and we actually went for it again towards the end of the day. A bit of a long queue for the Battlestar rollercoaster but lucky we bought the express tickets. My wife mistakenly left her camera in the washroom near the entrance, but thanks to your staff Cheryl and Grace at the Lost and Found counter we managed to retrieve it back. Really thankful for their reassurance and prompt follow up. We had bites at a few places. One was Goldilocks chicken, it was quite crowded and waited a bit long to queue. Our order was not complete as we had to wait for our side dish to be prepared, but the floor manager Siva really went out of his way to personally deliver the food to us and apologised for the wait. He was genuinely friendly. Ben and Jerry ice cream was nice but pricey compared to what we can buy outside. We also had the Chicken rice at the Discovery food court. Not bad but it's very expensive, especially as the meal is without drink so we have to pay another $4 for a drink. The floor manager Lesh was very helpful in giving us suggestions for what we wanted to order actually while we were looking at the menu, and it was nice to see him helping a older man carry his tray of food to the table while we were queuing to pay for our food. We left around 6:30pm after coming in at 11am plus, so it was really a whole day adventure. Generally all the staff around the various areas are quite welcoming and friendly, especially the staff at the Sesame Street shop. Although I think the staff who are escorting the dance group were a bit rude to those who wanted to take pictures (we managed to get ours but those behind use were cut off), I think they could handle that better. We plan to come back later this year, maybe in December. What a great time we had!

The waiting times for some rides were insane when we first arrived but as it got later these went done. Fantastic rides really well thought out. Also some good activities for all to partake in for example the special effects show. The only downside is that some of the queues for the rides go up stairs, these tend to not have air con/fans so can get very warm and stuffy so just bare that in mind.All in all a fantastic day out and well worth the money.

review_380115508,“Fun day out. ”,"i. Reached there about 1030. First thing is to walk around and plan where you want to go. ii. The Lost World opens at 1100. So we waited for it to open and did one roller coaster without queue before visiting Water World. - Strongly recommend Water World show. The first one is 1130, then 1300 then 1700. - If budget isn't a constrain, go for express pass so you skip 75% of waiting time. - Great place to bring your girlfriend or children (if any) o Water World was fun, mesmerizing, action packed and lots of stuns! It is a must to visit when you're in USS. Lots of pyrotechnics, it is live action movie!! You might get very very wet to very wet. Just bear in mind. ;)o Lost World was fun but the roller coaster was a brief ride. Try the hydroelectric one, you'll get abit wet but fun. o SciFi ride is the best of the best. Try the cyclon, much better than humans. o Transformer one was a 4D ride. Quite exciting if you're a big fan of transformer.o New York and Hollywood are well done. Beautiful. o Castle of Far Far Away is magical. More for kids though. o Mel's Drive-In girls are gorgeous and adorable. o Classical cars! Men's favorite! o Interesting ancient Egypt. Although we didn't manage to get a ride there. x Long long long queue. We waited for 2 hours just for the <2 minutes cyclon ride.x No one is hyped about Madagascar anymore. x Be prepared for expensive food. :)x One day is enough to play 65% of the whole USS. You probably need 2 days and express pass for 100% experience. x We experience two short delays during the wait. One for transformer and the other for Cyclon ride. Delay added up to be almost 40 minutes lost. :(

Some rides like Transformers and roller coaster can be almost 2 hours wait in line for a 10 minute thrill. McKinsey Consulting that did research for Universal Studio is correct to introduce premier pricing for express lane. Pay bit more for your express lane ticket will allow more rides in one day. A cheaper ticket which allow only 3 good rides in one day actually makes each ride more experience as one is trading your time.

review_379570960,“Family trip to USS”,"We visited USS on the Friday before Singapore School Holidays started with our 5 & 6 year old. We purchased our dated tickets online (including express passes). It was quite busy in the morning becoming busier over the day, but easy to enter and find our way around. It is quite easy to walk all around the park, everything is close by. We spent most of our time in the Madagascar and Jurassic Park areas for our kids. They were able to go on most rides accompanied and enjoyed all of them. Some parts of the park open an hour or so after entrance time, so be aware you may have to come back later for some rides. We used our express passes quite a bit as the day went on as some queues were up to 1 hour and it is very warm/humid. Definitely take hats and sunscreen and plenty of water. We ate at the Marty's Casa Del Sol food court which was very reasonably priced. We easily spent the whole day there which was very tiring, but enjoyable.

review_379417780,“I want more!!”,"My second time in Singapore but my first time in Universal Studios Singapore. Ok, so my goal for the day was to try Battlestar Galactica and Revenge of the Mummy. It opens at 10am but we got there at around 11am. I would suggest going there at opening time to make the most out of it.We took note of the outdoor shows we wanted to see but then, it proved to be useless later on. Due to the haze and a little rain, they cancelled a lot of outdoor shows and closed some of the outdoor rides. Bummer. Our first stop was the The Rockefellas show at the Palace. We stayed for the show, took pictures at the Met steps (feeling Gossip Girl!) and then went to TRANSFORMERS The Ride. Transformers The Ride was so painstaking. We queued for almost 2 hours. 2 freakin hours. We wasted so much time!My friend who didnt come with us to the ride was able to see Betty Boop and the Mel's Dinettes show. We went to the Puss in Boots' Giant Journey ride next. There it is again - the long queue! I honestly thought that because it's a Monday, there won't be a lot of people, but we were so wrong! It's like a mini roller coaster and it was quite fun.After the ride, it was almost time for The Dance of the Magic Beans show so we stayed in that area. We decided to have lunch while waiting. Then, a few minutes before the show, they announced that it was cancelled. Huhu. My other friend went to the souvenir shop and only saw a glimpse of Puss. Why is he so elusive?! When she got back, we went to the Donkey Live show instead - which was really really funny! It's very interactive and I'm sure the kids had a blast!Right after that, we rushed to the Water World but when we got there, they announced that it was also cancelled. Dammit. I was actually looking forward to that show. We heard so many good things about it. Huhu.We went to the Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure next. We brought our own rain coats with us so we were soooo ready to get wet and wild! The queue was super long so my friend and I decided to do the single rider thing. We were right in front, in a snap! While waiting, they kept announcing that they might close the ride due to weather conditions. We kept our fingers crossed but then after a while, they announced that they're closing the ride. Huhu. Not wanting to waste any time, we went to Revenge of the Mummy instead.Again, we took the single riders queue. We still waited for quite a long time but luckily, My friend and I were still on the same train. She was right behind me. Ok, this ride could've been pretty scary if it wasn't too dark. It was just ok for me.After this ride, we went back to Jurassic Park and yaaaay, they have re-opened it. This time around, there weren't a lot of people yet so we took the regular queue. We entertained ourselves by gossiping about the people around us. Ok, of all the rides we've tried, I probably liked this the most. I didn't have any expectations because I was thinking, this is just going to be like EK's Rio Grande. But there was a part where we thought, they were going to drop us. They actually did, but sideways. But totally love that feeling when you are unsure of what's exactly going to happen. So yeah, that's why this is my favorite. We didn't have much time left so we thought of just going around, take pictures everywhere. We went back to Battlestar Galactica but the waiting time is still 60 minutes. Seriously, the park is closing in an hour! Ain't got no time for that. Would have loved to try this though.We went to the Madagascar zone since that's the only part of the park we haven't visited. We rode the Madagascar: A Crate Adventure because there was no queue. It's just like Disneyland's It's a Small World. But OMG, there was a surprising twist! The falls!!! I hurriedly looked for my rain coat inside my bag, then it stopped. Seriously - that almost gave me a heart attack!!! We took a very quick photo op around the remarkable areas in the Hollywood zone. I think I like the Far Far Away zone the best! Super love the photos we took there! We went out before 6pm because we don't want to go with the influx of people exiting USS. All in all though, it wasn't so tiring because it's a lot smaller than Disneyland. I didn't feel like amputating my leg afterwards due to the pain. LOL. Wanna go back though to try the other rides! :( Maybe I'll purchase the fast pass next time!

The rides were great especially Transformer and Jurassic Park and be prepared to get a little bit wet for the latter.Even though the theme park is small but still need at least a whole day to fully enjoyed all the attractions.Highly recommend to buy the express pass as it will save a lot of waiting time. Some attractions need at least 60 min waiting time. Imagine all the time wasted waiting in line. However be prepared to feel a bit cheated as the express pass is not valid for all the attractions. Found this first hand at Treasure Hunter, Canopy Flyer and so on. This is a major let down as we paid so much for express pass but end up waiting in line.

review_379274933,“Wholesome fun and entertainment”,"1st imp point- Buy your tickets preferably online. Look out for many websites which offer discounted entry fee. Even the Resort world Sentosa has special offers. If you are going with kids you need to plan the rides in advance as they have rides with height restrictions. The express pass is very helpful as you dont have to wait in long lines. Dont miss the main rollercoaster rides. Meeting Shrek got a bit uncertain. Their program showed that Shrek meet and greet will start from 12.20pm till 5 pm. We kept waiting as my daughter was very keen. Shrek and Fiona finally came out only after 4pm. There are many eateries but quite expensive. You need an entire day only for Universal studios

The queue for some rides can be very long. Suggest to purchase the Express Pass which can reduce queueing time. Some 4-D shows are quite interesting just like riding the movie. Characters photography can be quite long queue for popular ones. Visited the studio at night once, it's pretty colourful too.Enjoyed. A whole day needed for first timer to the park (10am - 5pm).

review_379063951,“A Day Full of Fun with Express Pass”,"First, when you plan a trip to Singapore, make sure to include Universal Studios in your agenda. I was fortunate enough to have visited several times but it was the most recent that we opted to use the express pass. This may have been the best decision we have made. Although you pay premium price for it, the benefit outweights the cost and really ads so much value on your visit. Plus, the most valuable benefit of the express pass is your time. 5 mins on queue was the longest we had to wait as opposed to an average of 90 mins. When you are travelling and have limited time to spend, I recommend getting the express pass and this will give your a whole lot more adventure in one day. You can finish the best rides in a matter of a few hours rather than spending your whole day standing on queue.

review_378517728,“A perfect place to embrace your inner child”,"I went here with my cousin and we had a lot of fun. One of the best themed amusement park! If you are an adrenaline junkie then you should try the roller coaster. Universal Studio Singapore has 2 adult roller coasters, The Cyclone and The Human. I tried both of them, but The Cyclone was way scarier and definitely more fun. You also should try transformers (it's a must), the mummy (also a must), and jurassic park rapid adventure (buy a poncho if you don't wanna get wet). If you come with children then i would recommend all of the above except the mummy and of course adult roller coaster. Shrek 4-D adventure, shrek junior rollercoaster, and water world also great attraction for children. USS was very crowded on holiday season, but the upside is sometime they have a special event or parade during a holiday. And i wouldn't recommend for elderly people. In USS, you also can take a picture with the mascot, like minions, elmo, betty boop, shrek and tons of other mascot. The merchandises were cute and unique, but kinda overpriced.

Took the sentosa express from Harbourfront MRT which gives good photos from the top.Food entry to uss is restricted even though it is for kids only.you need to purchase SGD 15 locker for 1 day if you plan to spend entire day.Too much crowd for the major coaster attractions such as galectica, transformers,jurassic park etc.Waiting times stretch to almost 1 hour + that too on weekdays.You cannot complete all the attractions even if you spend whole day. They charge for additional lockers once inside for few roller coaster rides which could be easily managed by having free counters near the rides.Overall you end up standing for long times waiting for the rides.Food options as usual are costly inside the park.

review_378164873,“Getting the Express may be worth it”,"We visited USS on a Monday. It was still pretty crowded (maybe due to school holidays). The average waiting time from the time it opened to about 1600 hours is 60mins. The waiting time started to reduce to an average of 20-25 mins after six. We wasted so much time just waiting in line for the rides. It maybe better off topping up/getting tickets with express access to rides. After all, we only managed to cover probably 1/2 of the whole park over six hours or so. The park is clean and well maintained. We felt the closing time could be extended to about 9pm or so. It is just too early for a theme park to be closed at 7pm (during school holidays) or on normal days. Extending the closing time allows guests to take a rest in between rides and I believe that will enhance the experience further.

review_377843797,“Awesome”,"Simply Superb. Only advice but your tickets online or from Changi Airport. Trust me you will save SGD 25... I did the same and got mine for SGD 70....so buy these tickets at the airport. Same ticket at Universal is for SGD 100.Good easy access from Singapore. Take the metro or cab to Vivo City and then take the Sentosa Express. First stop is Universal. Awesome place for everyone and for all age groups. Lots of eating options but very expensive and quality is atrocious.....But a serious Warning: if you want to do any rides then eat only when u are leaving from Universal. The rides will throw ur stomach in a weird zone... So don't eat at all at best an ice cream or two... Must do:Transformers Ride. My personal Favourite Check out the animation and hold on to ur seats cause u will fall.... ( Now let's keep that as a surprise)Two Roller coasters after the main Transformers rideEgypt one is crazy. ( Do not and I mean do not even think of eating before this one) Jurassic Park is ok. Just a tip incase one carries bags and needs to use the lockers. Keep the bags at the Egypt locker area those ones are the cheapest. Lots for kids to see and do.Food is terrible and expensive. Eat light and while leaving take the Sentosa Express come to Vivo and eat there has better food and more variety and quality is top Notch.

review_377832756,“Think before you leap!”,"I know it's Universal and you want to get there early and stay till they kick you out! But take a deep breath and hear me out. After 3 visits to Universal (1 in LA and 2 in Singapore), the best advice we've received and followed was - do the shows first and keep most of the rides for after 3pm. Before you frown, think about it - Universal shuts at 7pm and the waiting time for the rides reduces dramatically later in the day. Nothing says that better than our experience with the always popular Transformers ride. Every time we passed by that ride the wait was 60-120mins!! But we took a look after 4pm and it was 15mins; we did it twice in 45mins!!!So I would suggest you get in and soak in the atmosphere, grab a bite, do some shopping (if you have to!) and do all the shows you want. Do a few rides if the waiting time is sensible but keep the big ones for later. Enjoy!

Please note though, nothing is really open until 11 am. The only ride I thought was a waste of time was the treasure hunters ride, we waited 45mins for a 5 min ride. They should state somewhere at the entrance of the ride how long it goes for. Queuing for that long in that humidity is exhausting. Nowhere to sit and have a beer or wine, which seems to be in most places. Plenty of restaurants.

review_377471145,“Fun day at Universal Studios ”,"An action packed day full of laughing and fun, I definitely recommend booking the express pass, for us it was $30 and that got us into everything once which was more than enough... There was an alternative $50 pass which was unlimited. I'm glad we didn't get that as we didn't exhaust the pass we had. We agreed the ride of the day was the mummy, it was a real thriller. I personally really enjoyed the transformers ride and the waterworld show but beware.. When they say you'll get soaked, they actually mean it!I loved the street performers and my 4 year old loved the Sesame Street show. Bad stuff: You're not allowed to take food in and the options available are expensive and low quality. Queues are horrendous and because the staff are Walking the queues selling the express passes to people when they're vulnerable, even the express queues get longer during the day.... The trick is the get the express pass early and go for your life before the staff can recruit people......

We are a family of three ( two adults and a 4 year old).The lines and wait time at some rides are over an hour, so if you can afford it purchase the express pass to gain access to the express line.However please be careful if travelling with little kids like us. The plethor of INDIAN tourists who travelled to Universal Stiudios are rude obnoxious people who continually and constantly trampled our our little girl to get a head of the line. They do not respect personal space and hurt out little girl on countless occasions!!! The grounds are clean and have helpful staff throughout.

So, would definitely consider getting the express pass for the next visit (if ever). Was there from 10am-5pm, only got through half the attraction. Rain on that day didn't help and the opportunistic selling of plastic poncho (with staff suddenly popping out of nowhere) for $4 per pc dampen the mood further. For a place that is supposed to be HAPPY, most staff looked grumpy. It is easy to get a lost (especially for first timer) and staff prefer to yell. Some are nice but unfortunately thats a minority. Customer service training definitely needed.

review_377201393,“Fantasy Land”,"Its a small park ! but great for people who have never seen an American theme park with hollywood at its brightest. Location - In Sentosa . Best way to get there from the middle of the city - metro take the line to Harbor front get off at Vivo mall walk the 10 minute boardwalk and enter Sentosa for free ( or pay 4$ and wait in line to take the monorail - 3 min ride ) . Or take a cab from the CDB and pay $20SGD. Any way ! Pay 74$SGD for a full day pass - but a caveat there are waiting times ...loooong ones if you come late - try and be here by 10 am so you get to go quick . Start from the opposite direction ! New York , Transformers ( hands down the winner !) , roller coasters , more roller coasters ! and lots of Photo Ops - carry the camera for the best memories . Anything that can be branded and sold to kids is there so carry a heavy budget for souvenirs , t shirts , mugs , dolls, food , photo ops , popcorn ! If you have the money and not much time take the Express pass - most convenient ! just breeze past everyone else ! ( one mistake we made !) This is if you want to do Universal and Sentosa all in One day - else if you have all the time you need 5-6 hours only in here to really enjoy yourself . Food - plenty of options , the one near Shreks castle has great fried chicken , juices , burgers . Dont miss this one for a real taste of hollywood !

The water world show is a must - great special effects as does the special effects show (funny about that).

review_377130244,“Amazing Theme Park!”,"This version of Universal Studios is relatively smaller than of others in US and Japan but it still entertains you to its very best and at the end of the day it will make your day happy and complete.Feedback: What i just i did not like is that there was no option to upgrade to an express pass if you purchased the Singapore Tourist Pass. I think they should work that out next time rather than asking guests to pay in full for the express pass.I think they have to reconsider extending their operating hours. It's currently at 10AM - 7PM but i believe extended it 2 more hours will not hurt them. Tips: Get the Express Pass!! This will save you a lot of time and will enable you to cover everything in the park for the whole day. Buy your water before you enter this park to save some money!

Complete Transformers first, then mummy ride, then jurassic park ride, then shrek 4D and then others to avoid crowds. My review of the park - 1. Transformer ride is really awesome.2. Other 3 main attraction - mummy, jurassic and shrek is great. But average experience. Also to mention Spielberg show here.3. The roller-coaster rides are really awesome and daring one. Specifically the cyclone one as it also puts you in the inverted position - if you are not comfortable would suggest to skip cyclone and go with human roller coaster, as cyclone is definitely more difficult to adapt.4. Rest all so-so5. The water stunt show was closed when I visitedAs one of the main attraction was closed and jurassic park ride was also getting frequently closed, I felt disappointed. Overall my rating is average thats why.

A trick to earn extra income by park?Food is average, a lot instant food include restaurant. Better option is go out to have lunch and come back again.Ride often close for maintenance especially the Battlestar Galactica roller coaster.

The longest we waited was 30min at the big roller coaster. On average I would estimate that we stood in line for about 15 min on each attraction.

But it's my opinion that it's well worth a visit if you find yourself in Singapore and have the time.

Downsides: food and drinks were ridiculously expensive. The park is small and doesn't offer enough thrills for the fee it charges. I was lucky because I got to the park early and choose the nicest rides before it got busy but I did come across one situation where I had to wait really long to enter the Battlestar Galactica rollercoaster because the staff kept letting in Xpress pass customers first (they do pay for having priority access but why not mix regular customers with Xpress pass customers instead of not letting us in and pauze the ride untill enough Xpress pass customers have arrived). Transformers the ride and the revenge of the mummy blew me away, they were 2 awsome experiences. The most boring thing was the Lights, Camera, Action ride presented by Steven Spielberg.

review_376327072,“Tips to save money to make the USS experience value-for money!”,"Visits to theme parks are always expensive affairs. We want to have fun, yet not spend the equivalent of a budget plan ride to KL. I've been to USS a couple of times and I thought to share with everyone on how enjoy your time in USS and save some money as well to make the experience value-for money.Tip 1 - Bring your own drinks or use the water coolers at each ride. As expected, riding the coasters in a typical Singapore weather will leave you high and dry (pun intended). There are drinks on sale, but they cost a bomb (like at least $4 for a bottled water). Bring your own drinks, or use the water coolers conveniently located at each ride.Tip 2- Eat outside USS. The food in USS is exorbitant and way above the usual rates of Sentosa. However, you can save some money (at least $5 per meal) if you leave USS to eat outside at Astons or the Malaysian Street Food. Just remember to get the re-entry stamp so you can go back and enjoy the rides after your meals. Tip 3 - Go straight to the Transformer ride or Battlestar ride once you enter into USS at 10am, as both rides have notoriously long queues so save the time by going for those first! And remember to remove ALL your belongings before going into the queue because they will reject you if you have your keys/handphone on you! Tip 4 - Go during off-peak to avoid the crowd! Which brings us to Tip 5...Tip 5- Get the express tickets if you're going during peak season - i.e.weekends, public holidays, school holidays (June/Dec). Tip 6 - Look out for special deals. I got 50% off for my 2nd ticket due to a union card membership.Tip 7 - Plan your rides carefully so that the rides are within your travel route!Enjoy!!!

The most thrilling bits were the two drops of your raft on the waterfalls, and soon after you just want to go on the ride all over again. The other simulated rides were worth all the wait in the long queues, which was the only drawback, but they seemed to move fast so again no real problems.

If u plan to ride all the rides and watch the stage shows it is definently worth forking out the extra cash to purchase the additional ticket known as the ""Express Ticket"" on top of the normal price admission ticket. This ticket allows u to go directly to the Express Lane for all rides/shows which only takes a very short wait compare to the normal admisson tickets the line in que could be anywhere from an hour to two hours just for one ride..and try not to leave the park between 6pm to 8pm as the taxi que will be very very long..Have a Happy Fun Day...Good Luck.

review_375357796,“Certainly the most fun part of our Singapore trip”,"My wife and I visited Universal Studios - Singapore last year and undoubtedly this was the most fun part of our whole trip. We spent around 7-8 hours here and it was totally worth it. We took almost all the rides except ""Puss In Boots"" because there was a waiting time of more than 1 hour. ""Transformer"" and ""Revenge of the mummy"" are the most thrilling and not to be missed rides of this adventure/theme park. I repeat Do NOT miss these rides! Only one complain - food here is expensive and doesn't taste good. But still If you're traveling to Singapore for the first time, you should visit this place.

review_375319908,“Great park”,"The park is very well maintained. It's better than MovieWorld on the Gold Coast, QLD Australia, but smaller than the one in LA, USA. Unfortunately we visited on a public holiday and not only was it hot and humid but the lines were really long. Our highlights were Lost World and Far Far Away. Souvenirs were reasonably priced.

review_375291503,"“Proportionally sized, good for single day visits”","USS is naturally smaller than the USS in the US, of course. The country is smaller than Rhode Island so the theme park can't be that huge.It's sized just right for a single-day trip and you'll most likely get to try at least half of the attractions easily. The most crowded ones are often the family-friendly ones, which is normal for theme parks.Transformers, Jurassic Park Canopy, and Jurassic Park main ride are the longest lines, which could take 30min or so to queue.Getting an Express pass would definitely help and worth the price.Battlestar Galactica and The Mummy have much shorter lines partly because the machines can sit a lot more people per ride and less people are inclined to try thrill rides (esp young ones).Situated in Resorts World means you are not confined to USS food outlets as well. At the end of the day, you can dine in a lot of restaurants.Speaking of food, each segment of the park offers a different type of cuisine, which is great. From western to Indian to Chinese food, you have options.We're locals and we live 5min from USS and have visited more than 30x at least. My advise is visit on a week day, preferably Mon-Wed during non-holidays (Google ""Singapore School Holidays""). We have a season pass and whenever we go during a weekday, even Transformers ride has less than 5min queue and we just go over and over and over again.

review_374997900,“A trip highlight - made me feel like a kid again!”,"In order of my ride preferences: The Mummy, Cylon, Transformers, Jurassic Park Rapids, Human. We also enjoyed the 4D Shrek movie, and even the Donkey comedy show. As we were grown adults (25, 31 and 65), we got bored with the kiddie rides (Sesame Street and Madagascar river ride).We went there on a Thursday - got there around 10.30am and left after 7pm - but still it was not enough to ride all attractions (we haven't gotten around to the Lights Camera Action) and missed some of the street shows. There was also a thunderstorm warning that afternoon, so all the rides were shut down for almost an hour. Food options are numerous, albeit on the expensive side. We brought bottled water with us, and just refilled it throughout the day (there are a lot of water fountains around). I think, since it was a weekday, there weren't any long lines to the toilets, either. Tip: Go on a weekday (Tue-Thu) for shorter queues, and buy the Unlimited Express Pass (additional SG$50) to skip the lines. We first went on Transformers and the queue was 1.5 hrs long; after, we started lining up for Cylon but the queue time was 80mins+ by then, so we decided to buy the Express Pass - and there was virtually no waiting time, and we even got on the front seats of the roller coaster rides since we had ""priority."" Not all rides are covered by the Pass, though, so do first the rides included in the Pass, and if one still has time, the other rides. We were able to ride Cylon, Human, and Transformers twice. Also, if you can, bring an umbrella. The day we were there it was hot and sunny from 11am-4pm, and drizzled a bit in the late afternoon.

review_374746887,“Fun Filled Day for Adults and Kids”,"The place is great playground for adults and kids. You can literally experience the movies like Transformers, The Mummy, Battlestar Galactica, Shrek, Jurassic Park, etc. I recommend all the roller coasters, especially the Battlestar Galactica Cylon Roller Coaster, it is amazing! Too bad the waiting time is very long, especially for the popular rides can take up to 120 minutes! For Indonesians, be ready to spend some money on food, as it is quite expensive (food cost around SGD 5.50 and above, soft drink around SGD 3.5), to save some money on water, you can bring empty bottle inside and fill it at the many water stations around the park.

review_374719749,“Second time around”,"We were able to experience the place before during their pre opening promo. There were some rides that are still in the testing stage so there were some rebate given before. We also went with an elderly person on wheelchair. We were impressed with their service and accommodation to the elderly as they prioritize us knowing that the elderly is only limited to some rides. They will make sure that the elderly can still see the ride.This time, I guess with the full operation. We now are with 3 elderly. We are happy that there are still some priority given to them. They also apologized for us queuing the line for the photo with characters as they said we should just go in front. Though for roller coaster or fast ride, they would say that the ride is fast so told us to leave the elderly somewhere and we have to queue the normal line. Overall, it was hot but still fun.

review_374591188,“The whole family will enjoy this”,"SINGAPORE WITH KIDS : THE KIDDY TRAVEL DIARY2Share14ShareTweet0Pin0ShareSingapore With Kids : The Kiddy Travel DiarySingapore scrapbook cover 2I promised myself that this year I take my kids along in my journey and I am so glad I am being able to slowly bring them on the same page. I want them to experience the world as I believe nothing teaches better than travel and exploration. My elder son has created this entire travelogue on his own, so this one is through his eyes but my words.I have listed Singapore as one of the top cities to visit as a family and this summer we explored Singapore with Kids! But before I go further in my blog, I would like to mention that DO NOT plan to go to Singapore in summers ever!! It’s hot and humid and the sun just made us sick. I googled the time of the year that you should visit Singapore, something I should have done earlier when I planned this holiday. Our travel journey started from Chennai to Singapore so from one hot destination to another. Anyway, mid to end October is just a perfect time to head there.p.s. Singapore weather is humid and it’s rains here unpredictably, so packing some foldable umbrellas and waterproof footwear will be a good idea.Travelling within the city:We reach Singapore 2Singapore needs around 4-5 nights to cover the entire city. The good thing is that it’s very well connected with the metro and public transport.Taxis are cheap most places within 15-25 min and fare between 15-20 dollars, of course, it depends on where you are staying. Our stay was at a service apartment in Orchard street which was central.p.s.There is a Sentosa shuttle which is for free starts from Vivocity mall and takes you straight to Sentosa Islands. Alternatively, you can also take a cable car from Vivocity into Sentosa.Without much ado, here is our travel itinerary of Singapore which will help you to plan yours;Day 1: Singapore ZooWhen you browse for information you will realise that there are multiple options available like Jungle safari , Night safari and River safari for kids to experience at the zoo. What you may not realise is that they are showing you mostly the same set of animals in different settings, so don’t waste your money trying to do all. Mom had experienced the night safari earlier and this time, she decided that we should try the Jungle safari. While night safari is a unique experience but you don’t get to see many animals in the dark, it is kind of scary and still awesome. There are a variety of shows over there. Watch out! They might choose someone in a show and make you pet a baby python, and when you’re at it, two people bring a huge baby python, and you may wet your pants if they tell you to pet it. There is a place where your kids can play over during the jungle safari. I would say that the River safari is the best way to see all the animals. So choose which one are you going to try.Singapore zoo 2Evening: You can head to Clarke Quay, which is an entire with best views of Singapore and bars. While this is not a kiddy destination, kids are allowed and so parents can enjoy a few drinks. There is also a river cruise which you can take there.Day 2: Universal Studios.Located on the Sentosa Islands, this can take up your entire day, so best to maximize it with kids. The good thing about Universal studios the rides are not all ‘kiddy’, so you will enjoy them as much as your kids. The transformer 7D ride, the dinosaur water slide ride, and Steven Spielberg’s special studio effects are worth it. They also have certain shows which happen at fixed times at fixed venues like Waterworld again worth watching. One thing to remember is not to head to this place on a weekend or you will end up in long lines. We went on a really hot Monday at 10 am and still had lines.

We bought our tickets online back home and the day before we were on Sentosa Island so bought some express pass tickets (which we later realised we didn’t need at all because we managed to do all the rides without waiting too long – we went on a Tuesday). We headed to the big rides (Battlestar, Transformers and the Mummy) before the queues got too long and then worked our way around the park and went on everything else. We managed to catch the Waterworld performance and Donkey Live (which wasn’t that great) and then at the end of the day when we had done everything, we used our express passes to go on the Human v Cylon rollercoaster again. We had a great day out and although the park isn’t as big as the Universal in Florida, we still had lots of fun. There are plenty of places to eat within the park so you won’t go hungry but do remember to bring a bottle of water with you as it can get very hot walking around.

review_374098642,“Equally enjoyable: adults and kids alike!!”,"Definitely not to be missed during your Singapore visit. A full day attraction, take your time, reach early. Enjoy!The transformers, The mummy, and 4D movies together with the Jurassic Park ride are among my favorites. Try and carry water bottles, as it can get pretty humid in Singapore during the day, although the facility provides drinking water at few points, it's still worth to carry your own, especially for top ups.Try and avoid weekends especially Sundays, as the place can get pretty crowded with both locals and tourists. Quite a few eating joints inside, so food is definitely not too much of an issue.The place is vast, so prepare to walk, get your map early to know which all places you would wanna see; if you see long queues at any attraction, just move on and visit others. If you r not too fond of queues, get the express pass.Stay till evening for the fireworks, it happens usually around 06-06:30pm, worth the wait.Kids will just looooveee this place!

The Cylon was a really trilling roller coaster where our legs were hanging and Transformer was another ride that we enjoyed very much too.

We did not opt for the express tickets & the longest we waited was 45 minutes at the transformer ride.

Also if you are staying in one of the resorts world hotels on sentosa buy tickets to Universal at the lobby & you get an excellent discount. All in all we had a wonderful day

review_373923692,“Mediocre”,"I was expecting big things from Universal Studios - Singapore, I knew it wouldn't be on the scale of those in the US but I was expecting thrills and screams and a good day out.In the end, it only managed to fill the ""good day out"" criteria - there are a limited number of rides and most are either tame or stop short of being ""screamers"". The rides that I most enjoyed were the Battlestar Galactica (Human vs Cylon), Tranformers and Revenge of the Mummy. If you have younger/teenage children Universal Studios - Singapore would be a good place to go for rides that the whole family can enjoy, but as a couple seeking screams we found it a bit lacking.Alongside the rides, the highlight of my day was definitely ""Waterworld"" - this live-action show was laugh-out-loud funny and left us open-mouthed at some of the stunts. The cast members went out of their way to interact with the audience, and I can highly recommend that sitting in the splash zones was very helpful in cooling us down in the Singapore sunshine

review_373614318,"“Good Theme Park, but slightly limited ride Options”","We enjoyed our day at Universal Singapore. The kids were tall enough to do all the rides and we certainly did lots of rides during the day. I would highly recommend getting the Unlimited Express Pass. It is another $80 odd, but well worth it. We spend all day doing rides and hardly any time waiting in a queue. The rides themselves appeared to be extremely well maintained. The large rollercoaster was as smooth a rollercoaster as I have been on. So despite the fact I was only on the ride because the kids wanted to go, it was actually OK.The only slightly disappointing aspect is the limited number of different rides in the park. It is certainly a lot smaller than the likes of Universal Orlando. But we still managed to fill in the day.The shopping and eating in the park are as you would expect.A good day out if in Singapore.

You will really forget all your problems and worries for a day and just enjoy and bring out the kid in you. The place is big, so you really have to allot a day for the tour.

review_373262685,“Great fun”,"My boys are 3.5 and 1.5years old and both had equally fun rides accordingly. Strongly suggest getting the Express pass as waiting for 5 minutes must feel like aaages for kids like mine. It rained for 3 hours but we still managed to catch the 5pm Waterworld show which was mind blowing and then headed straight to the Sesame Street musical where both the kids had so much fun watching Sesame Street characters come to life. Had it not rained we would've been out by 5pm as the venue is not as big as the one in California. But due to rain, we went home right after dinner at the Chinese Bistro (not recommended by the way). Coming back to the hotel was a challenge, there is a half hour wait for a free skytrain to Vivo City, a long long queue for taxi so we opted for an-all-in luxury coach for 50 dollars with no queueing. The driver told us that even taxis would have surge pricing due to location (Sentosa Island) and would end up paying the same (not sure whether this is true tho). But having young kids after a whole day at the amusement park we figured it was worth the money. Would definitely go back again as the kids grow older and can go into many more rides (together). They only have ONE atm spot and ONE baby's room which is the same as any toilet baby changing station within the park. Bring a lot of cash, if you want to spend at the food stalls. Souvenir shops have special 10% discount for purchases over 20 dollars with Mastercard which I took advantage of.

review_373003961,“Rainy day but still Fun”,"Despite the rainy Saturday morning, we decided to spend few hours at the Universal Studios Singapore (USS), an amusement park that opened its doors in 2010 and that has attracted lots of visitors locally as well as from overseas.We have been there numerous times and the place is packed with a variety of attractions in its seven thematic zones: Hollywood, Madagascar, Far Far Away, Lost World, Ancient Egypt, Sci-Fi City and New York.The park is relatively small compared to its bigger brothers in Florida, California or Japan but, despite the size, it is still capable to give you thrills and enjoyment and, for few hours, let you forget the stress of a daily life.For a complete visit and to experience all the rides including the Hollywood Dreams Parade, the Stage Shows (Water World not to be missed) as well as the fireworks one need probably to extend the visit throughout the whole opening time of the park, from 10AM to 8PM (thought the park will close earlier or later depending on the calendar).The place was not crowded and we managed to take most of the rides with short queuing time. For some of the most popular attractions (Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, Revenge of the Mummy, Transformers: The Ride) you can opt for the ""Single Ride"" entrance that will bring you on-board with little or no queue at all (although you have to be willing to ride without your friends or family in the same group).Of course the place is at its best during a sunny day but even with pouring rain you can spend some time inside the numerous stores, restaurants and cafes or simply walking through the covered areas at Hollywood or New York, not to mention that once reaching the attraction's entrance most of the queue areas are indoor or sheltered.Since its opening, we have been visiting this place few times every year and we keep coming back; we have even decided to subscribe for an annual membership that, however, makes sense only if you visit the park at least 3 times per year.

review_372761716,“A great place for family fun”,"This was my second visit to Universal studios and I was pleased all of the rides were operational including the dual battlestar galactica ride. My kids (10 and 11 yr old girls) loved the mummy ride and the Human roller coaster. Go on these at the beginning and the end of the day as the queues get long. Also joining the single rider queues help getting on the ride quicker (without the fast pass option). My only gripe is with the lockers near the mummy ride as they are not laid out well and during busy times there is too many people there trying to get their stuff out of lockers. I was rammed in there for 10 minutes trying to unlock my locker and then missed the free locker period. The biometric fingerprint key doesn't always work. Thankfully the attendant opened the locker, he seems to be permanently there opening lockers though so a better system /layout should be installed.

The shows and atmosphere as well as the character meets and the few rides he was comfortable with were more than enough to fill in the day.

Keep a minimum of 4 hours to cover the studio. Start from Madagascar (simplest and sweetest) to far far away to the lost world to ancient egyptians (underground ride and was a surprise) to cyclops (more difficult one) to transformers. If you are taking the Metro then it will drop you at Vivo City mall. From there you can take the Sentosa Express or take a 15 min walk. Avoid going on public holidays/ weekends.

First you give the paper ticket at Vivocity and get a tab, then you exchange that at Universal to get the real ticket. The express ticket had a similar process in addition to the normal tickets. In the world of soft-tickets, this sounded like an overkill. We loved our day at Universal. Very well managed and clean.

review_372238456,“fantastic!!...thrilling!!! and absolutely!!!”,"This has to be the most exciting place in south east asia to visit for some thrilling excitement!!Hubby and i visited this place,and to tell you the truth we had an excellent time here,it was money well spent.We booked our tickets from RWS website and there was a Mastercard discount of 10% and they gave us 2 glass souvenirs!and you can also get your express pass for $50 as well.Please get the express pass,it speeds up things and you get to finish all the rides at a record breaking time.If you are staying in town,hitch a ride on the MRT that lead to harbourpoint at Vivo city mall.Of course you have the option of taking the skytrain to Sentosa which is about $4 per person.A much better option would be to head to the taxi stand and get a taxi to connect to RWS Casino for only $5,this is better and cheaper and minus all the hassle.Do the same when you want to get back to your hotel,take a taxi from RWS and get to harbourpoint at Vivocity mall and take the MRT back to the nearest point which is close to your hotel.If your hotel is a bit far off hitch a taxi ride to connect it usually comes lesser than $5 you save a lot on transport.As for the rides,if you have a short time don't go for Madasgascar and avoid Shrek 4D its a waste of time and really lame.Just head straight to Jurassic park and ride the rapids,make sure your items are waterproof as you get really wet in the rapids.Go for the waterworld show only at the end of the day.There is a kiddy dragon ride rollercoaster on the right somewhere after madagascar i think,try to avoid that too.Its a childs roller coaster but its really superfast for kids even.Basically everything in Universal studio is a roller coaster!The ""revenge of the mummy"" is really horrifying as they chuck you in the dark in a high speed roller coaster,be warned as its super scary and expect the unexpected!!!its definitely not for the weak hearted.We didn't go for the desert jeep ride,they said it was a slow ride for kids so we opted out of it and waiting time is 30mins.Transformers is another dissapointing ride with old faded graphics and some lame movement here and there with fake images of robots trying to get the so called car that you're in.The graphics are really outdated!!Do this only if you have absolutely nothing to do!The mother of all rides is the Battlestar galactica and Cyclon,the aliens give you a motivating inspiring talk on...""we must save the universe dear brothers and sisters,the time has come ""...and some bull like that,but its a whole load of fun!!...they launch both rides side by side and you meet halfway a few times screaming your lungs out!!...the cyclone just throws you out in mid air and you find yourself screaming OMG at the sky and staring at the sun for a few minutes,not knowing where you are!!!...great fun!Definitely not for the weak hearted!!Others like Lights,camera action is worth going for the sake of it.Overall if you do have time,do come back and get on all the other rides.We missed out puss in boots and other lame items.if you start at 11am,you can finish all this rides by 4pm with express pass.As for food,its pretty expensive,we had our meals at madagascar cafe and for a Briyani set which cost us singapore $16,its quite pricey for us malaysians even!every other meal or burger is minimum $10,so be prepared to pay.Lastly go for this experience and enjoy every bit of it!!

The rest of the rides are very ordinary, can be found in your own locality. There is not much 'theme' to this place, neither do you get a movie-feeling like in other similar setups. The arrangements are not conducive to handle the crowd. For example, the rock-climbing attraction has enough equipment to let 4 people climb, but only one coordinator. So only one can go at a time. The stunt show called water world is funny with random special effects and a special effects show 'hosted' by Spielberg looks very artificial. There's no point spending a whole day here, unless you are a ride maniac and confine yourself to four rides. I wouldn't go there again.

There are two types of Universal Express Pass, the one entry on each ride, and ride all you can, priced at 70 SGD and 90 SGD respectively. Express pass doesn't guarantee you no lines, but expect much much shorter lines. Even with an express pass, it will still take you a day to try out every attraction they offer. If you don't like to spend more for an express pass, try visiting around 4pm onwards, lines at this time tend to be shorter. Most attractions close at 8pm.Personally, I would recommend to save Galactica Cylon for last. It's the best ride they have. :D

Overpriced tickets but it is Singapore...Some of the rides were so awful that they honestly weren't worth the 15-20minute wait (without express pass) and we were glad we had the express pass because of this. We arrived early expecting the day to be filled with lots of rides but there are only 2-3 rides I would class as proper rollercoasters. I'd go to say I've been, but won't go again.

review_371340827,“Great Day Out”,"Universal Studio is an amazing place to visit with family. You can terms it as a composition of Theme Park and Virtual Reality Shows. All kind of ages are covered here. In a family Young, Adults and Kids everyone will enjoy different kinds of rides. Most recommended Water World, Transformer, Dinosaurs, Mummy, Light Camera Action etc. Take time to visit. It will take around 1 days to see it. Take some light food and water inside. Also, you can enjoy food from the restaurant. It is very difficult to express the experience of Universal Studio if you do not visit.

It takes the whole day and may be the tickets are also high, but its worth going for adventurous, fun loving people, and kids. Though aged, heart patients, pregnant women can visit the amusement park, but they cannot enjoy many rides there, which are the best thing there(transformer ride, and mummy ride). They also have a water show, its kinda live movie. That is just awesome. Actors are great. I would suggest it to teens, kids (aged above 5) and young people. Go for it!

review_371051682,“Great even for a couple of oldies.”,"I have wanted to visit Universal studios in Singapore not so much for the thrill of the rides but just to see the different worlds and how they were designed so I dragged my wife along for a morning of adventure. It was an amazing experience, so much to see and do and we even went on a couple of passive rides just to say where've done so. I was extremely impressed with all the worlds, they are very colourful, well designed with plenty of action and fun with many food outlets and souvenir shops. I was disappointed that Water World was closed for maintenance as that was the world I wanted to see the most, you could see a little from the outside. We saw Charlie Chaplin, Marilyn Monroe, the Minions an Egyptian Queen. I had my photo taken along side Vin Diesel and there was a great 60's group performing as well. Its exciting for all age groups with plenty to see and do and I can certainly see why its such an popular, important attraction for Singaporeans and tourists.

review_371050083,“It's not Disneyland but still fun ”,"We avoided the Labor Day holiday rush and found the park enjoyable. There are plenty of rides for big kids and adults but very few suitable for young ones. My 4 years old daughter tried the merry go round, the flying dinosaur, the treasure hunt jeep ride and the junior roller coaster and that was it. There are certain more rides for her age and height in Disneyland. The rides are much shorter too but since we didn't wait for too long it didn't bother us too much. Dinning options are plenty and it's typical theme park food. Merchandise is rather limited too. The Donkey show is disappointing with almost no real people cast except the host. The Sesame Street show is nice but still really short and not comparable to the shows in Disneyland in terms of size of cast and production quality. It seems this park is run with much lower overhead costs. It's still fun and a must do if you are visiting Singapore. Don't forget sunscreen and hats.

Go for the transformers and mummy rides first and then the galactica ones ,first red and then blue trust me.

review_370399134,"“Certainly entertaining, more the younger folk, though...”","We were collected from our hotel and taken to Sentosa Island for our tour of Universal Studios. It was quite different from what I expected, although we both enjoyed our visit. Starting off with a pleasant ride through 'Madagascar' followed by a somewhat hair-raising roller-coaster barrelling through 'Puss in Boots'. Wasn't certain that I was ready for more of the same!The 'Jurassic Park' ride was excellent, with a few nervy moments (for me, anyway), but the best was the river ride. Fantastic, but expect a soaking! A long queue to go on the ride, but wow, it was worth it. A must!Then a wander through the re-created scenes from some well-known movies, a bite to eat and then onto the monorail to the mainland and the SMRT to the city centre.

review_370393959,“Lifetime Experience!!”,"My second visit to Singapore Universal Studio was as good as the first one as they keep on bringing in new themes. Firstly i would suggest you to pre book your entry pass as there are online discounts available. Also if one has to explore the place in one single day then i would suggest you to buy the express pass as it saves on waiting time. The best ride is the space mountain roller coaster both the red and blue one. Next is the terminator coaster ride which is new and amazing. If you want you can avoid the Jurassic Park as the ride there are not much of interest also when you go there you need to buy a raincoat as its a wet ride. So if possible carry your own raincoat as its very expensive in the park. Also the food is okay.

review_370012923,“Day well spent”,"If you are visiting Singapore for a couple of days and you are travelling with teenagers visit to Universal Studios is a must. There are enough attractions for each individual needs, there are high speed rides and slow ones, full with action and adrenaline driven or very calm ones, than there are live shows, movies, restaurants, shops etc.As there might be significant crowd on top attractions It is well worthwhile to invest in Universal Express or Universal Express Unlimited pass that will allow you to skip queue (on average for rides it took us 30-45 minutes waiting, for other attractions much less) and enjoy in all attractions without any delay. It will be also wise to plan your visits according to weather conditions as there are numerous attractions that are closed in case of rain/thunderstorm, although there should be enough of attractions open even in severe weather conditions. One remark, it is not allowed to bring your own food in to the amusement park, but as there is plenty of variety and at affordable prices this is not an issue.P.S. Once again, invest in Universal Express or Universal Express Unlimited Pass

review_369747026,“Fabulous!!!!”,"The USS opens at 10.00a.m local time. Advice, buy your tickets online with the express pass. At the entrance, you will find the guest services where you should show the printout, passport and credit card used for the payment. You will then be issued with the entrance ticket and the express pass ticket. The crowd builds up through the day, but if you have the express pass you just walk into the ride/attraction. The rides are awesome, specially the 4D ride at the SCi-FI City (transformers), and the Human and Cyclone (roller-coaster rides). There are plenty of food options available. Do not miss the opportunity to meet the characters and remember to take a picture with them, you could meet the characters of Madagascar, Minions, Frankenstein, Woody Wood Pecker, The Sesame Street Crew, Charlie Chaplin and many more. The souvenir shops will have all types of merchandise and there are few caricature artists from whom you could get a portrait done (costs approx SGD 50 for a couple).

That means if I want to play 8 attractions I have to spend my whole day without going somewhere else. If you see a crowd of people, I recommend you to buy a Universal Express. It is a ticket for cutting the line.On the day I visited there, the photos taken by the Universal Studios cameras in the attractions were not available to be purchased, since all the photo booths were closed.The toilets are clean and available everywhere.Souvenir shops can be found everywhere.

My advice is don't spend the money and check the crowd levels first and if it does get busy you can always go out and purchase this. It is a small park compared to the USA and if you arrive by 10am opening time you will be down mid afternoon if it's a week day.Take a water bottle and fill up at one of the many drinking taps as this will reduce the cost as food is expensive in the park.Great day out for the family

review_369127520,“Excellent roller coasters!!”,"Great theme park. Similar to Hollywood but with enough variation to keep it interesting and make it worth the visit. Our favorite rides were the two coasters and The Transformer ride. Unfortunately Jurassic Park was closed on our visit. Food is typical of theme park fare and usual pricing. It did get very hot and busy during our visit but we did the big rides early with no wait and then spent the afternoon on the less popular rides or at the shows in the air conditioning. The park suits all family ages with lots for everyone. Our kids are 8 and 11 and loved it. Universal is right in central Resorts World. An easy walk from all the hotels at RWS. Best tip - get there at opening and go straight for the roller coasters and Transformer rides.

review_369121653,“Great attraction for the whole family ”,"We were there at 10am and the crowds were waiting for the opening. Be prepared for Long queue at the rides namely the Transformers,the Mummies, the Lost World. Recommended to get the express ticket for additional $30 and go early to take the popular rides first. Transportation is easy to go there. Just take the MRT to HarbourFront station then take the monorail at VivoCity 4th floor straight to Sentosa. The first stop will get you to USS.

review_369023500,"“Ogre, King Julien and Transformer..”","I love universal studio singapore , been here couple of times, and everytime enjoy my day..Sharing few tips to help readers plan their day..1) Pick up Map and Show time leaflet , which are placed right at the entrance2) queue for 4d Transformer ride first , later part of the day, it gets very crowded.3) set ride/show around water world show, it's worth watching, do not skip.4) post 5.30 pm , you can go for round 2 on Transformer ride , mostly there is not much queue at that hr.5) most importantly, plan show time/ rides in advance , to avoid missing out on anything ..Tip :If its raining , make way to :Far far away 4d movie show orDonkey live or Steven Spielberg show, cause rides and meet - greet gets suspended , and these are indoor activities which are carried on..

The attractions are awesome, I am not quite expert of amusement parks, but I had a great time from the beginning till the end, and that's all that matters. Queues are long, but there's no park without them, and the most of the queues are covered with aircon, a big pro in a place like Singapore. Looking forward to go back and enjoy some more of every attraction!

review_368876717,“One of a kind”,"USS is a must-go for travelers. The park covers a large area with a water body in the middle of the park.The Battlestar Galactica must be taken. At a height of approximately 14 storeys at the highest point, the 90 second ride will definitely get you your desired adrenaline rush. However, if you're not a fan of sudden deep drops or flips, I'd suggest you don't even attempt.The transformers 4D ride was my favourite. The sound and video quality, accompanied by the movements of the 'vehicle' gave me the feeling or really being part of Transformers. There would be water sprinkler and heat waves during the ride. How to enjoy it most: Put on the glasses and never take it off during the ride, scream with the crowd.Revenge of the Mummy. It is a underground ride located at ""Ancient Egypt"" and includes rapid turns, acceleration and even falling backwards. It is a must-go for roller coaster enthusiasts.There is one water ride I strongly recommend for families. It is at ""Lost World"". The name is ""Jurassic Park Rapid Adventures"". You will get on a 9-persons raft, and flow through dinosaur habitats. However, be prepared to get extremely wet! (Bring a poncho along, some are sold there too!)The rides above are for people above 125cm, if you have young children, bring them over to the smaller rides at ""Madagascar"" and ""Far Far Away"". I won't go too in depth about those rides, but they certainly are all fun.One thing I don't really like are the prices of food. The food quality is great, however are twice the usual price in mainland Singapore. I recommend the pizza parlour inside the park, but alternatively, the Hard Rock Cafe and Chili's.Things to bring: 1) A bag. Your bag shouldn't be too big or it cannot fit into the lockers. Use a 25L haversack as an average. 2) Cash or a card. As I said, food can be quite expensive, so be prepared with enough cash, or bring a card to pay if you don't feel safe. Lockers are free for first hour and a half, but if it exceeds that time you will need to be charged. So if you take note of your time, you should be able to save some money.3) Bring comfortable walking shoes. Be prepared to walk some distance. If you're planning to take all the rides, expect walking over 2km and staying under the hot sun for a whole day. 4) Camera. A good camera is good, but it's not allowed on the roller coasters.

For our 9year old daughter, she enjoyed most of the rides. She did not fancy the roller coasters so we were glad that 90% of the rides were to her liking. It was extremely warm when we visited. They should provide a mistifier where people line up to wait for the rides. The fans were no help since it was just blowing off very warm air. We hope they can improve on this.

review_368312521,“Worth a look”,"Visited here as part of a 2 day fun pass (visit up to 20 attractions & Universal Studios) for $141.90. So it was $60 on top of the normal 1-day adult fun pass. Usual price for this attraction is $74 adult, $54 child. Open 10am - 6pm. Located near Waterfront Station.If busy the Universal Express pass is worth it - for an additional $50 you get to jump the queues which can save considerable time given the wait to some rides is often around 45 minutes. You can see what it's like first and then buy a pass inside.Most of the rides were good - my favorite was TRANSFORMERS The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle. Unfortunately the Jurassic Park Rapids was closed during our visit. Shrek 4-D adventure was quite good. Most of the rides would be fully appreciated with or by young children.

review_368217692,“All time favorite!!! ”,"Wow, this is my favorite place in Singapore.. I have visited this place about 3 times during the past 2 years and still want to go more. My favorites are the transformers ride of course, then the amazing in door roller coaster mummy returns.. Why the new ride puss in boots also amazing and how to forget the shriek 4D experience... The Jurassic park is an awesome water ride where u should allow yourself to soak. From the shows the signature ones are the water world and the Steven spillburg movie making thing.. However the sad thing is that if u go on a weekend or during school holidays the queues for the ride may be 120 minutes long. However the timing near the queues are accurate. Sometimes it feels not so good to stay in a queue for 120 minutes to enjoy a 60 seconds ride, but for me it's worth it. The shows like shriek 4D, water world and Steven spillburg doesn't have any lengthy queues as one show can accommodate big numbers. The red and the blue roller coasters are a must try and sometimes you may never wanna try roller coasters after the red ride... This is a must visit if u r I. Singapore and of course all time favorite of mine!!

This was the only place in Singapore where i saw western food joints being so affordable.The rides and the attractions are well maintained. Make sure not to visit this place during summer holidays or other school vacation time period.. Lots of families and schools with kids leading to longer ques :( But in such cases the express pass is worth investing in. Or else decide to go solo que (single line) and ask all your friends in your group to do the same. Trust me its better than waiting for an hour to go on a ride.Visit to Universal studios is a full day worth fun. If you want to see other attraction of Sentosa, you need to come back again and cannot be combined with the day you plan to visit Universal.For kids the best part of visiting Universal studios is not the rides but the photo opportunities with the characters..Those will be the best memories..

review_367986035,“Fun Place for the Family”,"This is the first time we visited USS as a family. It was worth it for us to get VIP tickets, this made our day at USS pleasant and enjoyable. The VIP tickets allowed our kids to maximize the day by not needing to wait in line for all the rides. VIP access allowed them not only to skip the line but also allowed them to have the choice what carriage to ride, in front of the coaster or at the back, or in the middle. In some rides they were able to do it twice at one time when they wanted to. Having our own tour guide really helped a lot, we did not need to plan what to do anymore, and our kids had an instant adult companion in the rides, my wife and I got to relax and enjoy seeing the kids having the time of their life without suffering the need to accompany them in rides that were no longer enjoyable to us! The VIP tickets also came with S$25 food vouchers that we used for lunch and dinner! We opted to have the 5 hours guided tour from 10am to 3pm, I think this is a good choice since it gave us free time from 3pm to closing time to just wander around USS and repeat the rides the kids wanted to. Also at 3PM we watched the parade from a good vantage point reserved for VIP ticket holders, this area is cordoned off so that it won't be too crowded. One must see is the water world show! Just be careful where you seat if you are not ready to get wet!An additional note, Saturday's are a good time to go, although it maybe crowded but it is during this day that there is a Hollywood parade at 3pm and a firework display at 8pm.For first timers at USS, getting VIP tickets are worth it to maximize your stay and experience.

review_367097295,“If its family time in SG then it cant be completed without Universal Studios Singapore”,"My first visit was on 2010 and from there visited couple of times and below is what i suggest for my readers based on my experience. Foreigners, travellers, backpackers, couples, family or who ever is not a resident of Singapore must check USS - (Universal Studios Singapore) website event calendars before visiting. Because most of additional event like Hollywood Dream Parade or special event happens only on Fri, sat & Sun. And you know what that's when it will be over crowded too...! Still don't get disappointed as you really need to plan your day properly if visiting USS. Ensure whole day is scheduled for USS and be early even before they open some where like be present by 10am. Relax and make sure you are the last person to walk out until they close cause you have to cover all attractions inside. Based on my experience as soon as they open USS rush to Transformers ride first cause queue will be crazy. Next go to Mummy ride then Jurassic Park. For Jurassic park if you don't want to get wet try to get a $2 raincoat some where in health & glow or Watson's shop. Cause it's cheaper outside and expensive inside. Then try to cover water world live action - sure this one not to be missed especially within time. After that come back to lights, camera & action. Then on go towards Far Far away, from here you may go in order to one by one to cover all attractions. As you follow in order you will be again back to entrance from there ensure you cover all other missing rides. Because after opening USS you were rushing to transformers...! Don't worry by that time as attractions you will be missing as you head towards transformers cause you will be covering them later.If any of the order is missed believe me you wont be able to cover USS completely and for sure will be disappointed as you missed some rides. Atlast you cannot complete your Singapore Trip without USS. Am sure this will help you a lot. Happy travelling ...!

My personal favorite is the mummy themed one. If you are not a big fan of roller coasters, you can also come here and take photos with your favorite movie characters and watch other shows and performances. The staff at the photo booths are really nice. They always help you to take photos with your own phones and give you various ideas of poses. I had a wonderful day with my friend. You can get cheaper tickets at certain travel agencies.

I wait for 45 minutes for transformer rides and it's only less than 5 minutes to enjoy the game. seriously, it's not worthy waiting. the Jurassic Park ride were closed because it's repaired and the Battle of Galatica rides is closed at 5 pm for cyclone side. I suggest to bring a lot of drink cause the weather is hell HOT and the price for drinks is too expensive. if you want to eat, I also suggest to have your meals before or after entering USS which is in Vivo City. They had good food with good price. since the price for food at theme park always unreasonable.If you need to play in here, you must have a lot of patience because the queue is always there in every rides that available.

review_366720996,“Great day out”,"We have two teenage boys and decided, at the last minute, to give them a surprise treat and take them to Universal Studios. We've been all but one of the Disney theme parks in the world as well as the local ones on the Gold Coast. Although Universal Studios isn't too dissimilar to the other theme parks, we felt that it had something the others didn't. The rides were great and my thrill-seeker sons and husband really loved the Battle Star Galactica ride and I enjoyed the ones I was game to go on. I was slightly annoyed that I didn't have my passport with me as this was needed for the rock climbing attraction. This should be advertised somewhere (and if it is, should be advertised more clearly). The food was great value and good portions - way better value than any other theme park I've been to. If you've finished your sightseeing and want a fun day out with the family, I'd highly recommend Universal Studios. We were lucky to be there on a Friday, so the queues weren't too long and rarely waited more than 10 minutes.

review_366630133,“Really not worth the hyoe”,"We went on a weekday as suggested in other reviews. The place was still crazily overcrowded and any of the outdoor rides were closed for a good few hours due to lightning warnings.Most of the rides were lame and certainly not worth the queuing time. However, we did enjoy the Puss in Boots mini roller coaster- our 3 year-old son really enjoyed this. Also the Jurassic Park Rapids ride is great fun.I would strongly suggest bringing plenty of drinks as the day will be long and humid and the drinks, like everything else here, are ridiculously expensive. Most of the staff look harassed and bored and quite unhelpful with directions to particular things in the park. The highlight was the Steven Spielberg movie experience but like all the rides here it did not last long enough to properly enjoy.Honestly, if you don't go, you aren't missing much.

review_366539218,“Universal Studios - reclaim your childhood fun”,"In April we visited Singapore for a week - What an amazing city. High on our list of to do was Universal Studios. The weather was hot so a water bottle and hat is a must - if you can get away without a bag to carry around do this or you will be packing belongings in lockers or leaving them on exit counters / I carried a small zip up bag with a string handle about 10cm by 8 cm and simply wore it around my neck and tucked it into the front of my pants - it contained my mobile phone and my money and my train card - the MRT card that you buy at the railway station and load money on. To get to Universal Studios we caught the train to Harbourside then a monorail trip to Universal. We also paid an extra $50 for express passes so that we did not have to wait in queues - these ended up being amazing as we did not have to wait in the heat at any time. We headed off straight to the transformers ride - loved it - then Human vs Cyclon an amazing roller coaster - wow!!!! Revenge of the Mummy is not to be missed and Jurassic Park Rapids ride also even if just to cool you down. Then you will probably want to do these again a few times if you are an adrenalin junkie !!! Many more nice rides and theatres and look out for Fiona and Shrek they are sure to want to give you a cuddle in the land of Far Far Away. Lunch at an American Diner or any of the food outlets and street dancing and singing - so so much to do. Afterwards as you head out it is only a short walk to an amazing aquarium that shouldn't be missed - have fun

review_366480631,"“Only a few great rides, Water world show is a must see.”","Best advice i can offer it to visit this place on a weekday and preferably off season. I was excited to visit Universal studios after many recommendations however the thing that scared me the most was the long wait times for rides, luckily we never had to wait more then 10minutes for a ride! we arrived at 10am for open, the one downside i have is no one tells you if you have a fun pass you need to collect a ticket first then line up. So many people waited for so long only to have to re join the lines after getting a ticket. not one staff member said anything or any sign's. We were lucky enough to go on all four major rides in under an hour. The transformers ride is pretty cool , i suggest try getting a seat at the front as it is much better for effects. The Human and cyclone roller coaster were great, however the Human one was pretty boring. Other then those and the Mummys revenge and Jurassic river ride theres not much more in the way of exciting rides. The water world show was amazing, sit up the front to get soaked on a hot day. The crew were fun and got the crowd involved. The effects were really great to see, i highly recommend going.

Difference is that the themes here are of universal movies instead of Disney. Going during CNY was an issue as all rides were over crowded and waiting times ranged into hours.

The 45 min queue for the Transformers ride was air conditioned and, surprisingly, entertaining. The ride itself was fantastic. Our last stop for the day was Ancient Egypt, the ride was thrilling and tge special effects took us straight into Tomb Raider. Our boys cleared the height restrictions easily but even when we climbed into the ride there was nothing to warn us that this was a hectic rollercoaster....more thrilling than the outdoor ones because of the special effects. A little more than the regular health warnings would have been good. And, the food at Jurassic world is terrible. Throughout the park food, water and other drinks are seriously overpriced. Otherwise, a great day out.

At least their Elmo ride was super cute. If you are on a budget, pack your own lunch.

In spite of going on a Tuesday, we ended up spending about an hour in the queue for most of the rides. It reduces the time drastically when we go as a single rider. Better to have two days to cover everything. Transformer and Mummy are the two best rides. Though I went in for Transformer, I didn't have courage to go in the Mummy ride, it being more like an advanced roller coaster. We had a great vegetarian meal at the Ancient Egypt restaurant. Don't be fooled by looking at the queue outside Transformer. There are rooms and rooms before we actually get to do the ride and it might easily take an hour to get to the ride.

review_365962679,“Cyclone & Human Rides are a must”,"Universal Studio is one of the best amusement parks based on a theme of Hollywood movies. We were able to cover most of the park as we visited during a weekday! So here is what I did -1. Hollywood street - is nothing much to do, rather it is a place to shop/eat/click pictures. There is a store called the universal studio store where you get souvenirs of all the themes based in the USS.2. New York - Again a lot of restos and well designed walls to give it a New York look. My favorite part was the 'Lights Camera Action' and the 'Sesame Street Spaghetti'.There were also street shows which I couldn't make in time. I will not give away the details to avoid spoilers :)3. Sci-Fi - The bestest part was the Cyclone & Human Ride in the battlestar gallactica, these are roller coaster rides gives you an amazing head rush! Transformers is the second best in the whole USS. These two rides take your energy to a whole new level.4. The Revenge of Mummy - The third best part of the USS. A must do for all of you.5. The Lost World - Canopy, Rapid Adventure are the one's I would suggest here.6. Far Far Away - A beautiful Disneyland-like set. Very nicely designed buildings, feels like you are in a fairy tale. Shrek Movie is a must. Enchanted ride is also suggested.7. Madagascar - Nothing great about it. Crate ride gives you a nice ride of Madagascar island. Maybe a must do for Madagascar fans.We had food in China Bistro in the Hollywood street, decent food. Great atmosphere overall. Very bright and vibrant colours all over the place. Good luck with the queues. :)Tip: They almost always display a waiting time for all the rides, do not just get in the queue at once. Take a tour of the whole of USS, complete the must do ones if they have <15min wait time first. During the second round complete all the remaining must do's. If time permits take a third round and complete the ok-ok ones!

review_365900378,“Don't Leave Singapore Before Visiting Universal Studios”,"My husband and l were on a 4 night stay in Singapore over the Easter break. On our must see list was Universal Studios, Sentosa Island. Firstly many tour buses will get you there, we used the Duck & Hippo Group (see other review). I didn't time it but seemed like a 15 minute (give or take) ride to get there from the departure stop (Suntec City) which is one block from Raffles Hotel with plenty to see on the way. On arrival all transport enters through the underground drop off carpark with escalators to take you up to the central area with eateries, museums and yes Universal studios.Several packages are available to suit your needs depending on what sort of experience you want. We just bought general admission tickets at $74 SGD per person for a day pass which at todays rate would be $70 AU. There are several ticket booths at entrance but don't be dismayed by the long lines as they move very quickly with lots of willing staff to help guide you through. I noticed stroller hire was available as well. Before you go in grab a studio guide with map of layout and info which are available inside the gate as well. Very easy to walk around again with plenty of staff to assist. The themed areas consist of Madagascar, Far Far Away, The Lost World, Ancient Egypt, Sci-Fi City, New York & Hollywood. Now we didn't go on all the rides but a big hint if you go on the Rapids Adventure at Jurassic Park we waited in line for 1.5 hours yes 1.5 hours, no seats. It's set up like a cattle shed just lines and lines of people waiting. Go on this ride as soon as you arrive as the day goes on it gets longer and longer. WaterWorld was closed for renovations which was disappointing but Aussies should be used to that with our Qld parks. I just feel personally if people pay full price for the whole experience then thats exactly what they should get. I know maintenance works have to be done sometime but an incentive would have been nice upon purchasing tickets say a free snack & drink for example to compensate.Also be aware if your whole family are going on the same ride many rides do require you to put all your belongings in a locker before boarding so do this upon arrival taking only your money, phone that can be put in pockets securely. Lockers start at about $4.00 SGD and that gives you about 3 hours if l recall. They are all individual code access so no keys and are located at many ride entrances. If you go over your time it will simply ask you to pay the difference before disengaging the locker. Also chances are you may get drenched or not at all on this ride hence locking up bags but raincoats are available if you decide to take your belongings with you, also $4.00 SGD.One experience you should not miss is what it's like on a movie set with lighting, props and special effects show, only about 30 minutes but really fascinating. We did not eat inside Universal but chose The Hard Rock Cafe instead. There seemed to be an abundance of eateries to choose from though. Upon leaving Universal we decided to take the Singapore Cable Car back over to the mainland and catch a bus from there but upon reaching the ticketbooth we were misdirected not once but 3 times and basically got sent walking back and forth until we gave up( another review, no fault of universal) and jumped on the MRT. Communication breakdown to blame.Overall don't leave Singapore without spending the day at Sentosa Island, you won't be disappointed worth every cent. Happy travels.

Other than that it is a wonderful park with lots of fun rides for both small children and teenagers, lovely streets, nice cafes and of course the possibility of getting to meet and greet Disney characters.If you can afford it buy the Universal Express pass which lets you pass the queue on many attractions, or else most of your time spent in the Universal studios will be in a queue.

review_365638099,“Hot but fun!”,"Scorching heat on Sentosa Island at Universal Studios in April but still had so much fun. Several of the attractions are cool inside so that helps. Transformers the Ride, the Battle Star Galactica roller coasters (Human & Cylons), and the Shrek 4D were highlights for us. Also the movie set hurricane experience hosted by Steven Spielberg was quite fun. Plenty of rides (and most are family friendly), plenty of shows, food and snacks everywhere (including a Starbucks near the entrance), and an overabundance of souvenirs & memorabilia to buy.

It is full of adventure, fun and needs lot of adrenaline.Wait sometimes can be irritating, but u can always take the Express pass and jump the queue.Express pass can be bought inside at 50SGD per pax, which is definitely quite a cost to add on. But worth the penny if u interested to enjoy full.Keep your camera / selfie sticks handy. There are endless avenues to go click click click click..Best attraction is transformers.....

Hint: Upgrade to the Universal Express pass for an extra $50 per person. It will let you bypass the normal queues (between 45-90mins) and hop onto the ride in 5-10mins! Takes away the frustration and maximizes the experience.

review_365555527,“GOOD FAMILY DAY OUT”,"This was our 3rd or 4th time in USS. There has been no much changes since our last visit.. the show and rides etc are same. We went during Easter, so they had Egg deco everywhere and they had spl eggravagant show at additional S$10.00 per person on top of the USS tickets which i feel was not really worth it the additional cost.I feel they do need to keep adding new shows and new rides from time to time. The Q are long as usual and if you are ready to spend additional $50.00 for express pass, then will suggest u to do it as u can save lot of time esp in the rides like Mummy and transformer where the waiting time can easily be 1.30 hrs.On our visit day, we were lucky as in the morning it was pouring so the crowd was less so we managed to do many rides in 15-30 min waiting time but during the noon, it was packed again and then again we were back to 40-90 min waiting time. Try going on the rainy day..ofcourse u will get wet but atleast u can njoy the rides without waiting.The drinks / food are quiet expensive in the park, so be prepared accordingly. For reference small coke / can is $ 3.50 and big glass is 4.5$ , food set is approx $11.50.For water carry your own bottle and fill in..as there has drinking water in many places.My kids enjoys the rides so i guess we will surely get to visit again if we are in SIN.. I hope there will be more changes once we visit them again..

Luckily the day we got there, there was only 5 minute queues for each ride. The roller coasters were great. It is family friendly and the food court prices were very reasonable.

Only disappointment was the lack of photos when coming out of rides as we love to see our crazy faces, and have the option of purchasing the pictures. Transformers was our favourite ride which was so very unexpected. And the express pass was the most worthwhile purchase as we didnt have to wait in the hour long lines. When we were there, some outdoor rides were suspended for about 30 minutes because of lightening, however the storm didnt come. But I saw many people extremely disappointed as they had waited an hour to get on the ride only to get to the front and have it cancelled. Whereas we only had a 5 minute wait and at times not even that. They whole day was awesome.

The very first 4D Transformers ride is at the Universal Studios Singapore and it is simply exhilarating..! And the Mummy Roller Coaster is just unbeatable..! Went THRICE on the Mummy Roller Coaster and I still haven't had enough..! But the best part about all the rides are the queue lines. Regardless of the genre of the characters involved in the ride, every queue line will guide you through a series of events which gives you a good background on what the ride is about. Every ride is linked to a story, which is just fantastic. And to top that, what brilliant execution by the staff..! Would love to go again!!

A day out Endless thrills”,"Universal Studios in Sentosa is amazing and it suits for all ages to spend a whole day out with endless entertainment.It can be reached easily by the Sentosa Express Mono rail , by boarding train in Vivi city mall 3 rd floor level. I bought a 2 DAy FUN PASS( Universal Studio Oneday + Sentosa 20 Attractions included) for 139SGD online ticketing so i planned to spend first day in Universal Studios. On entering inside the Universal studied i was amazed to see the thematic entertainment of Madagascar , Jurassic Park , Egyptian Puramids , Transformers Si-Fi City. New York City and parade. Thematic restaurants and buildings were well decorated to bring out the vintage characters and places to life.I was really amazed on the thematic entertainments and really enjoyed a lot . Evening at 3 30 PM i witnessed the spectacular New York City Parade , with cartoons characters, Madonna, Chaplin ,  and vintage caracheters and artists dancing and performing on streets. Hollywood Stunts were performed in the amphitheater with real explosions and stunts fires and boats stromig inside water with real movie FX. The Jurasic park Discovery was amazing and thrilling with round about water coaster  floating and waters splashing.It was eyes captivating and there was variety of shows running in each theaters and at the evening got relaxed on the waterfront lake at 8 PM there was a spectacular fireworks in the lake and i watched it relaxing on the pavements.After finishing  my Universal Studio day out i came out and headed to Crane Dance show near the cause way front which is also spectacular with two cranes dancing with splashing fountain waters and light effects.Crane dance show is free anyone can sit on the gallery and see and enjoy the show.

From hollywood zone to jurassic, from the mummy zone to madagascar zone. The place is not too big as the other Universal Studios, but 1 day is quite enough to play the rides.The most challenging ridea in here are the Mummy Indoor Rollcoaster and their dual ""Battlestar Galactica"" outdoor rollercoaster, Human and Cylone. Even though it looks very scary for some people, but I am very recommend you to try this. After feel the experience, I am not become scarrier but wanting to try again the rides. But remember, to try these, you need to use the free locker at the side of rides.For kids, the theme park also provide kids related attractions. From Minions to Sesame Street until the Madagascar Rides. You also can find easily thematic souvenir shop and collectible item at each stores.If you loves to have a challenging and entertaining attraction in Singapore, this can be a good recommendation for friends or family trip.

Children can enjoy far far away (Shrek) and other cartoon characters, while the adults can enjoy Mummy returns and jurassic park. One of the must do rides is the TRANSFORMERS ride. do'nt forget to do it as it might seem to be difficult from outside. If you want to enjoy the full park thoroughly, you should take a 2-day pass as 1 day is just not enough ! Indians will find indian vegetarian food in the middle east section, i.e. close to the mummy returns. Strollers are available for adults and infants on chargeable basis.

review_365005133,"“Avoid weekends, bags, bring iced bottle!”","It's easy enough on foot to get around the park. Best rides IMO: Transformers, Mummy, the roller coaster. You'll have to use the lockers to keep your things between rides or walk a giant round back if you rent one locker for the whole day (cheaper than renting one at every ride). I suggest pants with zippered pockets so at least you have cash for food/drink & handphone for photos without repeated walking. The lines took up a lot of time so do avoid weekends or you won't finish the park.Going back, I'd have packed a frozen bottle of water - so as the ice melts you get a cold drink and you can use the bottle to cool your neck as you get so hot and sweaty especially at the Waterworld show - also a highlight of the park. You may get a little wet at the Jurassic Park ride but that was so mild I'd rather have skipped the long queue and given it a miss. Nothing much to mention in terms of food. I'd rather have burgers in Hard Rock cafe outside the Studios, if you can last the day. Worth it if you bring the kids as I felt half the rides were child-oriented. A tall 12-year-old would be able to enjoy both worlds. Maybe a VIP pass would have made a better experience...

review_364736069,“Deafening and hot with no shelter”,"I am a theme park fiend and have travelled to loads around the world. Was very disappointed with USS because of 2 overriding factors. Firstly the noise from the speakers around the park is set to the highest volume so you can't hear the person next to you. Also the sound on the rides is the same volume if not louder and is so distorted that you can't hear it. This was the case on the puss and boots ride and even the Sesame Street spaghetti ride - our 4 year old actually asked to leave the park because it was so loud. This coupled with the heat and very little shelter unless you wanted to pay for extortionately priced food made for a very uncomfortable expensive and disappointing day.

Take a MRT train to Harbourfront MRT Station from where you get the cable car to Imbiah Lookout. Here you can get Sentosa Express and get down at Waterfront station to go to Universal Studios. From HarbourFront MRT station you can also get the Sentosa Express monorail and get down at Waterfront monorail station. Walk straight till you see Chili's Restaurant on your right. Turn right and head towards the Universal Studios Globe.We reached well before the gates opened and found long queues for entering the studios. This was mainly for reaching first at the rides. Rides are Madagascar, Far Far Away, The Lost World, Ancient Egypt (including The Mummy), Sci-Fi City (including Transformers) and New York (including Sesame Street). There are also shopping and dining options at various areas in the park.I went to Universal Studios with much expectation like real sets as in Universal Studios LA, but on visiting I realized that this place is only rides.

It was during Queensland school holidays just after Easter so was busy but no where near as busy as it could have been judging by the queueing barriers. We were disappointed to not go on the Jurassic Park ride but we just refused to wait 100 minutes in a line. If you can afford it, definitely worth the express pass in busy times, although this is VERY frustrating when you don't have one and watch so many people going straight to the front of the queue. The times stated at the beginning of each ride line are not always accurate, we waited an hour for a ride that had said 20 mins and only waited 20 mins for a ride that said 50?

All the popular rides were more than an hour of wait, some two. So we decided to get the express pass. Totally worth the money. You can use it for almost all rides, unlike most of the other parks that restrict only a few rides. We watched the parade in the afternoon. It's not good. Don't waste your time unless you want to sit for a bit. And if you will have your lunch anyways, sit at the restaurants where they have outdoor seats - front seats to see the parade. We didn't do that and it's dumb. We first sat on the side of the street thinking we would be the first row. When the parade started, everyone all the sudden stood in front of us to watch. Totally didn't understand why. So we had to do the same to see anything if we would. Hundreds of people squeezing each other in a hot sweating day.... Not very enjoyable.

review_364315349,“Live up to the expectation as signature attraction of Singapore.”,"We visited USS on 2/4/2016. The general experience is pleasant, given needed to mention that one may have to tolerate the frustration of queuing and waiting, and the competition with filthy rich fellow holiday goers who hold the express pass.We went on a non-holiday weekend, with the park operating from 10am till 9.00pm, and the operating hours is more than enough for us to play around the whole park. To our surprise, all rides are fairly easily available with almost no queue after 7pm. Hence, we got chances of repeating few good rides like Mummy revenge(twice, no queue), Jurassic park rapid adventure(twice, no queue), Transformer(single rider lane 3 times, no queue) and even Battlestar Galatica(5 minutes queue for Human side). Cylon ride is forever long queue. The most fascinating ride in the park is definitely Battlestar Galatica: Cylon. This is the best roller coaster so far in my travel log. Transformer: The Ride is very impressive as well, and I won't mention any spoiler. Just go try those 2 rides yourself, as these 2 are really true signature ride of USS. Food is quite alright, typically expensive for in-park dining but nothing special worth mentioning.In summary, definitely worth our visit. I would recommend this place to people of all ages, but need to be in good health.

review_364294708,“Must visit for little and big kids alike.”,"Writing this review after my second visit to USS. The first was in 2012, so I was excited to see any changes that might have occured!We took the MRT to Vivo City and enjoyed the walk along the Sentosa Boardwalk to get in. Lucky for us we chose a day that was slightly overcast and a few showers were forecast- which I think scared a lot of the locals away! We probaby got rained on once or twice but it was just a sprinkle, and we welcomed the cooling mist after spending a day in the Singaporean humidity! We were going to buy ourselves express passes at the gate to skip the queues- but we didnt need to! We got on most of our rides within 10 minutes waiting. The longest wait was the Human Vs Cylon rollercoaster which took more than an hour- but we were happy to wait, thinking of the money we saved from not buying the express pass! This ride was VERY FAST! It travelled at high speeds but was over quite quickly. My favourite of the many worlds is for sure Far Far Away, it seems the best thought out and is very magical- plus it has the BEST soundtrack when walking around/ waiting for amusements. MUST DO'S- THE TRANSFORMERS RIDE. I loved it the first time and loved it even more this time! I would have even rode it straight away afterwards but the line was a little long and I wanted to explore the rest of the park with my friends who had never been before- JURASSIC PARK RIDE. This is a great water raft ride and definitely a drawcard! Explore Jurassic Park on an innocent boat ride... but watch out, recent weather conditions means something has gone wrong with the dinosaurs....WATER WORLD SHOW. This show is a face paced, full of effects and stunts outdoor show with fire, water, loud music and boat tricks. Not to be missed! I've heard a rumour they're thinking of retiring this show so definitely go while you have the chance!MELS DINNER. There are plenty of themed eateries throughout the park which offer similar food, but I definitely find my favourite to be Mel's Dinner. A 50's themed diner with classic cars out the front and a stage for The Dinettes and The Cruisers to sing Acapella Pop Songs- such a blast and a free performance! SUNSCREEN. A lot of the attractions are water based or involve water, so make sure you re-apply your sunscreen throughout the day. FIREWORKS. The fireworks show at nightime was absolutely lovely, so if you can- stay the whole day and watch the Fireworks at night over the lake Because we bought our tickets with Mastercard we got 10% off and also got some ridiculous and oversized Shrek waterbottles in Far Far Away! It was great :)Although I've been twice I've still never managed to get photos with the Shrek characters! The slip of paper you get as you enter which tells you when the characters are around for meet and greets seemed to have failed me this visit, because Shrek and Fiona weren't at Shreks Swamp when the piece of paper said so. Not a big deal... I guess I'll just have to come back ;) Not much had changed since my last visit, Far Far Away had expanded for some new Puss in Boots themed attractions which were fun, Seasame Street took over the Hollywood strip and The Minion Mart was a new addition. However I definitely think I loved it more after this visit, and I still haven't done ALL the rides!

review_364274518,“A must go place if you are in sinagppore...”,"A few tips if you are going to universal studios ...- take a cab and get yourself dropped if you are staying nearby and on your way back the monorail will take you back to vivo city free of charge. - if you are looking at a place to eat street food at a cheap price , there is a food court opposite harbor-front on the other side of the road. there is one exit from the harbor front which connects you directly to the that food court.- food inside Universal studios is a bit expensive. there is one food court each for each of those attraction segments. ex: if you are ancient Egypt the food you get are related to same.. - transformers is a ride you should not miss / we loved he mummy ride as well...

They really need to update some things like the Terminator one seriously we lined up for what we though wasa ride only to have a performance ... Yea no.

Some good rides for younger kids are "" the Madagascar: a crate adventure"" & ""treasure hunters "" . One of the rides I went on which was quite scary was the "" TRANSFORMERS The ride: The ultimate 3D battle"" I wish there had of been more of a discription about what to expect as it wasn't suitable for children. But over all I had a really good time. But also in the shops everything was very expensive. But it was still a great experience.

review_364049893,“A good amusement park day”,"Universal Studios Singapore is small by most amusement park standards. This was my 5th visit since it opened. Like most things done by the Genting organization, it was well built but is not being well maintained. At opening, I thought this version of Jurassic Park was the best of all the Universal parks. Now sadly the highlight animatronics are broken. The T-Rex that is supposed to be the big scare just hangs droopy headed and not moving while the roaring soundtrack plays on. This is the Genting way. Build it nice...never touch it again. It is pervasive through the entire Resorts World Complex.Back to the park itself...as it is the only real amusement park in Singapore, it is a good day out. There is an assortment of attractions for all ages. START LEFT! The mildest attractions are to the left and build as you work your way around the park. If you start to the right, the big thrills will be over with early and the rest of the day a continual let down on excitement as you work your way to less and less exciting attractions. Like most parks, food and gifts are overpriced...no surprises there. Food quality is a bit lacking here as compared to other Universal parks. This one does have the best version of the Mummy. I would not recommend staying on the island. It is too removed from everything. Stay in Singapore and come out to the island for your Universal Day. There really is not much other reason to be at Sentosa Island. I have posted other reviews of my hotel stay in the resort as well as the other attractions visited.

review_364029695,“Good day out”,"Good family day out. Queues weren't too bad with the longest wait about nearly 90 mins however others were ok. By staying later, the park started to empty by about 5pm and the long queues were only a few minutes waiting. Worth arriving a bit later and staying to closing time. Some high speed rides require all items to be put into a locker. The first 45 mins is free but you have to pay after that and with some waiting times quite long - watch out. Probably worth paying for fast track tickets. Food prices were ok when comparing with other theme parks. We got a giant hotdog (18 inch) & fries for about $18 which was large enough for two people. By paying with Mastercard at the information booth located behind the ticket booths we received 10% discount and a voucher for free Shrek drink bottles.

review_363922022,“Mr Hassan ”,"Went there for the day. Reasonably priced entry if you purchase tickets online. Lot's of areas closed off to public, which they don't mention to customers on website. Really expensive snacks at food outlets, even for UK citizens. Example, 5 Singapore dollars for a 300ml plastic cup of blue slush ice. Usually 50p from my local ice cream van at a UK Park. Park map gives the impression of an enormous piece of land, the whole Park is spread over. I did a full lap with my family in 15mins. Many things are charged for in addition to park entry fees. They deliberately make you hire lockers to store your pocket contents, watches and baggage etc, in the hope that you overshoot your free 85 minutes rental period and then 4 Singapore dollars an hour kicks in, accrued in one hour increments. This isn't very had to achieve when you experience that average queue is just under 2houes long.

review_363545728,“Good but inefficient loading and unloading that eats into your fun”,"We went as a family with our child (10). This park is not the same as what is in California/Florida. This park is very much smaller and can be covered in half a day if you plan your rides and have the appropriate tickets/passes. We got tickets to Universal as a part of 2 day fun pass to Sentosa. We reached Sentosa at 9:45AM and the park opens at 10:00AM. We did get our UNLIMITED rides passes in the front gate guest services. If you are planning to be there for only half a day, I highly recommend this unlimited rides pass. This pass/hand tag, will allow you to skip the long lines and jump in front of the line in addition to riding any number of times. This pass is similar to Disney's fastpass except with no time slot. Please keep in mind that unlimited pass is not valid on 4 rides. I remember one of them was treasure hunt where you sit in a jeep and go for a short ride around a pre-defined path (boring! boring!). The other one is just a rock climbing activity which we skipped anyways. The other ride Canopy Flyer in the Lost World section/area. The lines for those were anyways shorter. The last one is magic potion spin which is a wheel for kids so we skipped that as well. Rides are great and my kid had lots of fun riding the coasters and other ones. They do suspend outdoor rides in the event of thunderstorms etc. However, it seemed temporary and they are opened when it is safe to do so.I had to rate this as an average only due to the fact that the staffs are not trained to load and unload. Loading an unloading is nowhere close to Disney for sure. When you see a ride with wait time 30 mins, it is the same as seeing a ride in Disney with wait time 10mins. Definetly staffs are not trained in loading and unloading which takes lot of time which eats into your day. If the park is crowded I highly recommend the unlimited pass ($50/person). You may end up going in each of the rides atleast 2 times considering the inefficient loading and unloading.Food inside is expensive but you are left with no option. There were many places that had water fountains to fill up the water bottles.

My favourite ride was the transformer which is and indoor ride that has multiple sound and light distractions to keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Food is a little expensive but no more than you expect to pay at a major tourist attraction in a large city. If you are looking for a fun day out there are plenty of different rides that cater for all age groups the 4D Shrek ride was a bit of fun and one I am sure all the younger kids would really enjoy. We would definitely head over to Sentosa again if we return to Singapore, the most fun you can have outdoors in Singapore.

review_362982865,“Great park with lots to offer for rides but food is nothing special”,"We were a little concerned that the park was going to be tiny and not have a whole lot to offer an adult couple but we were really impressed with what they have. It cost about $75 Singapore dollars to go which is about the same Canadian which seemed pretty reasonable. Some rides had major waits up to an hour or two and we were there during low season. The one thing that really annoyed me was the Jurassic rapid adventure ride they don't provide lockers like they do many of the other rides even tho they advertise that your stuff will certainly get wet. So whatever we decided to get a locker we rented for an hour because the wait time was 35 minutes. While waiting the time kept going up and up then after waiting probably close to an hour we decided to do the single rider line. Once we got back to our locker we see that we went over the time and we owed money. It just seemed like and absolute money grab to me. Other than that the rides were all good but the food is all fried and nothing great.

review_362667315,“Nice and loud”,"The reason why I think Universal Studios in SG are average and not more are basically: a. the place is not very big, b. the place is sometimes too loud. Ok I can see the objection: cannot go to some amusement park and pretend the peace of the Austrian Alps. True, but the matter is the music all over the park (commercial music, not something dedicated to Universal movies or themes) is set up quite loud and there is nowhere to find a quite oasis, for example when your small kid finally sleeps down, exhausted. Pair it with the heat, which in SG is a constant, and you'll find why I found it unpleasurable. When they have some show on the road the music of the show mixes with the loudspeakers of other areas... This said, we did not try all the attractions, kid being too small sometimes, but we found some of them quite good, Transformers above all of them. The place can be visited in half a day to one day, depends of how intensive you go around, and I found it to be comparatively less attractive then, for example, Disneyland which we visited in Anaheim and Orlando. Food offering around the park is ok, whereas it is mostly junk food or fried things. I found the website to buy the tickets not very functional and particularly the mechanism to purchase the express passes (or how they name them) felt to me more on a rubbery base than on a fair base. ""Rubbery"" might sound a too strong word but that is how I felt it. The fact is on their website the price for Express Pass is indicated to be SGD 30,00. Actually this is not true as it is increased on a base of demand/offer (or supposed so) criterium. So when I logged on the website the price for Express Pass was indicated as SGD 50,00. I looked around to understand why this difference but could not find any explanation. Finally, not wanting to loose too much time I effected the reservation and when I wanted to pay for some reason the card payment did not go through. When I finally logged in again the price was raised to SGD 70,00!!!. So, all in over we had to pay for the Express pass SGD 80,00 more (160 if you consider the price they put on the website) and I felt about being treated very unfairly, if I do not want to use the term robbed anymore. There was also an Easter Egg Chase event which was not explained in detail (it was about SEEING some eater egg around the park) so I ended up to buy 4 tickets for it when only one would have been necessary (another 30 SGD shelled out for mostly nothing). Paid just for the kid, if it was for me I would have avoided to go, this is why it is so bad: they rely on the emotional blackmail most of us bring a kid there and you do not want to explain you do not want to go because a few bucks. Still, greedy. Total damage for our party of four, 596 SGD, in my opinion totally not worth (if not for the kid). Okay, you can avoid the Express pass (which costed basically the same amount of money of the entry ticket) but I was in holiday, and not wishing to stand hours in queue in the heat with a 4 years kid for any attraction (still waited enough for some of them). Beware: Express pass was LIMITED to one entry per attraction, unlimited would have cost more. Still, inexplicably, some attraction do NOT have any express pass lane so so that you simply pay and wait. My feeling how this park is managed: with little respect for customers, but great for own bank account. Would return? Nope.

It was one of the most amazing experiences that I've had with an amusement park. It was so funny because we went for ""Revenge of the Mummy"" and we thought that it was a horror house or a horror train like the ones here in Philippines. While entering, all of my friends were shouting thinking that machine operated mummies were there to scare us, only to find out that it was a high speed roller coaster! It was the best experience ever because I am usually afraid to ride any roller coaster ride here. It was my first time and definitely not the last time.Another must-try is the ""Transformers"" ride, we really felt that we were part of the movie. All of the other rides and amusement are gonna bring back the child in you! I am excited for another visit here this coming July!

review_362252159,“A day in Universal Studio Singapore”,"That day was initially intended to explore the famous Universal Studios. Because of my epic fail attempt going to Universal Studio during my last trip, this time it really excite me. At a very expensive ticket price at 79SGD with ride all you can and 1free meal, we need to get early at USS and blame our long list of things we want to achieve with this single trip for a limited time to explore the entire Universal Studios. It has lot of thrilling rides. We prioritized the famous rides recommended by friend who had been there – all of us clueless of what’s inside each ride but one thing I know is the Galactica. But unfortunately as we entered the USS, that ride was under maintenance and will open by July (so sad!) and I think the sky know that were sad and it rained that day! Awesome! Among the rides we tried, I personally think the Transformers and The Mummy were the most awesome! Apart from trying the rides, we took the time to just walk around and swung our way around Far Far Away castle and meet my prince, Shrek. Too bad there were very few characters in costume roaming that time. Jurrasic Park that makes my clothes and hair get wet. We got the chance to watch a live sea war, a death-defying stunt show at the Water World. I really did enjoyed the few rides we had and appreciated the creativity and effort to recreate the movie set from each of the ride entrance to the ride itself. After of all the rides, we get our free food from our voucher in one of the fast food at the Far Far Away Castle.

review_362144800,“Great experience for first time”,"First time at any USS. We went on a Friday and we felt there was a lot of people. We arrived later than we planned around 11.30am so the lines were fairly long already. The average wait was around 20 minutes because we made use of the single riders line. I highly recommend this. Most of the time my husband and I could sit close to each other and it was definitely worth not having to wait in some cases for up to 200 minutes! Free lockers are available for limited time outside certain rides so make the most If them.For lunch we went out to the hawker food centre which had cheaper food than inside USS. You can leave and go back inside on the same day. All up we spent about 6 hours there and this included going on all of the adult rides except the Human battleship galactica one.

review_361927256,“Awesome family fun activities”,"I came here for a holiday with my family once back in December (near Christmas) and it was so magical! The area is huge so even with an entire day pass, you won't have enough time to go through everything (especially if you want to go to the aquarium next door as well). The rides were really fun and the lines weren't that long either. There were lots of shops for souvenirs so if you feel like resting for a while, you can just browse inside the cool, air-conditioned stores. There were also a lot of mascots that you can take pictures with. So if you're on a budget and you can't go all the way to Hong Kong Disneyland for a holiday, try heading over to USS with you family for a fun-filled day!

review_361665166,“Great”,"USS is a wonderful day activity to Ve included in your Singapore itinerary.The park is divided into various sections and themes.The must visit rides are revenge of the mummy, human vs robot, transformers 3d, jurrasic park adventure. Rest of the rides are meant mainly for kids.The shows lights, camera, action-steven Spielberg, Shrek are a must visit. (Waterworld was under maintenance when we visited)The need to make time for character meet and greet as lines close up really fast.Its advisable to get a bottle of your own as it gets very hot and humid throughout the day. There are lot of fountains to refill your water from. Singapore water is extremely safe.If you need to cover most of the rides opt for single rider wherever possible as we get to fill an empty spot on a ride and complete the same within 5 minutes instead of standing in queue for 40 minutes.You can cover the entire park in a day.

review_361642986,“Go on a weekday to avoid queues”,"It's worth going to a universal studio once in your life but if you have been to the one in the USA or to the Gold Coast in Australia it's pretty much the same. Getting there you can pay to go in cable car, or you can use you regular mrt ticket to catch the train or you can actually walk across a shaded bridge about 10 minutes to get there for free. For those who have never been to a theme park, wear comfortable shoes because you will be waiting in line a minimum of 30 mins to 1 and a half hours for each ride so in a day you can probably get through 5 to 8 rides. If you have small children think about bringing things to entertain them whilst waiting in hot queues. Don't miss the transformer ride, I think it's the best ride I've been on. For each ride you exit via a store which makes it difficult for parents with small children. See if you can promise them a toy at the end of the day and they can choose from all the shops they go through. Avoid buying somethings first up because they will pester you again at the next store. In terms of food it's all disgusting American fat fried food. If you are used to eating healthy, bring you own food because apart from the odd apple there is nothing you will be able to eat that is not stuffed with fat or sugar.  If you have money you can upgrade to a fast pass for $50 extra per person. I personally find this system disgusting because it basically means if you have money you can avoid waiting in line with the masses and if you don't, bad luck! Apart from that the decors are amazing, the rides pretty good and you can have memorable family day.

Layout is great with food, refreshments and toilets dotted around so you are never to far from those. Ticket pricing too is reasonable in my view considering the quality of entertainment. Kids can be kept entertained throughout the day with rides and shows. In my opinion way better that Disneyland Hong Kong where everything felt sub-par relatively speaking. Thoroughly recommended, buy the fast track as well to save some time (though even with that waiting could be quite long at times).

review_361447181,“Awesome is the word!”,"Since I have been to Disney land, I can not help comparing it but it was as expected, no doubt. There is a huge crowd on weekends and holidays and it is better if you start early so that you can finish as many rides as you can. Given it is not as big as Disney land, it can be covered in a single day if planned smartly with some very good rides. We took anti-clock wise way to start our rides. Some of the rides are kids specific and might be boring if you dont have one. My favorite rides in order are Transformer's, Blue Galactica (Cyclone - it is more difficult than red one as you go upside down and the air time is more, but you get the full view of universal studios from inside \m/), Mummy ride - with surprise elements in it. Rest of the rides are worth an experience as well.They dont allow outside food so make sure you had heavy breakfast if you are either a vegetarian or willing to save some money, as you dont have good veg options.Note**Check the timings before going because on some days it is open until only 6 instead of 8 pm. You can come here via monorail (4SG $ each). If you are more than 3 members I would suggest you better take taxi/uber because monorail is free for return trip and thus you can come here easily via cab paying the same or less amount and go back free! One more suggestion would be to not take return monorail from Imbiah, instead if you want to save some time and have some energy left, walk until waterfront station - which is hardly some 500-600 meters from here and take monorail from here, since it is less crowded as compared to Imbiah - which is Universal Studio's stop!Enjoy your trip!

I have a nine year old daughter and a 2 year old son who both were able to enjoy the rides and the facilities of the place. Some rides however that my son wanted to ride where in Jurrassic park and beauce of his height he was not allowed to go. My daughter however was able to ride most and had the time of her life. What I liked about the place was what every spot had a store to buy what you might need and there was an ample amount of food stores and bathrooms, we never had a problem with waiting in line. There were also a few new rides from when we last visited, which means the park is always bringing something new to the crowd to enjoy. The Water world area was closed however and we weren't able to watch the show which was a staple to every Universal Studios Visit. Universal Studios Singapore is really a good place to visit whether with family and friends where everyone is sure to enjoy.

review_361098695,"“Worth Every Ride, especially for first timer”","I came here with my fiancee, so we surely looking for something thrilling. Universal Studio offers it in a very well theme park setting. We can finish all te thrilling rides without the express pass. We even have some of them twice. Even if it was in Saturday and the park is pretty much crowded, the waiting line is not as long as what is noted in the entrance. For example, when a ride information board told us to expect 50 minutes waiting, we already finish the ride before 50 minutes.Most of the thrilling ride wouldn't allow you to bring bag inside the ride. Even when actually they have something like locker right next to the ride. So if you are in a thight budget, you better not bring bag of any kind.However, they have locker for rent. Do not take the locker in Jurassic Park section. It cost you $4.00 every hour. You can take the locker in Revenge of The Mummy section or in the Human vs Cylone section which offers free locker rent for 45 minutes and 115 minutes respectively.3 rides I mention above is the thrilling ride. The Jurassic Park is like a rafting track where you probably get soaking wet (luckilly I wasn't that wet). The Human vs Cylone is the Roller Coaster ride. Very fantastic, especially the Cylone one (blue track). The Mummy Revenge is indoor Roller Coaster which is also amazing. Don't forget to take the Transformer Rides which is mostly like virtual Roller Coaster with dramatic 3D experience. It was a real fun.Food here were expensive compared to those in the main island. The park closes at 8 pm. Most of the ride ends in 8 pm. However, the park is started to be less crowded by 5 pm at that day.Overall it was a very impressive experience especially for first timer.

The kids loved the Madagascar rides but there weren't many rides for younger kids (only around 3 or 4). The Treasure Hunter car ride was uneventful and tacky and you expect more after a 40 minute wait. The food was expensive. The express ticketing system where people can pay to push in front of everyone patiently waiting is unfair (try explaining why people just keep pushing in front of you to your kids after they have been waiting patiently 40 minutes, kind of teaches kids it doesn't pay to be patient and that money can buy everything).

review_360570059,“nice place to escape from routine”,"Be prepared in gate before gates are open. Make sure you already choose the rides especially for popular rides, like Transformer, The Mummy revenge, and Battlestar Galactica.I suggest to watch the water world rides, Based on the blockbuster film, ""Waterworld"", witness a tidal wave of death-defying stunts, along with thrills and spills from real explosions of fire and water at this sensational live water show.

review_360511546,“Soo fun”,"We visited US around end of February and had such a great time! It is quite a long walk in to US if you choose to go via the Sentosa boardwalk so the train may be a good option if you wish to avoid this. Obviously we went in the low season so it wasn't that crowded and thankfully no rides were closed. Do check this on the website before you go because they tend to schedule maintenance in low seasons. However, despite the low season the queues were sooo long. There was at least an hour wait for each of the main rides which was a bummer. As suggested we HAD to purchase an express pass which is available in most shops inside the park. The express pass is an absolute necessity if you want to go on the rides. however, after 4-5 pm the crowds do lessen and we got to get on those same rides without a pass in like 5mins.The rides are worth it, i especially loved the Cyclone! The light show at night isn't all that and lasts for like 5 mins but try to get a good spot. Oh and the food/ drinks inside are ridiculously expensive- $6 for a bottle of water! so do bring your own drink and snacks. Overall we had a really fun day and would definitely recommend a visit

You'll never know if you're going to turn or go down a slope so please hold tight! 2. TRANSFORMERS The Ride. It's a 3D battle ride you'll totally enjoy. Its fun to be a part of you favorite movie!3.

review_360267964,“10 Things to Note While Visiting Universal Studio”,"Dear all,Visited Universal Last week from India. It was awesome but due to lack of knowledge of my agent bit screwed. 1. Universal has 3 types of tickets: Normal Ticket (around 77 $), Express ticket (99 $) and Express unlimited(110$).2. Please note here visitors comes from across the world. I have seen groups from Russia, India, China, US.3. Since it was long Holi holiday in India could see lots of Indians. Because of this for each attraction I have stand min 1.5 hrs in line, this eats up ur whole day and you end up not seeing many of the attractions. 4. If you visit via agents that too via SIC (recommend never go by Singapore SIC) then you have limited timings like 5.30 pm.5. To avoid all such messup: Ensure you take express tickets (ask your agent to have that ticket only) . There we dont have any option to UPGRADE::X6. Ensure if you have baby then take pram with you (I ended up paying up 15$). You will min one whole day to visit universal completely. Also if you want to shop ensure you have min 200-300$ for shopping as no item is less than 50-60$.7. Try to get Universal map before you go there. You will save time in looking,planning, knowing attractions and route.8. Agents generally give out timing as 6'clock, however closing timing is around 8-9 pm. Agents gives this timing because night charge of SIC is high.9. Please note : Private car are cheaper than these SIC and unlike india you need not book it via mobile. There is a dedicated Taxi point at universal you get taxi very very easliy even at 11 pm.10. Taxi meter starts from 3.2$ (some starts from 3.9$), you can get both option as taxi comes very frequently. People stand in line and when their turn comes they see taxi standing in front of them (you can say helping guy over there that you want 3.2 $ taxi ( :) if want to save some money). I had bad bad experience with Apollo Travels SIC service: being very- very rude and their drivers keep on saying if you dont to wait, get out and take private taxi (they say so cos they already have ur money in their hand).Hope this review helps!!! Enjoy you trip to Singapore...

review_360220047,“2year olds first holiday”,"Great place to take kids. But if you have young kids and want to avoid lines, make sure you go on off peak times (not weekends or school holidays). We went on a Wednesday, just as it opened and the longest we had to line up for the first hour was 5min (and that's with a standard ticket). The park it self wasn't as big as I thought it would be, we did 2 loops of the park, but was a good size dragging a 2 year old boy around. Food was reasonably priced for a theme park. I was expecting it to be super pricey. We brought this large container of ice tea for $15 (I think) it was like a litre bottle and you could then get cheap refills. Good amount of rides for little ones and my husband and I took it in turns to go on the ""big kid"" rides. Public transport to the island is pretty easy. We took the mono rail the first day which was $8 per person then the second day to Sentosa we went along the board walk. The board walk has moving walkways nearly the whole way so you really don't need to walk that much

review_360202201,"“Make sure to visit the transformers ride, the rest of the rides were average ”","Before you enter into Universal there were no queues and we arrived around 11am. I read reviews on here on where to book the tickets cheaper and it was recommended to book via klook.com as you get the tickets 15% discount. Booked online with them no problem and same day received my e voucher tickets. The transformers ride is awesome even though we queued 50mins for it was worth the wait. The mummy ride to me was a basic roller coaster ride and nothing wow. For me it was just an average universal studios especially when you compare it to the one in the states. It is worth a visit as it's fun for the kids. The park closed at 8pm but we were pretty much done by 6.30 and went for a bite to eat after. Plenty of restaurants as soon as you enter out- Hard Rock Cafe, chijis, McDonald's, and plenty more. Make sure you cover up as it gets extremely hot. The good thing about the queues are the fans around to keep you cool. Inside queues have aircon

review_359978458,“A fun-filled day out!”,"When I asked my girlfriend what she most wanted to do in Singapore she answered ""I would like to take a photo in front of Universal World"", so popular has this place become that of all the shopping centres, restaurants and other attractions Singapore has to offer that the most important thing for tourists to do when visiting the ""little red dot"" is to take a photo in-front of the revolving Universal Studios logo globe out the front of its Sentosa Island theme park.After queuing to purchase a ticket and paying a reasonable entry fee, you need to queue to enter the grounds, then once inside you burst into a whole other world - you could be forgiven for mistakenly believing you are walking along Hollywood Boulevard itself, except this one is an all-weather one, completely under-cover!Once you have caught your breath and made your way to the first ride (in our case it was the Madagascar ride), you are soon breathless again because of the size of the... wait for it... Queue! 40mins!! Anyway, once we lined-up and eventually got aboard the ride, all was well - it's quite an experience, especially for children or those young-a-heart :)Then to the south is Shrek's Far Far Away Castle, which is just like the movie having been brought to life. Queue for Puss in Boots' Giant Journey or Shrek 4D Rides if you like - only 25-30mins each, haha! Onwards to Waterworld, which unfortunately during my visit was closed, so we moved West to Jurassic Park's Lost World where the biggest, most Jurassic queue I have ever come across exists (70mins), so we bypassed that one and went to ancient Egypt instead where everything is very beautifully crafted and with the heat it makes you feel you really are in Egypt with all the statues of Pharaohs & Hieroglyphic replicas - amazing!We then went to Steven Spielberg's Lights, Camera, Action! ride, which has the shortest queue of all at only 15mins, but was certainly very informative and interactive explaining how the stunts are often filmed for an action thriller. Thence there is the New York City-themed area, which, like Hollywood Boulevard, is I imagine about as close I will ever get to New York City without actually being there. Onwards to the technology park where Transformers-themed stuff is everywhere, which would be mesmerising for those inclined.Once you have done with the rides there is ample shopping and food shops strategically placed all over the park for your pickings. The products they sell are all genuine and of great quality, but as is to be expected in Singapore, expensive. With the exception of the queues, Universal Studios in Singapore is a wonderful day out - next time I return I will be purchasing the ""Express Pass"" for a relatively small additional cost, which I didn't know existed before entering the park.

review_359971936,“It can be crowded during weekends. Read on.”,"USS Singapore is slightly smaller than those outside the region. Having said that it's ideal for a 1 day visit. If you wish to cover all the rides(esp the popular ones)come early at 10am when the park opens.Like many suggested, go right straight to the popular rides. Skip the entrance and zip thru the crowd to the Galactica rides. Its the most thrilling ride you can ever find down there. Try both the Human and Cyclon both equally heart-pounding adrenalin rushing rides. Then move to the Transformer 3D. They are awesome thus the queue here can get very long too.These are at Sci-Fi City.Then move on to Revenge of The Mummy ride at Ancient Egypt. Don't be fooled by the peaceful mood at the entrance cos this ride is by far to me are 2nd best next to the Galactica rides. Treasure hunters rides aren't that interesting but often the queue may get long maybe because kids like it. Look out for the Characters at Madagascar and you can take photos and dance with them.Afterwhich you can continue with the other rides. Those rides i mentioned above can easily take an hour ++ to queue when the crowd starts to build up.For those with small children. The Shrek 4-D show is fun with all the effects can be felt on the seats while you enjoy the show. After the show there's a mini ferris wheels enough for 4 children to sit it just around the corner.Especially for toddlers, ride the Sesame Street Spaghetti, its so much fun.Weekends are always busier so go during weekdays unless it's a school holiday season you have no other way but to blend in and wait. Alternatively you can buy the express pass to skip the queue but it'll cost more.For special dietary meals esp halal, certified restaurants there are Mel's Drive at Hollywood and Oasis Spice cafe at the Ancient Egyptian.The Hollywood parade will begin at 3pm and fireworks will start at 9.30pm.Note: There are a lot of people especially during the weekends after the fireworks.

It will take all of your day and you still wont get to see all of its rides and attractions ... There are some rides in particular which i really enjoyed and would recommend to any and all adults who go there ...To be honest there were some kids 15-18 also going for the rides so it just depends on who likes thrilling, adrenaline raising rides ...Battlestar Galactica (Cyclon and Human) : These 2 roller coasters are the highlight of the park, usually have a large waiting period and long queues to it ... Transformer 3D: This ride is quite nice as well, you actually feel as if you are in the action sequence while you are seeing it in 3DThere are lots of variety for food with stalls in each section selling food matching the theme of that section of the park ... Same goes for the people who like buying memorabilia from the attractions they goto ...  I waited 70 mins and 120 mins respectively for the battlestar rides ... Better idea would be to buy a priority pass which reduces your waiting period to approximately 5-10 mins ... The only way you can finish all the rides in one day ... There is a fireworks show over the weekends around 8.30pm, which i have heard is quite nice to see ...

review_359330401,“Good fun for the day”,"This was our second visit to Universal Studios Singapore. USS is fun, clean and has some thrilling rides (although not enough to make it worth 5 stars). It's a small theme park which makes it perfect to see in 1 day and easy to manoeuvre around.Some general tips:-buy tickets through klook for a 15% discount and avoid queues at the gates-arrive at the park before 10. When the gates open go straight for the Transformers ride, Battlestar Galactica Rollercoaster and maybe Jurassic Park Rapids. Following this method you will NOT need an express pass (on weekdays at least). We got to do all rides multiple times, the queues disappear around 6.-the park is seriously hot especially in the afternoon. Bring lots of water and plan to visit the shows during this time-eat just outside the park at the Malaysian food hall to save moneyThe rides:-Mummy ride, transformers and Cylon are the best/most thrilling. Often the Mummy ride has only a 5 minute queue-Jurassic Park Rapids queue is insanely long. Either ride it between 10-11 o'clock or after 6 to avoid a 1 hour + waiting time. Take your bags on with you to avoid locker fees (bring some waterproof pouches for phones/cameras)-New Puss in Boots ride not worth the long queues. Anticlimactic. Also the Madagascar rides can be easily skipped unless travelling with small children-Enchanted Airways Rollercoaster is unexpectedly good and worth doing

You might want to purchase the express pass if you have no patience in waiting in line. We went on a weekday and there was still line everywhere.

Initially didn't buy express pass as cost was extra $70 per person! Very steep cost but after reading the pricing is 'dynamic' I assumed it would be very busy. First hour was ok, but from 11 onwards wait times were up to 100 mins for most popular rides. Express was walk right in. Adds a big cost at $280 extra for family of four but worth it. Still think Legoland Malaysia is much better value for money and more to do for young kids. Wouldn't come back to USS until kids are early teens at least as most rides are suited to older kids.

review_358628751,“If you can afford it seriously consider the express addition to your ticket ”,"We had a great day, we arrived at opening (first big hint) and were able to do most of the big queue rides quickly. An hour after opening this disappears quickly. The queue for the raft ride was 60 minutes long by the time we got there, first express pass use, we boarded in two minutes. The food outlets get very crowded at the back of the park around 12 midday, try and plan to be elsewhere. The big roller coasters get 90 minute queues as the day progresses, shortened to 10 minutes with express pass (2nd hint).The rides are intense versus big, we enjoyed the day a lot, I liked the seat fitting station at most rides, need to add one on the canopy flight ride.

review_358575769,“Go early and on a weekday”,"We went with a 6 year old so some of the rides weren't suitable. It was a long hot day spent queuing and we went on a week day. Some rides were a 45 minute wait which is hard for a small child. We worked out where to buy the express pass later in the day so it wasn't worth buying as it does add a big cost to your day. Would definitely make the day moe enjoyable but if the budget doesn't stretch that far be prepared to wait for rides.

review_358502778,“Perfect ”,"We purchased the tickets for USS as well as for the cable cars prior visiting which saved waiting times at the queue.We selected the cable car to go to the USS. It was a fantastic view from the above.We visited there on Monday and it was not that crowded. First of all we visited to the Transformers the VR ride which we had to stay on queue for around 1 hour( in a less crowded day ). But it was worth the day, as it was really exiting. Next we selected the cyclone the best and adventurous roller coster in USS. If you are afraid of the speedy roller coasters you can select the human version of it. For this ride also we had to wait around 45 mins in the queue. Both of these attractions were at Sci-fi city.Then we went to the Ancient Egypt and went in revenge of the mummy ride. It was again one of the best. In Jurassic park , far far away land and puss in boots also you have some other roller coaster versions.We enjoyed the shrek 4D show as well. Tips, Carry a water bottle. You can refill it any place.Wear some lite clothes.Bring your own food if possible.

review_358426363,“Excellent day out for adults too! ”,"We are two adults in our 30s and had an excellent day at Universal Studios. Tips:1) Try and arrive when the park opens (10am) before the queues get long. 2) DEFINITELY buy an Express pass. This is worth its weight in gold. We bought the option that gives you one express access, but there is also a (more expensive) option to have unlimited express access. This saved us hours and hours. Eg. Battlestar Galactica (blue roller coaster) - 10 minutes in queue, versus 50 minutes for regular pass. The other Battlestar roller coaster (red) was our worst queue (45 minutes) versus 2 hours 20 minutes for the regular pass. With all other rides, we were on the ride in less than 10 minutes. The most popular rides are the two Battlestar roller coasters and the Transformers ride, so do these early. 3) Lockers - we hired a small locker all-day for SG$15. Again, very useful and highly recommend. For the roller coasters, you can't have any thing in your pockets as you go upside down. Unless you have someone to hold things for you, a locker is essential. They are located at various points around the park. 4) Water - being Singapore, it is very hot and humid. There are quite a few drink fountains around the park where you can fill up your water bottle which is very useful. Really fun day!

review_358339162,“Finally the kids are big enough to enjoy most of it”,"At 7 and 5, the kids are finally old enough to enjoy the majority of the rides. At 102 cm, all but 3 rides were accessible. The Shrek 4D adventure was great fun, as were most rides. Transformers was amazing! But also too old for my kids who were terrified (both girls too). Rides end up with long waits quickly 100 mins+), so either pay for the express passes, or be happy to get on your favourite rides at the start of the day and then picking whatever has a shorter wait in the afternoon. Ditch the park food and head out to Din Tai Fung or the Hard Rock for lunch. And avoid the pantomime performances at the Pantages Theatre. The shows are terrible, some of the worst rubbish I have seen in a long time (plot, acting, sound, the whole shooting match). Avoid the weekend or public holidays for a more pleasant experience.

We got lucky as couple of our friends joined us in this plan. It was a day well spent and we enjoyed alot. To my surprise my son had fun too starting from watching a movie show, Madagascar and dinosaur rides and so on. Just an advise if you don't want to wait for longer duration standing in queue go for a priority pass. Do not carry lot of stuff with you but in case you need to, don't worry you can keep your belongings in the locker available near rides where you cannot take them along especially roller coster. To all the couples who don't want to leave their kids behind, you don't have to. Just go and have a blast..

We had a fabulous full on day. The park is extremely clean & very well mainted, there are rides & attractions for all ages & and thrill seeking levels!! We were pleasantly surprised with the price & selection of food & drinks available through out the day. My biggest tip would be to purchase a fast pass which helps you skip long queue's & walk to the front of the lines. We worked this out after waiting 1hour 40mins for the Jurassic Park ride. Longest wait of the day. We had a fantastic day and were completely exhausted by the end of it. I thoroughly recommend Universal Studios Singapore as a fabulous attraction & value for money day out.

My experience with wife and kid was also awesome, for most of the shows. However, almost every show the queue is too long – in some cases we had to wait even more than 1 hour standing. A better queue or crowd management is expected from this world class facility. Another very important thing is most of the shows include bumpy rides kind of things, which may not be preferred by many of the visitors. There should be a good balance of different types of rides – some bumpy, some extreme, some normal, some smooth to offer each visitor as per his/her preference. Overall, it was really an excellent experience, specially for my 10 years daughter. Worth spending the money and time for. I may not go again but everyone should pay at least one visit into this amazing world of entertainment.

review_356760764,“Fun and exciting experience for everyone !!!”,"I had doubts on USS after hearing not so good feedback from friends but I had to entertain my two boys (age 9 & 15) because it was March school holidays! Turned out, I had so much fun myself! I love roller coaster that I took Revenge of The Mummy ride 3 times and Transformers ride twice! I was laughing and screaming with happiness during the Revenge of The Mummy rides because it's roller coaster in the darkness!!Initially I only bought the regular tickets but changed my mind after looking at the 5 rows of long queues at 945 am. So I bought the Express tickets ($50) for 3 of us. It is expensive but I thought queuing for rides will be tiring for the boys and will kill the fun. Our second ride was Transformers and there isn't many people queuing. The good thing is the staff will not encourage you to use your Express ticket if there isn't long queues. The Express ticket is one ride per attraction but you can join the normal queue line if you want to ride again. Because we went there early, we could take some of the rides at least twice. Food and drinks are expensive, of course! There are many water coolers around USS. In my opinion, go early and there is no need to buy Unlimited rides ticket. Unless you have kids who are crazy to go for rides many times. But my boys would love the Unlimited rides of course. Do spend that extra dollars for the Express Tickets because you will save a lot of time to enjoy USS and no need to endure with people who cut queues! If anyone tried to cut your queue, do tell them to go the back. I saw a few people who were shocked to see someone cut their queues and just stood there wondering. Now my boys is asking me for a visit to Universal Studios Orlando!! I am secretly excited myself because I know the roller coaster rides there is crazy!!!

We were in Singapore in the beginning of January which I believe is a busy time in Singapore and that reflected in the time we had to queue to get on rides (most were about a 45-60 minute wait). It was very hotyand humid so not very pleasnt waiting all that time in line with two 9 year olds. It came to a stage where we couldn't be bothered queuing for rides and decided to leave (it would have been worth buying an unlimited express pass each but that was about another $50 each).On the plus side, it is very easy to get to by MRT to Harbourside and then the Sentosa Express across to Waterfront station.

review_356487993,“A Thrilling Adventure!”,"One place where you can forget about everything and just go crazy! Have been there twice in consecutive years and trust me I can go there again and again. The team that works there is simply amazing! The performers are best at what they do and some acts will surely leave you in awe. My suggestion, reach there in the morning and stay through the day because the performances are timed and there are different interesting things to keep you busy, other than the rides. Don't forget to try all the roller coasters, specially Battlestar Galactica. No matter whatever age-group you belong to, there is something for everyone. You would surely fall in love with the place.

review_356454943,“Excellent place ”,"We went here on the first Monday of school holidays. If you can avoid it I would suggest not going on one of these days. It was very busy and long lines. We ended up waiting for the jurrasic park ride for 1.50Hours. When we lined up the sign said 50 minutes (long but we wanted to) by the time the hour mark came around we were far to committed (and stuck in the line) to leave the ride was excellent but would have been better to be honest about wait times and we would have come back. This was the same for the transformers.The park is very clean, the food was ok and reasonably priced. There is plenty to do. We got there shortly before 10 and got in quickly and did a few of the easy rides. The wait times blow out so good to pick the few you really want to go on and get them done early. Plenty of shows and things to do and see so I would suggest taking some time to plan the day to get everything in. We did our shopping last thing before we left toMinimise carrying things around and didn't have any problems getting what we wanted. This is a great day very long and hot, water sunscreen and hats are a must.Worth doing

""Once more Once more "" :-):-) ""Bigger queue bigger queue"" :-(:-( . I decided to buy Express Unlimited. Imagine the queue on other rides. It is expensive but totally worth it.Got around each and every ride .....many times. Had lot of fun. My advice if u can stretch your pocket....go for it.. u wont regret it and if u r a tourist, what r d chances of coming back. + Reach before opening time. U would like to spend whole day here.+ Outside food is not allowed, but they didn't checked bags. So.. + Many restaurants. Mel's drive in , A Chicken burger and coke costs 12 SG i think. Tasty.+ Water bottle is must to carry. Water fountain are available widely.+ Locker are available at cost. Free locker duration of 89 min for Mummy and Battlestar.+ Wear flip flop, not shoes ...Very convenient, carry extra t-shirt if u can.+U can identify the camera (Big Flash) during the rides n give pose next time.

review_355481265,“Still a highlight in an adult's life”,"I've visited Universal Studios Hollywood in the late 1990's. And after 17 years, I set foot on its ASEAN counterpart in Singapore. I may have enjoyed the rides more as a kid, but I appreciated the art, the spectacle, the complexity of movie making more, as an adult, with this later experience.The rides with the Mummy and Transformers were still a thrill, but it was that Steven Spielberg spectacle of being in the set that really set this experience high for me. Aside from getting cooked with the heating and fire effects, and getting wet with the rain and spashes fo the indoor river, being there on-set, made me think, why the hell did I not go into the industry of movie-making??Downside is the price. Everything in Singapore is expensive I'd say, and Universal Studios is no exception.

As great as the park is without them you can be waiting up til an hour for the more popular rides the only disappointment with the passes is although they say they are unlimited there is small print that says there are a few rides that aren't included which is disappointing considering you are paying extra for it to be unlimited. saying that i wouldn't do Universal without them.There is water fountains all over the park. The food is diverse you can get anything from burger and fries to chicken and rice or curry. We had an amazing time make sure you wear sunscreen it gets really hot.

review_354745927,“USS Easter Eggstravaganza”,"USS is currently holding their Easter event. This year, you need to get a separate ticket to take part in the egg hunt, watch the show at the Pantages and go for the Meet & Greet. The ticket is $15 at the door or $10 online.Pro tip: Starbucks at the Forum has free WIFI, and Guest Services can process your e-voucher :)The egg hunt was actually quite fun...some of the eggs are very well hidden. The prize is a large Minion-themed egg filled with various banana flavoured candy and Minion stickers.The show ""An unEGGspected Wedding"" at the Pantages was a bit of a let-down, mainly by the poor audio. It was a bit hard to follow the plot due to the muffled dialogue, supposedly it is a sequel to last year's story. Try to be at the theatre earlier as there is a small pre-show segment. After the show, you can go to the Meet and Greet at ""Eggingham Gardens"" to take photos with the Easter Bunny (?), Humpty Dumpty (he's an egg...Easter is eggy) and some of the cast from the show.We also opted for the Easter lunch buffet at Casa Del Wild (halal, limited choices for vegetarians). At $38, you get the Easter activities above as well as a decent lunch buffet. There is also a small egg painting activity, they even provided aprons for you to stay clean. The characters from Madagascar come around for photo taking during lunch. It wasn't crowded when we went, so we had a nice, unhurried lunch. The buffet included salads, Western food (potato gratin, chicken roulade), Asian dishes (fried rice, laksa) and a small dessert selection (carrot cake, bread pudding). There was pizza, fried chicken and hash browns for the kids. It was definitely better than what I expected. Drinks (refillable) are $3/person.There is some Easter deco around the park, mainly along New York. The Sunlight Eggspress (roller skate crew) does a short, awkward performance and hands out bead necklaces. Two short projection shows take place after 7pm at the New York Library.Overall, this event might appeal more to pass holders because it may be a little difficult to complete the whole park together with the Easter eggtivities. Or if you have children who are too young to take most of the rides, they can be kept entertained with this package.Other park tips:- hit the park in an anticlockwise manner, we noticed it was less crowded this way- don't try to skip queues or try your luck with single rider q when you want to sit with your group- many water coolers onsite to stay hydrated- check rws website for latest ticket offers- to Express pass or not to Express pass? The crowds can be a tad unpredictable, so if you don't mind q-ing or missing a few rides, then you don't have to buy one.

review_354698865,“Awesomest place in Singapore >>>>>”,"if you like rollercoasters, movies, food, fun, adventure, etc.. this place is for you!A days entry costs around 74SGD, I would recommend buying 98SGD season ticket which gives 6 month entry :) as covering the whole place and all rides is impossible in a days time even with EXPRESS passes (which cost 55-60SGD) over an above your entry ticket.Useful tip for people who want to save time - Go as 'Single Riders' even when you are with friends, as the queue there is smaller and you get to enjoy rides quickly, but only seated with strangers and not your pals... Trust me its fine... as you save time and energy.Lockers are available at entry and near each ride. there is a free time outside of each ride to keep your stuff. and incase you are carrying many things, buying a locker outside near the entry is advisable.All rides are fun. Don't miss Egypt, Jurassic Park and Transformers rides... all of them are amazing. For Jurassic park ride, you will get splashed with water so be prepared... if you don't want to spend money on locker, outside this ride(as there is no free time) a simple hack is carrying a small plastic bag to keep your wallets and cell phones) ... you can get wet and dry off easily by soaking the sun in 20 mins :)Wear comfortable clothing.. half trunks and t-shirts are best for men and women feel free to wear whatever but long skirts, delicate dressing, and too many accessories is not advisable....Carry caps, sunscreen.. Eat well after each adventure (but before the coasters at Sci-Fi city, else you will puke!)Amazing place to be!....

If the lines are small you can do all the rides in 4 hours or so if you stop in every shop. It opens at 10, but not everywhere is open until 11, so you don't have to be there right away.

We were amazed when we saw huge universal ball. I took pictures there. There are so many spectacular playgames there. We watched transformer 4D show, played rolller coaster, we took ride in small river.. So many many amazing things to play.

review_353919832,“Must visit ! ”,"Weather your traveling alone , couple or with a family ... A visit to universal studios is a must ! Took my wife and she loved it ... The place has a good number of games and attractions for a varieties of ages , I'd highly recommend getting your tickets online and arriving early so you beat the rush and longs lines. Also I'd highly recommend getting the VIP pass , yes it might be a bit pricy but it's worth it when you don't have to wait 30-40 mins to get on each ride cz of the long lines specially on weekends ! As expected the food may be a bit pricey but expected also you can easily find halal places within the park though I recommend taking snacks to keep you going

review_353734730,“Go to Halloween Horror Nights in October!”,"I had a lot of fun at the park in the afternoon with my group of friends. It's very easily to access, just off the monorail. However, I must admit the real reason this attraction gets a 5 star rating from me is for the Halloween Horror Nights experience. It was really like stepping into a twisted horror movie at times. The downside is that the lines are really long and you may not get to do everything you want because you'll be spending maybe three hours standing in a line for one haunted house (It's kind of worth it if you love that sort of thing). During the afternoon most of lines were alright. The Battlestar Galactica line was very long but it's a pretty good ride (The Cylon ride is the best).

Visited on a weekday to try and avoid the crowds but there was still a significant wait for the bigger rollercoasters (Battlestar Galactica), however with some good timing still managed to get a few rides without standing in line forever.

review_353579401,“Weekdays are the best”,"Weekdays are when you can enjoy the park the most: shortest rides queue, most chances to take a picture with the characters. Rides like Transformer and the Mummy only takes 5 - 10 minutes to my surprise! Battlestar galactica ~20 to 30 minutes instead of 50-60mins. There are lots of free water dispensers in the park in the middle of the queue lines, so bring a water bottle and keep hydrated in singapore's hot weather. That's cheaper than purchasing bottled water ($3 cheapest). Indoor rides like Madagascar, Sesame Street, Shrek 4D and the Revenge of the mummy are nice air-con places to escape from the sun.Food cost around $10-$15 in the various themed cafeterias in the park, outside food is not allowed, but it doesn't stop you from exiting the park for lunch (You can re-enter). Malaysian food street outside USS offers a lot of food at $5-$7.Best rides in my opinion: the mummy, battlestar galactica, Jurassic park rapids

review_353550414,“Not like in LA but still super”,"I had a chance to be in the Universal Studios in LA so th first part of my review is a comparison. The main difference is this theme park has different regions like Sci-fi, Egypt, Jurrasic park, Far Far Away, Madagascar and New York street. Half of the rides are really childish. Light roller coasters or carousels. And the other half is the same as in LA except one, the Battlestar Galactica double roller coaster. The Jurrasic boat ride, the Mummy's Revenge and the Transformers ride are identical. In overall the place is smaller than in LA and less exciting for an adult. If you just want to try new rides and have been in LA, you can totally skip it and save a lot of time and money.But in general as an amusement park it is a lot of fun! It's good to see characters and places out of the movies and walk around in life like sets. If this is you first time in a Universal Studios Park you can spend your entire day here trying out everything (sadly, most of time is spent in queues). Come early, even half hour before opening! Then you have a chance to try the most exciting rides fast. I recommend going in this order: Transformers, Battlestar Galactica Human then Cyclon, The Mummy and then Jurrasy Park boat ride. Luckily these rides are coming in this order in the park, you don’t have to go back and forth just forward. Don't miss the Universal if you haven't been in one before!

review_353131276,“Nice but not spectacular”,"If you are going there with or without kids, start at 10am when it opens so you can cover as many of the rides and attractions in there. Due to the lengthy queues for each ride, you end up spending just as many hours in queues as enjoying any of the rides & attractions. If your budget allows, I would strongly suggest paying extra so you don't have to waste time queuing. Hold on to kids as it would be very easy to lose them in the crowds.

review_352999398,“Best Theme Park in Singapore but...”,"Considering the amount of theme parks in Singapore being barely a handful, Universal Studios has made itself to the top. Been here about 10 times since it's opening years ago. Many fond memories forged here. Generally a very small park. You would be able to completely go through the park in half a day if not for the ridiculously horrendous waiting time. Or you can pay another 50% to your already expensive ticket to get an express pass. Maybe they can implement selective express time slot for free to regulate the crowd much like DisneyWorld? Then again there's nothing worse than the wait for special events like the Halloween Horror. While the attractions are good, the time taken to enter a 90 seconds attraction just leaves a bad taste in the mouth.Overall, it's a fun place to be in but be prepared to wait wait and wait.

review_352681158,"“Absolutely fab day, recommend it!”","We had a great day, lucky with the weather it has to be said, but for the unlimited cable car ride and entrance to universal it was just S$100 per person about £50 - considering you have to pay to go on the island anyway, this was a reduced price and good value considering how much uk parks cost now. You can get there cheaper, but the cable car is great and your pass to the attractions is about 10 dollars less that way. The rides were good, the battlestar galactica roller coasters especially. Not a huge park but good for a day out. We went on a Tuesday in Feb and didn't have to wait more than around 40 mins for the most popular rides, most were only about 10- 15 mins. There are other parks on the island but we didn't visit them. The whole place as you would expect from Singapore was amazingly clean, including the loos of course.

review_352495652,“Patience for the long queues is a must.”,"It was a trek to get here, and we went on Monday to beat the weekend queues- we took the Harbourfront MRT, went to Vivo city 3rd floor to take the Sentosa Express. $4 per adult for a return ride.There are three sections to sentosa and we got off at the first stop which links to the Resort world where Universal studios is located. Cost was approx $72 entry fee per adult.We waited approx 1 hour for each ride, and after 5 rides the queues and humidity got to us. Having being to US in USA and movie world in QLD australia i thought this was a bit of a let down. If you buy the express tickets you could get on the rides in about 10-20 minutes but an additional $50 per person. We did observe some staff did not check all riders for this type of ticket so was a bit let down that some where still pushing in and claiming their express line ticket.Some of the souvenirs were discoloured from the sun. eg the minions were pale yellow and looked old due to the wear and tear of the sun- mainly minion and sesame st characters sold.Overall an average day for two adults and eventually the lines and humidity told us to go home after 4 rides and almost 5 hours. If you are short on time get the express tickets. If we had a choice to go back, we wouldnt recommend it and the time it takes to get there + costs weren't that worth it.LInes back to Vivo city was extremely long. You need patience!

review_351763649,"“A fun day, a good theme park!”","Traveled in Feb 2016 as a coupleTimings: It opens at around 10.00 am and closes by around 7.00 pm. Tickets: Ticket price is around USD 74 per person but you generally get discount of 10% either through their own website (master card offer) or through other sites. We booked through their own website, got a 10% discount and free shrek mugs worth SGD 20. Generally it is advisable to book in advance as there are long queue for ticket purchase also. Also note that for advance booking be sure of the date as the tickets are generally non-refundable and non-amendable unless for extraordinary cases. Express pass costs around USD 50 per person more. Take a print out of the online ticket as that will suffice for entry.Getting There: Take the MRT to the harbor front station and either take the Sentosa Express from the 3rd floor of Vivo City Mall or take the cable car.The Sentosa Express is the cheaper option (SGD 4 for the return trip), you need to get down at the waterfront station and follow the signs to Universal Studio. Cable car costs around 25 SGD (but also includes ride on cable cars in the Sentosa Island) You might also take the cab.Rides: We enjoyed All the rides. Battlestar Galactica and the Mummy were the highlights of the day. Transformers was also good but after the 1 hour wait we lost the charm for Transformers. We did both the Human and Cyclon rides in Battlestar and found the cyclon ride to be more thrilling and exciting. Cyclon is the one which is suspended and involves a lot of twisting and turning including 360 degree spins. The queue is also shorter in cyclon as compared to human. We also enjoyed the water show, the donkey show and the Shrek 4D Movie. The water show and the donkey shows are at specific timings so kindly note the same before going. You will get wet in the water ride in the Jurrasic Park section (you may buy a polythene cover at SGD 4 at the entrance of the ride or carry your own). Puss in the boots also looked good but after doing cyclon you may give it a miss if the waiting time is long.Lockers: Bags are generally not allowed for rides like battlestar galactica, mummy and the water ride in jurassic park section. Free lockers are available outside Battle star galactica (first ~50 min. free) and the mummy ride (first ~ 40 min. free). Other lockers are chargeable.Tip - bring hat, sunglasses as it get really hot. Food in the park is expensive, you may choose to carry your own food. I would advise to do the famous rides in the afternoon when the water show starts (around 1 PM). Most of the people are seated in the stadium for the water show and the waiting time for rides during this time for us was 15-20 min. You may catch the water show later at ~4.30 Pm. We went there on a Sunday instead of a Friday or a Saturday as advised to us by our friends in Singapore. Sundays are relatively less crowded.

review_351736499,“was great but...”,"when we talk about singapore, one of the first things that comes up in someone's head is Universal Studios...and so we went! it was great! the place was nice and if you're a fan of the movies, you will certainly be able to relate to everything, getting you so excited to see everything. but then, it was too crowded that we were only really able to ride two things (madagascar crate adventure and the roller coaster). everything was full, it took forever! we really just had to patiently wait for our turn on the roller coaster (to make our trip at the place worth it). but, hey, the roller coaster was worth the wait! it was crazy fun! and i love that they had drinks sold everywhere in the place (the weather was too hot to bear). and the lockers (for those who want to ride the roller coaster) they provide proved to be safe. we had to leave everything we had (our camera, engagement ring, passports, wallets) and not a thing was lost. one more star for that!

review_351442500,“Smaller than US ones but adequate”,"Don't expect it to be like the USA. Rides are a lot milder.. We visited in February and it was not very busy which was great. We got there at 9.30, opens at 10am and was not busy so we got on a few main rides really quickly, then we used our express pass. I would say It's worth paying the extra $30 (especially when busy) as it's hot waiting in queues. Although they have drink fountains and fans going. But at this time of year (after Chinese New Year) only a few of the top rides had waiting times of 25-30 mins, most we were on in 5-10 mins.

Only to our utter dissappointment, apart from the ride to do with a tomb or something (some sort of indoor roller coaster), teens/young adults really dont have much to enjoy, the two HUGE roller coasters were shut. And those are the main reason why we even went, I would definitely not recommend anyone to go there, if you have kids, it may be fun, but anyone upwards of 11 is gonna be bored.

review_350972466,“A great place but better if the show was on”,"Universal Studios is located on Sentosa Island which can be reach by taxi or cable car. Discounted tickets are available through the rwsentosa.com website for Mastercard holders and include a Shrek drinking cup until May 2016. We went a couple of days ago but were disappointed that the Waterworld show is not on every day. This was not shown on their website. Other parades and singing performances were cancelled due to rain so check out the forecast before you go. It opens 10.00am - 7.00pm. Riding the Transformer experience was amazing as were some of the other rides. Smaller than Universal in LA, it is still worth the visit at $68 after discount. Other things to do on Sentosa include Aquarium, lovely restaurants and a water park. It's a full day out.The view from the cable car is wonderful. Catch it from Mount Faber ($29 return) for the longest ride and if you catch it back early evening, you can enjoy the pretty lights of Singapore..

review_350924289,“Unlimited Express pass is worth it if you have young kids or want to enjoy all rides”,"It was crazy during CNY .... initially we bought only entry tickets, went inside, there wasn't much crowd but the queues were huge!After waiting in a normal queue for about 45 mins...we decided to get the Express pass - we got the Unlimited Express pass for SGD 90 each, had loads of fun....not all rides are for the young ones (min height 120) so it turned out good as the kids could enjoy unlimited rides without any wait times - the longest we had wait in the Express queue was 5 mins only - so it TOTALLY worth it!!!!We enjoyed ALL the rides except 1 or 2 that were suddenly shut for maintenance...another thing is that for all the really good rides (Ancient Egypt, Jurrasic Park, Sci Fi etc) they said there is a wait time of 40 mins for Express and advise to go for other rides, so we went on another one and again they said the same. but this time we said ok and went inside and found it wasn't the case, we got in less that 5 mins - not sure why they said so....We spent the whole day there, food is plenty inside, veggie options too...Suggestion: Take the map and go in reverse order, starting at Scifi or Jurrasic, all the good rides are on the right and this is were all the ""locals"" or people visiting again go, as first timers we didn't don't know ....we could have missed withour the Express pass!!!

Shrek 4D can be quite confronting for young children or those with sensory issues as very loud and due to being 4D your seat moves and you do get sprayed in the face a few times.Best rides included Jurassic world Rapids, Shrek and Madagascar as well as Transformers!Great day out had by all and our son talks about it most days so it definitely had a lasting impression

review_350272656,“Bring back the Kid in you ;)”,"I visited Universal Studio last June 2015 just before my birthday. My visit to Singapore was very short and decided to pay a visit in the Universal Studio and Sentosa. Who said going there alone is not as fun as going with friends? I enjoyed my time wandering around Universal Studio. Its as if a small Global Village where you can visit the famous places in the world like Egypt and New York. The Staff were very courteous and knowledgeable of all the directions and rides. The place is very organize and very entertaining too. Rides are very safe though some rides were a little scary but you can trust the materials they used in the Park were up to safety standards.There was a food court close to the Jurassic Park which is big enough for the customers however there were limited variety of foods. The serving was a little small but is fine, food service was fast and the food court areas were clean.They keep the park clean and entertaining for all ages, I have to admit that the Water World show was the best show they have and would recommend to watch... its worth a wait for the show pal! In order to enjoy the whole park one must spent a day, some rides have a really long line to wait and when you get there you'll realize that you've waited an hour for a 15 minutes ride. When you go to Sentosa just before riding the Train please do not buy the 2 pass tickets (Sentosa and Universal Studio) why? it is because you will not be able to utilize it all since Universal Studio will cost you a day.Another tip going to Sentosa, you can walk from the mall to Universal Studio rather than taking a train that will cost you more... Honestly the walk is worth trying to see the beauty of Sentosa, at night while walking you will also see a robotic bird show in the water. In case you finish late in Universal Studio which is mostly the case, it is better to take a walk from there to the mall and ride your train home rather than being in a big line to ride the train back to the mall. If you plan to watch the most exciting show they have (water World) I recommend to bring an extra shirt and be ready to get wet! also don't forget to be jolly and friendly. Going there alone was fun and memorable, you get to meet a lot of strangers that will become your new friends. It takes back all your childhood memory about fairy tales, castles, princesses and Cartoon friends you used to know. It makes you feel young again and get away from the stress outside the walls of Universal Studio.

It's our fault we were expecting too much of this place. First of all the Strong points of this place:Perfect for families with young children!Lots of shows and mild adventure rides to cater all ages. Great 3D adventure rides with special effects (the best for us was Transformers).Located in Sentosa, so you can do more things in one day apart of the universal studio experience. Good public transport connections.The weakest points of this place:Not as big as it looks like.. You could spend around 4 hours to do most of the rides and walking around.If you are expecting rides like some found in Alton Towers in UK(with no fatal accidents as with the Smiler of course) like 13, Air or Oblivion..Or the ones in Port Aventura in Tarragona (Dragon Khan, El diablo..) There's two fast rides but I found them milder to those mentioned!So this is our opinion, it's not for thrill seeking people. We might be back when we have kids though.. Who knows!

As a big Universal fan I couldn't wait to get in and it offered something slightly different even if it was on a smaller scale. Even though its hard to not compare it to its bigger counterparts it does still offer a great day out and that is reflected in the price. In the Singapore Tourist Centres you can usually find a map that has lots of coupons attached and this is usually one of them to get around $5 off. Food choices are limited but that is to be expected in a theme park, but the rides are fantastic as are a couple of the shows and the waits aren't too ridiculous.

The 12 hours I spent there went by in a jiffy.You can never get over the amazing rides of Transformers/Mummy and the Roller Coaster (small but scary).The place has a lot of souvenir shops but they are expensive.

review_348769070,“Plan your day well to make the maximum out of the visit”,"This place has 7 zones, lined one after the other.The variety of rides are both for children and adults, fun rides and adventurous rides.It would be very helpful to do some research beforehand and make a list of rides one wants to take in order of priority.Figuring out on the spot can be a hassle because by mid day the waiting time can be as long as 2 hours.I would recommend spending the entire day there, We could do all the rides of our preference and some additional rides too.Plenty eating points are available within the premises but one can take their own food too.Some rides we loved - Revenge of the mummy ( Ancient Egypt), TRANSFORMERS The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle ( Sci-Fi City) , Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (The Lost World)Some shows we loved - Lights, Camera, Action!™ Hosted by Steven Spielberg (Hollywood), Waterworld (The Lost World) - only 2 shows in a dayGetting there - take a free walk on Boardwalk ( the path has moving walkway so one does not have to walk much) or cable car for a view or sentosa express for $4.Sentosa express can be taken from Level 3 of Vivocity mall. People coming from MRT need to get down at Harbourfront MRT station which opens into Vivicity mall.Boardwalk can be taken from Level 1 of Vivocity mall.Sentosa express transportaion is free on the sentosa island and also for the return journey from Sentosa island to Vivocity mall.

review_348752524,“Crazy fun!”,"It is one of the best experiences one can have. Simply amazing! Have to go early in order to cover all the spots. It is a draining experience so energy level needs to be high. Don't wait more than an hour at any one spot. It is a waste of time. If there is a long waiting time try to go on ahead and find a spot where the waiting time is less and come back later to those you have missed. Special mention for Battlestar Galactica and Mummy. However Transformers is the peach!!!!

The rides to definitely experience more than once, Transformers, Revenge of the Mummy, Battlestar Galactica, Canopy flyer. Watch out for the Jurassic Park rapids ride, a lot of water gets splashed onto you and your shoes defintely get wet.

review_348079010,“A really good experience”,"My boyfriend and I bought the season pass for Universal Studios Singapore. We went to Universal Studios Singapore quite a number of times due to the unlimited number of entries for the season pass and we felt that it's a really good value for money. I would strongly recommend locals to buy the season pass as it can really save you alot of money and you also get more perks like discounts and all that.We absolutely loved and enjoyed our time there in USS even though the main roller coaster (Battlestar Galactica) was under maintenance during the period of our season pass. We're thrill seekers, it would be much more enjoyable for us if there were more rollercoasters in USS. So because we did not get to ride on Battlestar Galactica, I would say the best ride for us is the Revenge of the Mummy and the Transformers ride. The rest of the rides were more for kids, but it was still okay for us, young adults.The queues at some of the rides are rather long, don't bother queueing for them, instead go for another ride with a shorter queue and come back later, most of the time the long queues will shorten by then. I would recommend people to spend about half a day in USS, it's more than enough time to cover all the good rides. (:

review_348071369,“Wonderful place to take your kids”,"It is very easy to get to universal studios. No need to book a tour if you can take public transport or a taxi.This is one of the best places to take your kids. But one should definitely buy the VIP pass which allows to save your time on queues and if kids want to experience the amusements multiple times, you wont regret it. We went on a wednesday, it was pretty crowded for a mid week with no particular occasion. After my 6 year old wanted to play transformers more than once, we regretted not taking VIP pass. You can spend a whole day here, if you have kids, get there early as they may get tired by lunch. We missed the water world ride as the line would take a week for our turn to come! Do try transformers game, Madagascar was nice for kids, Egyptian theme rides and dinosaur ride were more for adults.

review_348053969,“Loved it!”,"Been there 4 times ever since it opened. Each time was an experience. It is a must visit place in Singapore if you have not been to an universal theme park. Be prepared to queue if you visit during holidays. Tips:1. Buy your tickets online, if not you will be spending hours queuing for tickets.2. Be there early esp if you are going there during school holidays or weekends.3. Don't bring too many things to carry, for some rides you will not be allowed to carry things with you. You can use the locker provided at the entrance to store things but it will cost you money. ( I can't remeber how much) I believe there are lockers near some of the attractions but again it would cost you money. A pouch or a sling bag should be sufficient for you to carry around. 4. Buy the express ticket if you intend to experience all rides in one day.5. Food - vegetarian options are limited and not worth the money. Might want to pack a sandwich to go.

review_347501491,“Fun day out!”,"Visiting Universal was a must for my Singapore itinerary. I haven't been to any Universal parks before this one and i was not disappointed. The park is located on Sentosa island, so not on the main island, but is easy enough to get to - via either cable car (less waiting time) or the Sentosa express rail (very busy stations and cramped carts). The park has attractions to suit everyone including little kid safe and scary big person rollercoasters. We went mid week and that helped with less people queuing for rides but expect about 20mins wait time per ride. Around the time of the water shows, there is less wait time, however the Underwater Show is worth seeing. Universal is fun for everyone and don't worry about missing a souvenirs at one of the gift shops; there is some towards the exit that sell all the same gifts!!

review_347475914,“Heat & one grumpy staff..”,"To be fair, this is minor but it only takes one staff member to spoil one's good experience. ""Linda"" was operating the kids dinasour merry go round (the push button to lift the vehicle) on Tue 2 Feb2016. At about midday she became very agitated, yelled at a number of customers that we were in the wrong queue (even though it wasn't signposted And she assumed we understood mandarin!). She was clearly grumpy and affected by the heat, and wanted no more of the work. The replacement staff arrived to find that fat Linda had taken away the key for operating the machine! Another staff member had to run over to help. Bad staff like this need to identified and removed. I told a group of staff members and they all agreed that she was appalling in how she interacted with the other staff and customers!An obvious reminder to all foreign visitors, the heat and humidity in Singapore means that you have to be prepared to wear these typical climatic conditions when roaming this relatively small theme park. Research also on neighboring country school holidays. We completely overlooked the China school holiday to our detriment. These are my two tips that may not be so obvious elsewhere. Have fun!

review_347270697,“Maintenance and upkeep needed”,"1st visit was 4 yrs ago, park was still rather new and everything in tip top condition.Visited usj last year for harrypotter attraction, usj was maintained very well, although it was much bigger, perhaps due to their less humid weather. Overall universal studio seems a fairly great place to go.Thus our decision to purchase the annual express pass for uss, however things took a spiral down turn from there. Upon entering, the usual upbeat friendly smiles from uss staff was missing, in place we found bored and slacking expressions on most of the staff faces, not even due to busy overcrowding, the park wasnt even that packed on a Friday, and average waiting time for most rides less than 30mins, so why are the staffs all so unmotivate in low spirits, apart from a few diligent staff from mummy and Jurassic park rides.Toilet maintenance could be much improved, floors are wet and smell terrible, especially the first one I went in next to entrance. Glattic rides can't be missed, it's an awesome ride, but the seats smells awful, it was so bad that the less than a minute ride caused me to vomit, not from thrill of ride, but because the safety harness straps were too smelly! Someone could at least give these seats a wipe a day for God's sake.Worse part was when we had to use the lockers at glattic rides and found a used tissue in our assigned locker?!Went Starbucks for a rest but couldn't because most of the tables are taken up by huge families without a single order on their table...Quite a speechless experienced considering the amount of money spent for membership and express pass.

Typically though we were on the very next 'loading' with barely a couple of minutes wait.

review_347079018,"“My escapist one-day holiday, three times a year”","I'm a frequent guest at Universal Studios Singapore (USS), and this was a monthly experience for me. I've been on every ride several times, and being a resident in Singapore I must say this is probably the best theme park experience we've ever had on the island. The best rides in my opinion (in order of personal preference) are: The Battlestar Galactica, Transformers, The Mummy, Jurassic Park's Rapids Ride, Puss in Boots, Jurassic Park Canopy Flyer, Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase, and Accelerator. The rest of the rides are pretty standard theme park fare, which kids may enjoy depending on the level of their endearment to the licensed characters. Note for travelers who've been to Universal Studios Orlando: The Transformers ride is an exact facsimile of the Universal Studios ride in Orlando, so you aren't missing anything if you've ridden that one before. Lights! Camera! Action! is a smaller version but worth a look. For the shows, Waterworld and Puss in Boots are top notch, and the Donkey Live Show and Shrek 4D can be a hit or miss, depending on the crowd that day. Food is decent for USS, and I think they put in more effort seeing the typical Asian's love for good food. Pizza at Loui's used to be above average, but has since declined in standard. The local fare at The Lost World's Discovery Food Court is decent but with turkey legs at nearly every corner and superb fried chicken at Goldilock's are far more deserving of your calorie quotas. Overall, I'd say this is a great treat for travelers to Singapore. Look out for Halloween Nights and the weekend parades too if the timing is right. Weather: be prepared for Singapore's hot, humid weather, with the not-uncommon showers. Temperatures can hit 35C in the open, so bring water (there are water coolers around the park) and dive into the air conditioned rooms where you can. Many of the queues are in open air (except for The Mummy and Transformers), so you might want to strategise queuing for the hot periods for these rides. If the food is not your fancy, there's a plenty of local fare just outside of the park, but you'll need a re-entry chop if you want to come back. Ideally, a full day will be required to comprehensively cover the park with some rests over meals, but if you don't want to rush it (especially if you have young children) do it over two days. Adventure Cove also makes for a great second day stop.

Transformers has single rider line, take it if you are ok to ride seperately, saves a lot of waiting. 40 minutes wait for most of the after an hour, after that it was over 90 minutes for some, but we had done them already.

The food were good but expensive. The bathrooms were clean and were found everywhere. The mascots/characters should stay longer for picture taking.

Long queue is expected often about 30-45mins per ride. If you want to try every ride, 1-2 full days is expected. To cut queue time you may purchase express tickets.

review_346427492,“A great day”,"A great place to spend a day... Be prepared to pay though as the standard tickets will mean a lot of queuing ... An extra SGD 50 per person gets express pass (one use per ride per day), SGD 70 gets unlimited express pass usage - this is over and above the normal entrance price... Our 11 yo and her fiends had a great day, could use all rides and thoroughly enjoyed themselves. The food outlets aren't great but have to be used as own food is confiscated at security

review_346422524,“Fun for the Kids!”,"We had a great couple of days at Universal Studios. My kids love going on the rides so most of our day was spent lining up. The lines we not that long, except for the most popular rides, which were about an hours wait. On our second day we purchased a front of line pass for $50 so the kids could go on their favorite rides without waiting too long. The only thing we found strange, was the Jurassic park section didn't open until 1 hour after the park opened. It was roped off and then by the time it was ready to be opened there were hundreds of people squashed together fighting their way in so they could get to the Jurassic Ride (I think the most popular at the park). It was really uncomfortable and we got trampled. Other than that it was a good day out.

Brought out the child in me. Next time I go to Singapore may stay on the island so can use all the amenities. Some of the rides scary but mostly they are easy rides so young children will have fun too. Although they have the time of waiting outside each ride it is mostly a quicker wait on most of them.

A little disappointing that the rain cancelled some appearances for some of the kids shows. We spent all day there and could've used a few more hours to see more.TIP: We had a family of 4 and contemplated buying the express. We only bought 2 express tickets and it was worth it considering some of the lines thinned out by end of day. You can buy the express tickets inside the park if the lines get out of hand.

review_346187226,“The Best Singapore Attraction”,"When visiting Singapore it is one of the most essential attractions to visit. Very entertaining. Weekends and holidays are sure crowded better to schedule a trip on a weekday and off-peak season. It is better to book a 2-day ticket to get the most out of USS. Do not ever leave USS without going to the waterworld attraction. USS is not the best place for kids under 2 years old as they can't really appreciate much of this park; parents will just be stressed with them as the weather can be very warm and sunny.

review_346125438,“Awesome Entertainment Experience for all ages”,"If you're into fun and thrilling experience, try Universal Studios Singapore. Located in Sentosa Island, you can reach it via MRT (harbourfront station). Then take the Sentosa Express at Vivo City. Alight at waterfront station. You can buy the day pass ticket for $74 (adult) and $54 (child). Food and drinks are not allowed. But you can try bringing a bag with a sandwich and a bottle of water for snack because food is quite expensive inside. You can bring along a water bottle because there are water fountains inside the park, just refill 'em. Don't forget to bring a poncho (raincoat - you can buy at daiso japan store in vivo city. It will only cost you $2 at daiso and $4 in USS) as well because you might get wet in one of the attractions and it sometimes rains in the afternoon. You don't wanna get wet! You must bring an extra shirt in case of emergency too! Come early as there are lots of tourists and locals visiting the park especially on weekends! Outside USS are lots of restaurants, souvenir shops and cafes. Hope these infos can help!

The day we visited it was not particularly busy however the queues were horrendously slow.

review_346022786,“January Family Holiday 2016”,"Loved the whole concept of the park. So very different to the Sentosa we saw when we were last in Singapore in 1978. Children would love many aspects of the Universal Studios theme park but some of the rides would likely be too much for some and there are restrictions re height as well. The Universal Studios Sentosa website has a pdf you can download called the Riders Guide. Read it before purchasing any tickets as it will save you $ and also let you know in advance what your child/children will be able to go on and not. Whilst it is not the cheapest day out as far as prices for entry it is probably comparable to somewhere like Dreamworld all said and done.Whether you are buying tickets in advance or on the day and you absolutely hate long lengthy queues, then purchase the Express Pass as this will allow you to walk past those queues. Hubby and some others in our group waited 90 minutes to go on the Jurassic Park ride. Only after that did they realise they could go and buy the Express pass.My eldest daughter went on the zip line and loved it [I was supposed to go on it too, but prolapsed a disc in my back on Xmas Day so no rides for me :( ]Food is what I call standard fare for theme parks - it's okay but nothing to write home about.If we had more time we would have loved to go back and see the Trick Eye Museum and Underwater World and get around to see Siloso Beach area...maybe next time :)

Many of the restrictions can be found on the website and its really well worth the time to check it out... So heres what we know. The hotel booked our reservation at $74.. our kids were free 0 and 3... we arrived at Marina Bay Gardens and changed bus...Arriving at Universal we entered had a coffee etc at Starbucks and planned our Itinerary ... Baby age 5 months and boy aged 3.... queued 70 mins for first ride and found out you can but an express ticked $60.. PP.. You can use this once for each attraction, but given the mandatory hight restrictions 90% of the rides do not accept the express..!!!! had difficulty getting any hot water for our baby boy to make milk... The rides with the Express ticked had a waiting tome of 60+ mins causing problems with our 3 year old.... left early and TAXI requests were a nightmare...the attractions and street carnivals a disaster, as so crowded you could not see..Really adults great, but families with young kids BEWARE ITS NOT WORTH IT..

A majestic world one has always dreamt of and would never want to leave ! Undoubtedly assuming the heavy rush at this place , I would appreciate the arrangement of washrooms and drinking water are absolutely perfect and upto the mark . The washrooms are very neat and clean and I would rate them @ 5/5 for the maintenance ! But somehow I felt that the prices for water, food and other drinks were too high and not worth the quality and quantity as well !The beauty of universal is that it's a tourist friendly place and apt for all types of age groups ! The rides were great and daring as well ! Well, I would suggest the tourists to take a Universal Unlimited Express pass to cover the entire u overall studios without having standing and waiting in long queues ! We had a great time because we could manage to cover the entire area till 4pm and thereby we even repeated many rides and shows bcz of the unlimited express card ! Street shows are great fun to watch including the cartoon characters which keep on roaming about on the streets !

review_345520903,“A must visit in Singapore!! But pretty expensive during holiday season”,"Been at Universal Studios, Singapore during my Christmas vacation. Entry fee for an adult is SGD 70 and if anyone wants to pay for express pass (limited), pay additional SGD 70 and 90 for unlimited express pass. Unlimited express pass entitles the fun/thrill seekers to take the rides/shows multiple times. However, for few rides even express pass is not valid, everyone has to stand in a line which makes you feel being overcharged for the passes. Need one whole day to complete all the rides/shows at the studio. The best ones which I liked are:1) The Transformers2) The Galacia (the big rides)3) The Mummy4) Jurassic World5) The water show (specific show timings)During holiday season its recommended to visit the studio on a weekday rather than on weekend. The park charges might be lower on weekdays as compared to weekends.

The biggest surprise for me for the Transformers ride. I had heard that it was good but never expected it to be THIS good. I visited the place with my wife and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Singapore. The food inside is priced reasonably well but the same cannot be said about the merchandise. A few points to note before you visit the place to make sure you have an enjoyable experience.1. Dedicate an entire day for the visit and reach early (10 am) - Anything less and you will miss out on a LOT2. If you aren't travelling with kids then USE the singe rider line - It will save you a LOT of time3. Do not carry a lot of things to lug around - Most rides have a free locker which you can make use of but then that just adds to the time4. The best rides in the park in the order of preference. Do NOT leave the park unless you have experienced all of them  - Transformers- The Ride - Battlestar Galactica - Cylon - Battlestar Galactica - Human - The Mummy ride (forgot what it was actually called) - Jurassic park - Rapids - Shrek 4D

review_345177835,“Good for a starter if you haven't been to other larger formats”,"Singapore is smaller than many cities in the world! And Sentosa Island.... smaller than many privately owned Ranches and Farms! Taking that into consideration, what they done with Universal Studios is not just commendable, its phenomenal! They have Rollers Coasters for all age groups, and much more. The best is the Cylon, a definite 'do not miss' thrill.A few important tips:1) Always lookout for online promotions. You might come across some excellent bargains with excellent freebies.2) Buy an express pass only. It will save you almost an hour per ride in case of good ones and 15-25 minutes in the ordinary rides. Don't worry if you bought an ordinary pass. You can top up with an Express Pass after entering too and dedicated stores inside too. They have Unlimited Express pass too wherein you can visit any ride for more than once.3) It will be tiring, exhausting and thrilling. Carry only what you can't live without. Less things to take care of, more you will enjoy.4) Align your time with various events and activities going around the place. They have something or the other going on for various age groups. Decide what suits your style!

We arrived at Sentosa at about 9.40 and found cheap tickets for sale at the Harbourfront end of the boardwalk which was a lovely surprise (although this seemed like a temporary thing). We entered the park as it opened and went straight to the more popular rides like Transformers and The Mummy, before making our way to the Jurassic Park rides which don't open until 11. We then made our way through the Far Far Away Land, Madagascar and Hollywood sections which tended to have shorter lines. We spent the middle part of the day and early afternoon watching shows and street performers, before going back to the rides where the lines had started to shorten. Food was ridiculously overpriced, but what more can you expect from an amusement park? Overall it was a fun day out, although it would be nice if they had a few more rides.

There are plenty of places to eat and drink and most of the restaurants are halal certified. The Cylon and revenge of the mummy are highly recommended rides. Lockers are available before the more serious rides and are recommended. Do carry some cash though to unlock the locker if you are returning after the initial free period has expired. Be prepared to wait in long queues and like elsewhere in Singapore, dress for hot and humid conditions.

review_344660070,“Too crowded for enjoyment ”,"I've been to universal studios a couple of times. The rides and food were good. Rides had a relatively big range for both young and old and all well maintained. For the food there is also a range which is a tad overpriced compared to what u see in some other theme parks (Disney land in Tokyo for example). However, what really put me off from visiting again (at least not any time soon) was my one experience when we went over a public holiday. The queues had reach 5 hours for battle star Galaxy which is a ridiculous time to wait for a ride. Not to mention the fast pass queue (it costs double the price to get the pass - unlike Disney which is free) was also 2.5 hours long. The theme park could have easily avoided this by not selling anymore tickets. They were also not open about the wait times or when the rides would close. Apparently, the ride would resume once the fireworks ended and this meant u could wait inside even though on paper it says the rides all stop earlier than that. I'm just surprised for the amount they charge, they stop the rides so early. Theme parks like Disneyland in Tokyo which costs about the same stays open till 10pm and rides go on all the way till then. Maybe universal should consider the same especially if they want to let heaps of people enter the park and not exercise any control there. Ruined my what could have been good experience at universal.

When you sit down and the ride starts, it's fast compared to others who is slow at the beginning. There are many loops for sure and it has a STEAM that will surprise you which is a big deal for me. I've been riding roller coasters since I was in 2nd grade and this is one of the best.

By the time we stayed in the queues we weren't able to visit all the attractions. There are 2 amazing roller coasters but the issue is if you are going in the normal queue without the express pass there is a nearly 2 hour waiting time (Which we simply couldn't bother to wait). There are some excellent attractions and some not so amusing ones as well for instance we waited in the queue for the Puss in Boots ride which was so not worth the time.

review_343759091,“Not worth the queues”,"Firstly I'd like to recommend not buying your ticket online and going through a travel agent, it's much cheaper.I arrived at the park at 9:30 so we got in the park when it opened at 10am. At first the queues were okay as it wasn't as busy but the later it got the worse the queues got. We looked into buying a fast track ticket but they were asking for $80 each, which is well over what we paid for the ticket. When going on the the fast rides you have to put your bags in the lockers you get 45minutes free then after that it's $4 for 20minutes over. Complete rip off! Also don't trust the queue times quoted either, we got quoted 15 minutes and we are waiting over an hour. The rides are good but not good enough to queue all day and spend all your money on lockers.

Due to i'm alone ,i had requested your staff to help me to offload my 2 bag which was hung to the stroller and she agreed to help me to offload my bag. While i was squatting down infront of the stroller to unseat my baby(1 yr old) from my stroller, tragic things happen. Tthe stroller had fallback due to the heavy weight of the bag which resulted my baby was hurt by the stroller belt and your staff who had promised to help me was now where gone!It was a terrible mistake make by me which i trust in good faith of your staff that will render her help. Pardon me for raising my voice to your staff WAN, but as a parent, if things happen due to you had comply the theme park rules, how will you react when your child being hurt?I requested WAN to bring my baby girl to your in house first aid to seek for medical needs there where i receive humilating treament from your inhouse nurse by the name of Lemuall. Lemuall had informed there no problem with my baby leg no swollen and no crying, he had revert me to go hosiptal to check for xray. I told him if he diagnosed no problem, i requested him to write a note, but he rejected.i had ask Lemuall who going to take responsibility since he had informed there is no problem with my baby, he even challenge me i can write to your company legal team to seek compensation.To make things short, inside the medical centre there a few staff by the name of Maria (operation manager of Pantages Hollywood Theater,) WAN (staff from Pantages Hollywood Theater), Lemuall (in house nurse),Haja (customer service represetative),Maria had ask me what had happen and the condition of my baby, i ask Lemuall to relate to Maria.Below is the conversation between my and Lemuall Lemuall: Can your baby speak or stand? There nothing wrong with her leg since her leg is not swollen or cryingMe: Mind you, my baby only 12 months old, how she able to speak or stand?Lemuall: I have 8 kids, my kids is able to stand and speak at this age.Is this how your train your in house nurse to ask patients or baby when they need medical attention?When having conversation with Maria, it seem all your staff are sided to your workers. It's really a disgrace to knew all your staff who i mention merely push the responsibilty when accident happen and yet no help is render, this is extremly dissapointing and shame on you guys!Last note, if you are a parent who is taking care a toddler alone, how will you feel? Prior when this accident happen, i had when to your jarassic park restaurant. Stroller was not allowed , but i had requested your staff to help me to offload my bag ,it was a breeze for me to take my lunch alone. rdgsMatthew

We did not go on the big rollercoaster rides but the others were fun.The wait time for some rides were 45 minutes.We had purchased a express pass so wait time was only about 15 mins maximum. I would not have enjoyed the day if I had to wait 45 mins for some rides. The purchase price of the entry ticket is $70 then with the express pass an extra $70 it was an expensive day out for 2 of us.The price of merchandise in the park shops was laughable although the price for lunch was not bad.If you have kids then they will of course enjoy the place but I would not consider this a must do activity while in Singapore.

We pre-purchased VIP tickets to enjoy the full experience of the park without waiting in the endless queues for the rides & shows. Although expensive, we don't regret our decision. We had a wonderful guide, Cheryl, who couldn't do enough for us. On the day we went, we were the only two on her VIP list for the tour, so we were very fortunate to be able to choose between which rides we wanted to experience. We were always given front row seats without waiting in any lines. For people who have been to Universal Studios in California, don't expect to find the one in Singapore the same. It is not a working movie studio as the latter and therefore much much smaller in comparison. Nevertheless it is worth a visit.

The reason I give one star is everything was very slow here from the gate & very long queues all the lines to the ride anyway from 45 mins - 120mins. Lucky we bough the tickets from the hotel we don't have to line up at the gate. They just let too many people in at one time. The ratio of people in the park need to be smaller number for everyone to enjoy. It's seem ridiculous paid $175 for family ticket just to walk around the park...

For adults, Universal studio has rides like Transformers, Mummy, Jurassic Park rides, Cyclone (Blue) & Human (red) roller coaster rides. Out of these Cyclone was awesome and scary. To take these rides, you need to put your all stuff in lockers which are available there and these lockers are free of cost for few minutes then chargeable to 4 SGD or more. Other than rides there are many shows out which I like water show (near to Jurassic park). For kids, Far Far away, Madagascar, space ride and many other attractions are available. Ticket cost is 74 SGD (to enter and all rides are free) but google it and you'll find online price @ 54 SGD approx. Also you check universal express ticket to kill the long 'Q' Line (which is worth spending more money on this ticket) as this ticket will allow you to enter via VIP line.

There are two kinds of express pass. limited which gives you 1 express per ride on any given day ($S30) or unlimited ($S50). it is $50 well spent..2: If you get there early (9am-ish), you may be selected as ""The first Family"". This is a promo where you get taken in in advance of the crowds then get to open the park.

And yes try to not visit d Park during school holidays as it is chaotic during that time. There is food court in every theme park inside the studio, if you have d express pass you can visit most if not all d rides inside d studio with time in between to watch the shows.One whole day can easily be spent in d studio enjoying if you have the express pass, especially for family with children.

Being Christmas time the queues for rides were long but expected.The transformers ride is the star attraction for adventure seekers.They need to add rides to decongest.

review_342804062,“Good fun on Sentosa”,"Went here on a local holiday so it was very busy on the monorail and at the resort particularly as we didn't pre-book so we had quite a wait to get tickets. We also would have purchased express tickets which allowed people to go straight to the front of the queues. Some of the wait times were up to 120 minutes particularly on the more popular rides. The whole experience is good fun although not quite to the US scale in terms of rides and entertainment, however still good for this area and there is plenty to do nearby.We had a fair bit of rain, however there was a lot of shelter.Food we felt was more varied just outside the park and you could get your hand stamped to allow a return to enable this.Plenty of water is available FOC which helped during the queuing.We did experience a couple of occasions were people queued for 40+ mins only to be turned away as their children were under ride height, so watch out as you enter the ride.

review_342741284,"“Great safe,clean experience!”","Nothing needs to be written about universal studios, am sure. However, would like to add a few tips here. It was a fun experience, of course. Fortunately, we had taken the express pass and did not have to wait anywhere for more than 7 to 8 mins. This is another 50 SD, however, certainly worth it if you are going during peak season. Those who have issues with height can avoid the revenge of the mummy experience also, as it is pretty close to a roller coaster feeling. Carry enough water and if you have a kid, take a pram along. Use the pre-loaded MRT cards at Singapore, so that you can use the same for the sentosa ride as well....again you save on time

review_342725285,“Good amusement park”,"My friend living in Singapore give us a tour here. My favorite attractions are Transformers, Revenge of the Mummy and Water World.If you are going to Water World, get ready to be wet. Bring raincoat because they are spraying water and even throwing pail of water in the audience. If you dont want to get wet, go to the higher/upper box seats.It's best if you have extra clothes, even underwear and pants. There are free drinking fountains around the area, just bring water bottles or tumbler. The queuing line is much shorter during weekdays. I really enjoyed this place even though we are walking all day and falling in line up to an hour. 1 day pass is not enough if your really want to experience all the rides.

review_342499911,“One whole Day of Fun!”,"Before we went to USS, me and my wife made a little research through the internet on do's and don'ts for a maximum fun.First, avoid the weekends/Public holiday (if possible).. Although you'll miss the parades & fireworks (Saturday only). But still, we went there Saturday!Buy tickets online for time saving (maybe there's special discount). Wear shoes, since there are some attractions that can make you wet from head to toe, and also you can run to your next attraction. Park is open at 10am, so go early. Don't forget to take the map and the schedule at the park entrance (it is free).We ride our (we're 29 y/o couple) favorite attractions first. (there are 7 different Stations). Suggested Rides (in chronological order):0. Entrance: Universal Studio Globe1. The Lost World: Canopy Flyer (flying vehicle)2. The Lost World: Jurassic Park Rapid Adventures (river raft)3. The Lost World: Water World (live water/stunt show)4. Ancient Egypt: Revenge of the Mummy (extreme roller roaster)Lunch time at Discovery food court (The Lost World)4a. Sci-fi City: Battlestar Galactica both Human or Cylon Track (sad that these rides are closed when we visited, but they reopened last July 2015)5.New York: Lights Camera Action (movie set)6. Madagascar: A Crate Adventure (Kiddy boat ride)7. Far Far Away: Sherk 4D Adventure (cinema 4D)8. Far Far Away: Enchanted Airway (junior roller coaster)9. Hollywood: Parade of the cartoon characters!!! (bring your camera)After all the rides, we've returned to EACH ONE of the Station for photo/selfie opportunity.Dinner at Marty's Casa de Wild (Madagascar)...wait for some time...rest.End the night with Fireworks display near our dining table.Buy Souvenirs.Tip: If you want to skip regular queues, buy Universal Express or Universal Express Unlimited.

review_342491236,“To do things in Universal Studio Singapore for adults and kids”,"Visited Universal Studio on Jan 13,2016. We visited on weekday but still there were long line at every ride. Waited 2 hours for Transformer ride, but the wait was worth. It rained intermittently on that day so they kept on closing roller coaster ride. But we managed to do one roller coaster at least. As soon as you enter studio, there might be a feeling of ""now what to do?"". So let me try to put in simple terms. Just take right and head straight to transformer, as it is going to be long wait with time. Kids are allowed, but smaller kids like 2-3 year old may get frightened, so better go with older kids say 6-7 years.If you are with kids, just take left when you enter studio and head straight to Madagascar ride. In front of Madagascar there is a light ride for every age of kid. then a little ahead, there is ""far far away land"". Enjoy 4D movies there and then move to Jurassic Park. There is boat riding and small roller coaster for kids. There is minimum height required , i think 0.90m for boat ride. Same is required at Madagascar. So smaller kids, 2-3 years, really had nothing to do in Universal Studio.So if you are adult, take ""Right"" turn as you enter, with kids take ""Left"" turn.

Entire experience is awesome and you long to come back. Loved the Kingdom of far far away and all the rides in it. Cyclone vs Human roller coaster is one of the most thrilling roller coaster I have ever seen. The Mummy and The Jurassic park were awesome too. The live show of WaterLand is well designed and something should not be missed at all. New attractions of Transformers were awesome. Overall this is the best place for people of all ages to come.

review_342356175,“My dream came true!”,"I went to Sentosa island at 8AM, but The Universal Studios opened at 10AM. I didn't know that, so I walked around this island... When they opened it, I felt like a kid, how excited I was. Everything was so amazing! I tried to play almost games, but after that I went to Egypt town. I kept my bag in locker and I was so careless. I didn't ask the man there clearly. So when I finished this game, I didn't take my bag back. I came to sci fi city to play game. I waited more 90 mins. Coz there were so many people here. After I finish this game, I came back to Egypt town to take my bag. And the locker didn't work out. I asked the man who kept lockers. He stared at me look like I was a criminal. He asked me: "" where was I come from?"" When he knew I was from Vietnam. He scolded me in front of everyone. This was my fault, I had to pay 12S $ to take my bag. But I didn't like his attitude treated me.

As there are all different types. Puss in Boots ,Ancient Eypyt , the Big one. One only problem I found with the whole day was the waiting in lines. One ride wait was an hour and a half for 50 seconds of fun. Would suggest getting a express pass. I think they were $70 dollars.Also the water world show which is on about 1.30 it was awesome.

review_342234996,“Just Amazing”,"We visited Universal Studios at Sentosa with a reasonably sized group (3 families) and I must admit that initially, I was the most reluctant participant.Deferring to our friends wisdom on such maters, we opted to undertake the VIP tour, which upon reflection was a fantastic decision. Although it is about 3 x the cost of a standard entry ticket it enabled us to numerous privleges including no waiting in lines for rides, air-conditioned viewing rooms for shows and meal vouchers for all. It would have taken us 3 x as long to cover what we did in the time had we not had without VIP access and if your not the type to stand in lines, this is a no-brainer.The whole group had a wonderful, completely stress free day and this rates as one of the best investments I made in a long time.

review_342109947,"“Good park, bad staff”","Visited Universal Studios a few days ago.The park itself is great, the theming and rides are fantastic and provide great fun.However, the staff are the rudest people I have ever come across at any theme park. They dont smile, they dont get into the spirit or theme and it kinda puts you off. The cashier in the gift shop didnt even say a word to me once. At the Fairy God Mother's potion shop we queued to get a juice, only to get to told that it was closed when we got to the counter (wasnt even 5 yet). I think the staff need to learn from other theme parks (ie Disney) how to treat its customers.

review_342038517,“Excellent rides let down by poor crowd management and guest services”,"After we arrived I joined the line to get tickets for Universal studios as we have our SIA passes which we show to get free tickets to all of the attractions. I had the passes out in front of me all through the line but got to the front 20 minutes later to be told that those ones have to be done at guest services, another line. A sign would have been nice. We had planned our time to get there early to try to get the big rides done first but ended up getting in about half an hour after it opened.Dallas and Megan went to do the Battlestar Galactica rollercoaster and Reid and I joined the line for Transformers. We agreed to meet about 75 mins later. The estimated wait time had just hit 40 mins which was about my limit. We ended up in line for 52 mins and it would have been longer if not for the fact that they were looking for 2 people to fill a carriage. The ride was excellent - 3D movies interspersed with a moving car and lots of special effects. It took five minutes. By the time we got out it was too late to do another ride as it was just about time to meet Dallas and Megan. When they arrived we learned that they had managed to get 3 rides in. We stayed together for the rest of the day and saw the waterworld show, did a few tame family rides and did the sound stage show which was pretty awesome. It rained quite heavily at one point and cover was extremely sparse outside of the central areas. We hung out under a tree for a bit and then ran for it and found an indoor show. For an attraction in a place where it rains a lot, it is not well set up for rain.I can't help comparing Universal to Disneyworld. The rides are good but the waiting areas are not very well done. I was really annoyed that they do not have wifi as we had no way to communicate with each other and had to arrange meeting points and times which wasted a lot of time. For the amount of money that they charge to get in they should be doing things like wifi to make life easier for guests. Coming from Vietnam where every hole-in-the-wall cafe has wifi, I have been somewhat disappointed in Singapore in this regard. I also thought the express pass system was not well designed and caused a lot of delays to people who did not have them. It is clearly a money making venture rather than any sort of attempt to manage the crowds. The disney fast pass system is far better.

We bypassed so many queues which was great as many of the rides are short, it would have been terrible to have waited 40mins plus for a ride. You can only use the pass once per ride but it means you can go on every single ride! The Rollercoaster, Mummy and Transformer rides were our favourites. There is a great variety of rides and attractions, it made for an awesome day out. I would have loved to have had time to visit the other parks on the island.

review_342010722,“Great for little kids but not so much for adults”,"I found the rides were very slow, short and boring. The only 2 that were entertaining was the mummy and the transformers. Was also disappointed that they closed the roller coasters at 6:40 when the park shuts at 7 we'd been waiting all day for the wait time to get under 80min! Also be aware that they stop the rides if lightening is in the area so check the weather before you go but considering everyday in Singapore is thunderstorms there's probably not much you can do. Definitely a place for kids the rides are very tame and kid friendly and I found they mostly focused on animations and effects but If that's what your into you'll have a blast.
