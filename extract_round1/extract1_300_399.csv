review_341535196,“My 1st trip to universal studios Singapore.”,"Universal studios Singapore exceeded my expectations. I went in thinking it will be an exact replica of the one in L. A but it turned out to be better than the US one. It's quite big so ideally you need min 2 days (more if you've young kids which we did). You've to keep Singapore's weather in mind and if like me you're not used to humidity then plz make sure you have plenty of water on you (preferably electrolyte water) as it can be draining on not just the little ones but adults alike. The wait time for some of the rides was very long and with a not yet 4 year old it was very difficult to wait in the heat. If they could aircondiiton the waiting area it would be much better. You must wear comfortable shoes as all you do is walk and stand. There are plenty of eateries but as usual like all theme parks you can't bring your own and the food is way over priced and pretty unhealthy. In the Singapore heat all you want to do is eat watermelons and other hydrating fruits but I didn't find a single fruit stall:/ weather wise I don't think there is a best time to visit this Plc as we went 2 weeks ago which is supposedly winter but it was beyond hot and humid. In terms of avoiding the crowds the best thing would be to buy the more expensive express ticket which makes you avoid the lines slightly. I didn't know about it and will definitely buy one for next time. There are a lot of rides that are unsuitable for little ones due to age/height restrictions. If you've really young kids I would suggest waiting a few years otherwise it will be a waste. My personal favourite was the transformers ride which is exactly the same as the US one. A must for all the fans and non-fans:) the ""waterworld"" performance was probably the best stunt performance I have seen in any of such parks. I would definitely recommend this theme park if you can brave the heat and humidity then go for it and have a blast;)

review_341488962,“Fabulous place to take the children”,"We travelled as a family (grandparents, 3 adults & 3 children) and went to universal studios for granddaughters 12th birthday. We all had a lot of fun with excellent rides, shows and 4 d movies. The place is spotlessly clean and very organised when lining up for rides. We arrived early when the park opened so the queues were short, they did increase in the afternoon when there were more people there. We all had a wonderful day young and old.

review_341362910,“Great Experience”,"Universal Studio at Sentosa Island was the best experience of my life. Felt like came back to my childhood. All the cartoon character I have seen in my childhood, I can have a picture with them. There is so many things,exciting Rides,Memorising shows, Dance shows by local artists and so much. Felt like I am in a different world, I don't wanna go home. For kids its a paradise. Bit costly but worth it.

review_341334142,“One size (place) fits all”,"This place needs ideally two or three full days of your time if you want to see all the attractions within the universal studios. All kinds of set created for all age groups. It is very well made, maintained. The roller coaster rides are phenomenal for those who love the adrenaline rush.... The ""Transformers"" ride a MUST for all. The real size Bumble bee and Optimus Prime, one cant miss for anything. When my son saw them walk and talk , OMG, his expressions were priceless, absolutely in AWE and DUMBSTRUCK to see his favourites actually walk and talk....Thrilling...Loads of fun for all.

review_341330737,“plan well and have a ball!”,"What not to like! Reach before the park opens and cover the popular rides like Transformers, Mummy, Jurassic Park before the crowd swells. Unfortunately Battlestar Galactica wasnt operational when we visited but I am sure its worth the rush! Avoid weekends to cut the local crowd. Plan well with the help of map and attraction timings that are available at the entrance. Madagascar Boogie, Shrek 4D, water world and Spielberg movie set are a treat as well.

review_341302321,“Great place to spend a full day with family!”,"We spent a full day here with a 7 month old baby. Initially we thought it might be hard to cover the place but it is so well managed and facilitated that you'll never know how time goes by. The rides are first class with some of them topping my all time favourite rides list (Transformers Ride and Revenge of the Mummy - DONT MISS!). I higly recommend buying an unlimited Universal Express pass if you are with family so that you dont spend half the time waiting in queues for the rides. Some queues can last upto 90mins! :)

review_341098578,“Good for family holiday”,"Well, it's universal studios! A bit pricey, but offer many attractions for all family member (except for under 5 yo I suppose).We went here on saturday 9 Jan 2016. We took MRT from esplanade st. to Vivo, but then the queue of Sentosa Express was so long even in 10am. We decided to take bus just outside vivo instead.All of attractions here were well maintained, with street performances here and there to add more fun. Spent whole day here. We can guess which attraction suit for which family member, except for Transformers (really not for little kids!). In afternoon the weather could get hot so don't forget to bring caps.There are many restaurant inside but the food was average. Tips: if you travel with family and stay in area near, like marina or orchard, you'd want to consider to take a cab instead of using public transport. The price difference is not significant plus you get there fast hassle free, maximizing your holiday.

review_341092444,"“Camera, rolling...Action!”","An exciting place to see the huge sets created for the best of the Hollywood flicks! Rides are designed excellently. Lots of walking involved, proper shoes/footware is must. Take a camera to capture the adventure. The sets and ride in section of 'The Mummy', 'Sci-fi City', 'Transformers' are captivating!Avoid a public holiday as the crowding delays your turn and most rides have a waiting time of 30 min to over 60 min.

review_340973169,“Very Interesting”,"The rides were abundant and exciting despite the park's small size. The Battlestar Galactica is a must-try. The park makes it convenient for all rides with safe storage for bags available throughout. Phototaking spots are quite creative. Shows were interesting and interactive, but I think they were more for children. The queues can be devastatingly long, so I suggest going on weekdays. I bought a season pass, so I go to USS very often. The rollercoasters still hook me in, but for people like me the other rides might become redundant.

review_340925588,"“Universal Studios Singapore, from a Filipino back packer”","When visiting Singapore for the first time, you should include Universal Studios to your list. It is a great place to visit especially for families.Be sure to check the time table on the maps as there are street performances that are a must-see. It's okay if you won't be able to watch all of them since other performances overlaps with others. So just pick the ones the you would like to watch.Another good thing about USS is that upon purchasing a ticket online, we were able to get food and shopping discounts.

review_340917788,"“Two times now, and won’t be a third”","I’ve been to Universal Studios Sentosa twice now, both times with my three kids. My first visit was back in 2011 and more recently in November 2015. And both times I really didn’t enjoy it.I love theme parks, and have visited many Disney parks around the world, and also rate the theme parks on Queensland’s Gold Coast quite highly. But Universal Studios just doesn’t cut the mustard.Firstly, there are too many dud rides (like the terrible and outdated Madagascar Ride :O). And then there are just the inexplicable attractions taking up space (like the rock climbing at Jurassic Park). And then there are restrictions on many, many rides that prevented my (tall-for-his-age) 7 year old from enjoying his day. To top it all off, the queues were horrendous both times I visited.And, like I said… I love theme parks so don’t object to queues. But the ride-design should be smart enough to handle the crowds, and these rides are largely just poorly designed.The undoubted highlight was the Transformer Ride… it was extremely clever, totally unique and bizarrely thrilling.

review_340824237,“Fantastic day out”,"I was very excited to be able to go to universal studios, and the park did not disappoint. While there are really only 2 roller coasters for the thrill seekers out there, there are still plenty of rides and shows to keep yOu entertained throughout the day. I loved the transformers ride, as well as puss in boots and the mummy (even though the mummy ride broke down and we were stuck for about an hour in the queue). Food prices at Universal were not too expensive so I was pleasantly surprised. One tip I do have when you are going on the mummy or the battle star galactica coasters is to take at least $6 with you in your pocket, as you need to put your belongings in a locker and if you exceed the free period you will need to pay to open the locker again - which is very difficult if all of your money is inside it.

They could make use of more repairs and maintenance, it is after all the tropics.The rides were great i should and being there on a wednesday morning, the queuing was not bad. We did not have the express ticket but we were able to see all the attractions. I have to say, in 6 hours time though. Needless to say, we planned already for the whole day to spend here. So no problem. if you are short of time and deep pockets, then buy the express ticket as it is worth it. The best ride is the Egytian Mummy in the dark. Was really scary and heart pounding. For the thrill seekers, take the galactica.... wow !!

review_340570947,“Buy multi visit pass for better value”,"We visit Singapore frequently. Last time, instead of going to other attractions, we decided to just go to the universal studio only. We enquired and found out that the studio had half year pass available then, costed us around 100 dollars each. Since, we were there in Singapore for 10 days, if we had visited the studio even just twice, the pass had given us better value compare to buying any other type of tickets. You would not believe, we visited the studio four times during that visit, certainly, not for the whole day every time, but for a few hours each time and did most of the rides, including ride the movie, etc. Note: The food is very expensive in the studio. We went outside for a little while and had lunch in the food court, just next to the universal studio and then went back into the attraction.

review_340335771,“One full day ! ”,"This was our first visit to universal studios and it was amazing! My kid was 11 months old when we were there.There were seven zones one after the other . We entered at Madagascar as we had kids with us. We took two rides.King Julian's beach party-go-round : This had no restriction. A mild ride (merry go round ) and my kid enjoyed this a lot. Madagascar - A crate adventure : This had a height restriction and my kid was not allowed here. So we went separately. It was a boat-ride with Madagascar characters all over the ride. Far far away :The only thing we saw here was shrek 4D adventure . The quality of 4D movie was awesome. Lost world :There were 4 rides here but we picked two as we had to take turns for rides to take care of our little one. Canopy flyer : This ride was good . Our legs hanging down, we take a speed ride in an open rider. Nothing to be afraid about this. We do not feel any giddiness. Jurassic park rapid adventure : This is a water ride . We go by in six-seater tubes . Tube goes in a small canal all through. Some special effects for some time with lights off and dinosaur sounds . At the end, we will be taken to certain height and there will be a sudden drop (not to be so afraid though) . Scifi city:Transformers ride : Best of all the rides in universal studios. We sat in a car like thing which is called evac. The plot goes like this. Optimus prime tries to protect us from decepticons . Decepticons try to damage evac and kill us. This is a 3D ride and we see all the characters through out the ride. We didn't feel the ups and downs in the evac as we were thrilled by the concept. There was another roller coaster too which was under construction in October 2014.We met some characters of transformers live on the streets. We took photographs with Optimus prime, a huge transformer .Ancient Egypt:Revenge of the mummy : This was a dark ride with so many turns. It was the dangerous ride of all. They click a picture of us inside the ride . Not recommended for patients and pregnants and small children . There was a ride called treasure hunters too! But we didn't do it. New York :Lights, camera , action : Its a fabulous show presented by The world famous director Steven Spielberg . He made a brilliant attempt to exhibit the real action behind the screen.Hollywood:Sesame Street: We took our kid here. It was a train ride with animations of sphagetti and characters. It was pleasant. Mels Dinettes: Splendid dance performance by the group.When we were done with all this, we had a surprise waiting on the streets: CHARLIE CHAPLIN . Yeah and he was splendid! We clicked pictures with him. Note : Avoid weekends as it is very crowded. You can take express pass to directly go without any waiting . It costs extra 20$ for all the rides.

The park isn't huge so it's easy to get around without walking forever, but big enough not to feel crowded, food is good with wide choice and prices are good. We stayed at the Swissotel and caught a taxi, only $8, much better than the transfers. The park accepts visa and MasterCard, so no need to carry heaps of cash.You cannot take bags or items in your pocket on the roller coasters, but lockers are next to them, and they are free for 45 minutes.

review_340183383,“Plan Well for A Maximum Fun”,"I went to Universal Studio Singapore on my 2nd day in the island. Since I brought my 3 kids (11yo - 10yo - 7yo) so I've made a little research through the internet on do's and don'ts for a maximum fun. And as I experienced it myself, I'd like to share it with you all.* It is more comfortable to go there when the peak season is over. And if possible, go there on weekdays. Avoid weekends, although you'll miss the parades & fireworks that only appears on Saturday.* Buy tickets online for time saving and sometimes you can get special discount.* Wear comfortable clothes since it is very hot & humid. Buckled sandals are better than loose sandals or shoes, since there are some attractions that can make you wet from head to toe.* Go there as soon as the park is open at 10am.* Don't forget to take the map and the schedule at the park entrance, so you won't miss the show & character meet & greet. The schedule is different from time to time.* Rides the favorite attractions first: Transformers, Battlestar Galactica (Human or Cylon), Revenge of the Mummy, Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure, Waterworld (show). As for me and my kids, first we ride Transformers at Sci-Fi City. Although it's already low season but the queuing time still takes about 40 minutes. But the ride was worth it!* If you want to skip regular queues, buy Universal Express or Universal Express Unlimited.* Drink lots of water to stay hydrated.* Stay at nearby hotels at Sentosa if you want to spend a lot of time visiting most of attractions at Resort World Sentosa (Universal Studio, S.E.A Aquarium, Adventure Cove Waterpark, Trick Eye Museum, Madame Tussaud, etc) for time & energy saving.

We enjoyed the Christmas theme still running on New Year's Day. One day wasn't enough once you take in queue times, most rides had a one hour queue time...a few had over 2 hours.

An express pass negates that waiting the longest we waited was 10mins for a ride. It is nicely presented did see some characters, minions,woody wood pecker, Frankenstein,Betty bop and Marolyn Munro and a life size transformer. Food is theme park prices there is plenty of variety.

review_339866154,“amazing universal studio....”,"Went the first week of January and it was quiet and a great day out for all the family. Impressed as to how much they have packed into a small space without it feeling cramped.I would definitely recommend this park to all families because of how easy it is to move around the theme park and the rides are much more thought out and creative in terms of the themes used the ride. A great example is the Jurassic park Water ride. The Jurassic park ride compared to any other log flume ride in the world is so much more entertaining, exciting and extravagant. The rides in general are much more unique. We went there at the start of this year and the lines didn't have that long of a wait time. I do recommend you get the superpass to avoid massive lines.

review_339858487,“Great Theme Park for the Family”,"Situated at the Sentosa Entertainment Complex, getting to the Universal Studios was a breeze. Be warned, leaving Sentosa Island at peak hours can mean waiting at the taxi stand for a long time!Even though the park itself is rather compact, it is much better organised than a lot of the other ones in Asia. The different areas are well marked, and one can cut through some of them easily (especially when travelling with your children, or when the weather turns foul).The rides are suited for all ages with some height restrictions imposed on the faster/scarier ones. If you can afford it or travelling with young children, go for the Fast Pass, the money is well worth it.

review_339823848,“Great day out”,"We arranged a one way transfer and tickets to Universal Studios at home before we left for Singapore. There was plenty to see and do. Even though we had a very wet day there, apart from the big roller coaster rides, we found most things were under cover and we still enjoyed the day immensely. We had a crate adventure which was a river boat ride with Alex Marty, Gloria, and Melvin. My daughter and Husband took the Puss In Boots’ Giant Journey suspended coaster ride and even though they got saturated (due to the rain) loved it. We walk down the Hollywood Boulevard and browsed through the stores. We also enjoyed the 4D Shrek Movie Adventure. We left by taxi and even though there was a long queue, it was very orderly and taxis came quite frequently. We took the short drive to Vivo City ( A hugh Shopping Centre) which you can easily walk to from Sentosa Island. There was also the MTR (Train) or Bus that could have been taken. We had a great day out.

review_339804748,“Ok not great”,"Took my 7 and 10 year old boys. I thought the basic ticket prices were quite reasonable but the express ticket prices were $150 for the 3 of us. Expensive ! But... There was no way I wanted to spend an hour queuing for a 5 minute ride. Anyway it turns out that neither of the boys wanted to go on any roller coasters or do the transformers ride but even the less exciting rides had long queues. There was one ride that looked good in Jurassic park that we could not use it for so was disappointed and so we didn't bother as the queue was 30 mins. Other than that park was smaller than I expected, and had less rides than I expected and I certainly would not go to a theme park again. Waterworld show almost made up for the expense- it was excellent !!!

review_339804377,“A great day out!”,"We only had one full day in Singapore and my husband and I decided to hit up Universal Studios to round off our trip in Asia. It was great fun! Tickets were $74 Singapore dollars +$50 Singapore dollars for the universal express pass, which lets you skip rides an unlimited amount of times (as opposed to the express pass for $30 which lets you skip queues once per ride). Despite being the quiet period (January, once everyone is back at work and school), we found the universal express pass well worth the extra money. The best rides of the park are Transformers 4D ride (by far!), the Cyclone half of the BattleStar Galactica roller coaster, the Mummy Crate ride (although don't waste your life queuing up for the Mummy ""Treasure Hunt"" ride!) and the Jurassic Park rapid river ride. All were good fun! The food at Universals Studio was average but I guess that's normal at theme parks. A good day of fun! Getting there is really easy but a bit of a walk from the train station.

review_339778631,“Nothing overly special”,"This is colloquially known as Asia's #1 theme park - which it probably is - although some peoples' views may differ. It is a super small park and you should be able to go on just about every ride in as little as 3 hours on an off peak day. The park is great for solo travelers as you don't have to wait as long on some rides and won't need a pass to jump the queue.There are only a couple of thrill rides and roller coasters for those thrill seekers and is probably a more family oriented park. The best roller coaster is the blue Battlestar Galactica ride. The Jurassic Park Rapids would have to be one of the best rapid rides you have gone on, it is themed well and you almost feel you're in the movies. The Mummy ride is really exciting - although quite short in duration - and the Transformers ride definitely wakes you up. You get a great view of Singapore and the docks from the new Puss and Boots ride, but the ride itself isn't the worst but is more for younger families, same with the Jurassic Park sky way. The Madagascar boat ride is also great for young children, and the little Shrek roller coaster too.Like just about every theme park in the world, it is not smart to come here on peak days, as cues for rides can be longer than an hour and you will only end up going on 4 rides for the whole day. Even the access pass to jump the queue can be long, but obviously not as long so if you do go when it is holidays it is wise to get the pass. Overall, Universal Singapore isn't too cheap (around $70 Singapore dollar) considering its size and number of thrill rides. But if you like theme parks it still good to go but you probably wouldn't rush back once you have been. So, nothing overly special, recommend coming on an off peak day and personally I wouldn't even consider going during School Holidays.

review_339774385,“Don't go without the express pass”,"This place is great for family and friends. The atmosphere from when you enter the gate is excitement and that's what i got most out of the visit. Even though it was a rainy day, the staff were helpful and all the rides were open. Having said that, there is at least an hour wait for all rides. Going without the express pass is madness if you don't value your time. Most of the big boys rides were an hour and a half wait and only go for less than a 60 seconds. All in all great positive experience but definitely would not feel the same if i had paid for just a standard ticket.

review_339524879,“Great family fun”,"So the rides might not be up to the same level of thrills as Universal in Orlando (that said, my boys loved the blue Battlestar Glactica one!) and it might be a fraction of the size, but there's still a lot of fun to be had at USS. Having just one day here we invested in the Unlimited Express passes which allowed the boys to continuously by pass the queues for the main roller coaster and make the most of their day. Also recommend the water show. If you don't have an express pass and love your roller coasters arrive before opening and head straight for the Battlestar Galactica ride or risk very long wait times. We came mid week when crowds weren't too bad but it can apparently get very busy on the weekends.

review_339513836,“Great park – but way too popular”,"We visited on the last day of the year – along with what seemed a million other people. With queues for rides averaging 90 minutes plus – we felt we had no choice but to purchase Express Passes for everyone, costing another $70 each on top of the admission price. This felt like a rip off, but at least it allowed us to complete all the rides by the end of the day. When we were there, it looked unlikely that anyone could do this without buying one. Apart from all the people, we had a good time. If we had decided not to get Express Passes, we would have spent hours waiting in long lines and left very disappointed.

My kid enjoyed so much meeting up all his fav characters like minions, Santa Claus, Madagascar cast, Shrek & Fiona & Pinocchio, Dinosaurs and his most favourite Bumble Bee & Optimus Prime. There were long queues for most rides so we couldn't do all. You can spend the entire day here and you wouldn't know where the day went! The rides and the theme parks are amazing as are the stunt and special effects shows. Try to see as much as possible and take a map and the meeting schedule of the characters to plan accordingly. If you buy the Express tickets, you may be able to do all rides but not with toddlers or elderly. Food options are ample and each food court is made according to the theme park you are at which is fantastic. It rains quite suddenly here so be prepared.

review_339009045,“Annual pass holder - good rides but a rip off”,"I've held an annual express pass for 2 years because I live in Singapore and it's an easy way to spend a couple of hours on a Sunday with a young family.The daily tickets are expensive and the food and drink is poor and over priced. RWS tries every trick in the book to extract more money out of you. On rides where you can't take a bag because it will get wet or fall off they make you pay $4 to rent a locker for an hour. If you've already spent over $200 bringing your family into the park I would expect this to be complimentary.Also, on the Jurassic Park ride they make a big deal out of telling you that you will get wet - not everybody does. They then sell you overpriced plastic macs which they then throw away. It would be very simple for them to save all of this non biodegradable plastic being sent into land fill. They could allow people to reuse them for free. Rather than save its customers money and do a little something to reduce their impact on the environment , RWS would rather make a fast buck out of customers who have already paid a small fortune for a day out.

The park was busy (as is to be expected) but with the express passes don't think we queued for longer than 10 minutes on any ride, outstanding. The park is smaller than its US counterpart (so I am told), with an express pass you can go round everything once in around 4 hours, but its nice to take your time, get your photo with the Minions , do your favourite rides twice and just enjoy the atmosphere. A great day out.

review_338633124,“Day visit to Universal Studios”,"A must visit attraction in Singapore. I would advise you to buy the premium unlimited pass which costs approximately as much as the ticket but gives you access to queue jump. The price of the premium pass is based on the demand and usually keeps on increasing closer it gets to your visit. Having this pass could enable you to cover almost all the attractions in a day. Otherwise queueing time is about an hour on the popular rides. Universal studio is a paradise for thrill seekers. Attractions such as transformers are excellent, with outstanding special effects. Lastly, don't miss the water world show. Its a 20-30 min show with unbelievable stunts and action.

review_338562164,“Something for everyone”,"Plenty to see and do. Spent some time in the queues so I would recommend the additional $50 express pass so you can get try all the rides or ride your favourites more frequently. Didn't see the pamphlet for the show timings - may have missed it. Would have helped coord viewing the shows. Monorail ride from the main Island to Sentosa at $4pp is well worth it. Free return ride.

review_338525192,“Those with pecuniary anxieties should steer well clear!”,"It's ironic that a store named The Dark Room can be found on your right soon after you enter Universal Studios at Singapore. All manner of photographic accessories can be purchased there; however, if you harbour outlandish thoughts of photographing much more than the boulevard itself or the sky above you may well be disappointed. From the outset, humourless employees became animated at my attempts to capture the faces of my excited children even though we were only queueing for the Madagascar ride! ""No video. No video!"" Pecuniary advantage may be par for the course when theme parks are being considered but Universal Studios, Singapore not only managed this but threw in monumental servings of officiousness too. If it wasn't bad enough being rebuked for unavoidably aiming a lens in the direction of the attractions, one particularly miserable individual even took umbrage at the fact that we were consuming a pack of chips which weren't purchased within the confines of Universal's shakedown juggernaut. $11 for a hotdog? Despite the theme park's appalling prices and the niggardly approach of some of it's employees, my children thoroughly enjoyed themselves. My son was particularly keen to enjoy Transformers: The Ride and he'd been looking forward to it for months. Sadly, it broke down barely two minutes into the fun and we had to trek across the tracks and exit through the bowels of the building. Still, at least we were extended the courtesy of a verbal apology in a rare outing of Universal good manners.

review_338503900,“Fun but not for the whole family”,"USS is fun for bigger kids and adults. It's not quite advisable to go if you have a younger child since the child won't be able to go on most of the rides and you can't really leave them behind alone. Lines are really long so if you have the budget for it, splurge for the Express Pass so you can maximize the experience.

We went there on Christmas day and were greeted with a crowd like i had never seen before. All the great rides had a waiting time of more than 70 mins. Others still had longer waiting times than you would like. Because of the waiting, one misses out on character meet and greets etc that is going on outside.Now , transformers is a fantastic ride and one with huge waiting times. Similarly battlestar galactica is a great ride with a big waiting problem.The solution to the problem? go to the park on a working day and reach there early. By early I mean as early as 9:30 - 10:00 AM. Apart from queues, it is a place where the fantasies of a fanboy /fangirl come true. For that, it is worth the wait !!

We got there by taxi, and from Bugis it cost around S$12-20. The theme park is not that big, you can finish it in one day specially if there are no lines in major attractions. For us best seller is the 'Transformer the ride', a 3D ride, line usually takes 15-30mins. Other attraction that we enjoyed are Sesame street show, Lights, camera, action a hollywood movie set up, Shrek, River cruise, Madagascar, Water world and the new one Puss in Boots giant which we did not have the chance to ride cause its raining that time. The rest are basic rides which you can find in other theme parks like carousel or train ride. The place is highly recommended as it was one of singapores tourist attraction.

I would recommend that you find out before going if your smallest child is 120cm or over, as this is the minimum hight for a lot of rides. Also our day would not have been as good if we didn't purchase ultimate fast pass tickets. They are an additional 75 SGD on top of your ticket per person, but the lines (if we didn't have it) had minimum of an hour waiting time, to go on them once. We just walked in and the longest we had to wait was 3.5 minutes and we could go on the same ride multiple times. It made the day fun, and the children (4,7,18) and us oldies had a happy, carefree, non stressful day, and we got to see everything and go on everything, which wouldn't have happened if we had to line up.We were really suprised, if you wanted your photo taken with a character, the professional photographer took a photo (to sell you) and also asked you if you would like them to take a photo for you with your own camera. The day was not expensive (other than tickets and ultimate fast pass tickets, which you can purchase online in advance). Great full day of fun!! PS: you can also get normal fast pass tickets for an extra $50 p.p (on top of entry ticket) this allows you 1 fast track to each ride.

Otherwise, the rest of the rides were suitable for children and family for a weekend getaway. There were many food kiosks and restaurants that are great for chilling if you have ran out of rides. My only rant is that the photo-taking session is pretty limited with each mascot coming out only about 20 minutes. Hence, you have to plan your time well if you want to take photos with them.Understood from the staff that the after 5pm promotion has ended, hence its advisable to just get the annual/half year pass to re-enter any time.

The different is with the regular express pass you just can do one express entry/attraction and the unlimited as many you want.But as the park was so slow when we entered we just paid for the limited one.You can always upgrade your express pass during your day at guest service if wanted.So we went for the normal que as long the park was slow and after lunch we used the express pass.The express passes is often cheaper in the morning than after lunch, the price dynamic depending on how crowded the park is.This park is worth every cent... DO NOT MISS THIS

review_337159182,“Extremely crowded at holidays”,"Should be expected, probably, but with crowds and waiting time of 2 hrs per attraction and intermittent closure due to rains and lighting, you have to double the time allowance. New Year eve was very good - a lot of performances and fun. Fireworks were quite OK (but not stunning)Food is junk, though

review_337137673,“Plan well and get an Express pass for a good experience”,"I visited Universal Studios twice in 2015. The place itself is quite small and can be easily covered in one day if you plan well. The first time I visited was in early November and although I had made a list of the must do rides and also the order in which I was going to do them, I ended up missing the Donkey live and water world show and also the mummy ride. I did not anticipate a lot of crowd and so I did not purchase express passes beforehand. After waiting for 40 mins early in the day for the Jurrassic Rapid ride, I decided to purchase the express pass. Unfortunately after lunch the crowds can get heavy even in express queues. Even with the express pass for the second half of the day, I was not able to complete all the rides. During my second visit on Dec 26th, I purchased the express pass in advance and started in the express queues for all rides and I was able to finish all of them - I rode some of them twice - the mummy and the transformers. I followed a TripAdvisor user wicaxon's suggestions - rode in the same order as suggested in the review. The ratings given to the rides in the review are also spot on. We traveled as a couple. If you are travelling with young children, there may only be a few rides for the kids - which is also mentioned in the review.Here is the user Wicaxon's review with suggestions: https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294264-d2439664-r151083155-Universal_Studios_Singapore-Sentosa_Island.htmlHere are some suggestions to get the best out of your trip:1) if you are traveling as a couple or with friends and you want to ride on all the attractions, get an express pass.2) arrive ahead of time - by 9:30 a.m. The monorail queues at VivoCity may be long on holidays. On 26th Dec there was a 1 hr wait time to board the mono rail to Sentosa. Skip the monorail - you can take a cab from HarbourFront station for 4$ to Sentosa.3) USS is normally open from 10 to 6. But in the holiday season - Christmas/New Year, it is open from 10 a.m to 9.30 p.m. on select days. If you are visiting in the holiday season, make sure you watch out for this window. It gives you so much more time to enjoy at the park. Plus they have some Christmas special shows for kids in the holiday season. If you are looking to visit Sentosa in the holiday season, please do. We were initially skeptical about visiting during the holiday season fearing the huge crowds - but there is an additional 3.5 hrs for you to ride the attractions and there are extra runs of the staged shows during this time. The day we visited -26th Dec 2015 - the park was crowded, but still We got to ride all the attractions- every single one of them including even the kidsmerry-go-round :)4) follow the link to a another user's review above and take the rides and shows in that order. Plan your big roller coasters earlier in the day and do the staged shows - Shrek 4D, Water World and Steven Speilberg show - after lunch. 5) immediately after you enter the park, grab hold of a map and a pamphlet with show times for the staged shows. Some of these shows run once every hour - Shrek 4D, Sesame Street - while others have specific show times. So, at the start of your day at USS, plan your timings for these shows. 6) don't waste time taking photographs with Disney characters and at the different theme locations early in the day - that is unless you don't want to ride on any attractions. The photo-ops are available all throughout the day and you can do them after lunch.The tickets to USS are quite expensive at $74 for an adult plus a 50$ for express. So, plan well the attractions you want to ride and the order in which you are going to do them. I regretted not planning thoroughly the first time where 74$ + 50$ almost went down the drain. It is quite a small place and you can do it all in a day if you plan well in advance.Here's the order we took:1) Jurrassic Rapids ride2) Human3) Cylon4) TransformersLunch5) Shrek 4D6) Steven Speilberg Lights Camera Action7) Revenge of the Mummy8) Puss in boots ride9) Water world at 4.30 p.m10) Enchanted airways11) Madagascar crate ride12) Accelerator13) Transformers 2nd time14) Mummy 2nd time15) King julien's carousel 16) Canopy ride17) Dino soarinEateries:We tried oasis cafe at Egypt-theme (Indian food) - not great but not badThere are ice cream/ ice lolly and juice stalls all over the park.What to wear and what to carry:Wear comfortable loose clothing as the temperatures can be quite high in the afternoon. bring an umbrella. It was quite hot the day we went and we were walking with the umbrella from one attraction to the other. Bring a cap and a pair of sunglasses. Wear running shoes - you may have to walk around a lot. Don't wear them to your Rapids ride, though. They may get wet. You will get wet in Jurrassic rapid ride - carry a poncho or buy one for 2$ before you join the queue. The poncho machines near the queues only take 1$ or 2$ coins.You can bring packed food from outside/home. There are no restrictions about what you can carry in terms of food. We took a few cereal bars and a water bottle. There are drinking water kiosks all over the park. You need not carry a lot of water with you.Lockers: the lockers outside ""mummy"" ride were free for the first 45 mins. Reach early to get hold of one of those.

review_337114608,“Excellent day”,"My family and I went on 29 December and it was extremely busy with most lines over an hour but we had the fast pass which is really worth the money. The Transformers ride was amazing and I think the best ride in the park. It is worth bundling the Universal trip as part of a package with other attractions in Singapore like the aquarium or waterpark. We did this and it saved a family of 5 over 200.

review_337094578,"“Good, no need to get there early”","The island is pretty far but you can get there early by bus. They kinda stick it to you with a 4 dollar ticket to rise the monorail otherwise you can walk almost 1.5 km which is kinda far. The park itself is very clean and charges the usually high amusement park rates but that's to be expected of any amusement park. You can see the whole thing and ride almost every ride in about five hours. The lines aren't that long especially as it gets on in the day but that may just be the very early January season. It's a good park to visit but eat before and wait to eat again until after

There was lots of entertaining stuff to do for even people like me who didn't like roller coasters. We went for Transformer which was a 3D simulator ride first. The queue was about 40 mins for single riders and double that for the group. After that, we went on 3 other rides and ended the day around 8:30pm. The special thing about going during Christmas is that the rides open until 9pm. After being exhausted with all the adrenaline, we went shopping along Main Street and bought souvenirs. It felt like I was a kid again. Totally enjoyed it!

review_336706704,“extremely busy and definitely need to pay the extra $90 for unlimited express lines”,"Went 1st January expecting crowds to be down - not likely as it was very vey busy. Some rides between 45' and 1 hr + unless you had an express pass. Brought grandkids express passes so that they got to enjoy many rides over the day and had a great experience. Factor in paying the admission charge ($74) plus the express pass of $90 per person otherwise you will spend most of the day in lines and queues.. The experience was great not as good as Universal Studios in Orlando, but still well worth the trip - note January is the wet season and it should rain at some stage during the day. For 1st time I hired an electric wheelchair ($50) - (wife needs one) and found it great, besides saving your legs, you always has a seat - recommend it no matter what age you are.

review_336587821,"“Good day out with kids, get an Express pass but expect queues!”","Fun attraction in Sentosa - 10/15 minute taxi ride from the city. It's not a huge park, so you can get in and out in 4-5 hours if you plan your day. In my opinion it's worth getting an Express pass add on for $50-$70 per adult (not required for kids), as in most instances this saved us anywhere from 30-75 minutes per ride on our visit (Saturday, New Years long weekend). If you don't want to pay the extra, then make sure you are at the park around 9:30/9:45 (in advance of the 10am opening), and plan your day so you head to the popular rides first when queues are short (Revenge of the Mummy, Enchanted Airways, Battlestar) and then to Lost World (Jurassic Park Rapids, Canopy Flyer) when that section opens at 11am. Plenty of food outlets - as well as beer! Do your research if you have young kids - a lot of rides have height restrictions which can be found on the website. Fun day, do your prep, and make the most of your time so you can enjoy the rest of it. And dress well for walking, and getting wet on a lot of the rides!

Light-Camera-Action is a must show. Other theatrics shows are also good.Mummy ride and Transformer ride elevates the mood and you would want to do it multiple times. An express pass in worth the money. It is costly but you would know the importance after you experience the difference - a 2 hours queue versus an immediate to 10 mins wait for ride with an express park, especially on weekends and PH.Human and Cylons are two giant roller coaster ride. Cylon will give you pure adrenaline rush and is the best ride of the park, though I tried it after lot of pushing by friends.Far Far East Castle and 4D Shrek show are treat to eyes. Kids would enjoy it. Madagascar and Carousel are two other rides were family along with smaller aged kids would enjoy.Their are few eatery options also including for vegetarians.

Would not encourage to go if you are not going with kids as the visit could be rather tense having to rush for shows and entry is always given to people who purchased priority pass, they do not have separate queue, thus even they come half an hour later than you, they still get in first and if your turn and quota full for show, you would still gain no entry.

review_336142176,“Excellent Place for Kids and Adults alike ! You need to have watched the movies to enjoy completely !!”,"We have been to Universal Studios in the USA and now to Singapore. There are very minor differences which are really negligible. Its an amazing theme park with so many rides for the kids and adults. Tip for a totally enjoyable experience - watch the movies before you visit the park. One cannot enjoy if you haven's seen Shrek, Transformers, Mummy, Madagascar etc. Kids will total fun when they know the characters !!

review_336113056,“Hyped up place”,"Went around Halloween. There were many shows or buildings closed maybe due to renovation or maybe because they want to take a break and open at night. There is a crowd as I was there in the late morning. Do go in the afternoon or evenings when the weather is cooler. There aren't any rides suitable for seniors except the Madagascar ride. They had a great team taking care of the seniors in my family.There were queues everywhere and not much place to sit and rest in the shade. This is a waste-money place. Everywhere you go, there are kiosks and canteens charging very much expensive prices for everything. Bring your sunglasses, umbrella, portable stool, sandwiches, juices so that you can have a break under the shade. I would recommend not going at all if you have seniors. Save the money and don't spend your money at all for the tickets to this scam.

review_336113045,"“If you want to ""test"" your patience then this is the place to go!”","Totally over rated... queues everywhere for everything! Length of queues went from 35 mins to 3 hours for the sought after attractions! (most queues seemed to be around 2 hours) So even through we arrived at opening time, by 6pm we'd only managed to get on 4 rides! Of course there are the express tickets but these are upwards of $70 a ride so makes it a super pricey day if you wish to go that way. The rides that we did do were short and compared to Universal in the USA a real disappointment. We won't be coming back and if we are ever in Sentosa again we'd opt to do specific activities like IFly, etc where you have a specific time. I appreciate this was likely the worst time to go but they need to limit entry to the park to make it more enjoyable.

review_336103726,“Amazing rides - good shows”,"USS is a full day of fun and rides. The place has something for all age groups.Avoid holiday season and weekends if you can because it gets really crowded and some of the rides could have a waiting time of upto 2 hours (or you could buy the Universal Express Ticket to cut through the lines, HOWEVER, I think the Universal Express does not help you on the 4/5 high speed roller coasters where the wait times are higher).Travel light - ladies avoid carrying handbags... on some roller coasters you will have put away the bags in the lockers. There are 4 in the park... most are chargeable. the ones in Ancient Egypt are not for a certain time period (~45 minutes) ;-)I loved the ""Far Far Away"" the most. There is also a ""Waterworld show"" there are 3 shows every day. DO NOT MISS THE WATERWORLD SHOW.On the rides, revenge of the mummies in ancient egypt, canopy flyer in lost world, puss the boots in far far away and inter galactic rides are not to be missed. the blue inter-galactic is not for the faint hearted. watch the ride before you board the blue one.

review_335899991,“Not a must do at all”,"Really disappointing experience. This park is small but well laid out however it cannot seem to cope efficiently with the volume of people!!! Lines were ridiculously long - waited for blue roller coaster for over 2 hours! If you can afford an express ticket I would suggest you do so however we were quoted $70 per express ticket for a one time ride on each ride or $90 per express ticket for unlimited. As a family of 4 in addition to the $300 admission price, it simply was not affordable at all. Be warned of many people pushing in and cutting the queue - I had enough and told one of the staff and they made them go to the back of the line. Another queue jumper and while staff member had a go at them, they still managed to get on before us - very unfair considering we are all waiting a very long time.We got there just before 10am and headed straight for the Transformer ride - we waited 1.5 hours as the ride 'had technical difficulties' (how this happens so early and how this wasn't detected prior to opening I do not understand). The ride was enjoyable and probably our favourite. We left at 5pm and had only managed to get on 3 rides. Very disappointing and I feel ripped off. One ride (the red roller coaster) had a wait time of 145 minutes!!!! While we went on a fine (albeit very hot day) - be advised if the weather is rainy - the outdoor rides will not operate.We caught the MRT to Harbour Front and then caught the monorail ($4 return) from Vivocity level 3 to Sentosa. Depending on the time you leave, the line to wait to leave Sentosa for the monorail can exceed 30 minutes and when you have been waiting all day - it just makes you further annoyed.If you are short on time, give this a miss - plenty of other wonderful, more affordable places to go in Singapore.

As with other US parks, Transformers, The Mummy and the Jurassic Park Rapids are quality productions. Human and Cylon are good thrillseeking coasters but more adventurous riders will be left with not much else to do. Express passes are worth the extra cost during peak periods.

review_335388399,“Full day of fun”,"We arrived early and made a full day of it. We decided to purchase Express Passes when we entered the park. As the day progressed we agreed that the additional cost was well worth it! Top recommendations:- Arrive at the park early (before the gates open). There will be a long queue. We (group of four) travelled by taxi to and from Sentosa. If you stay at the park until closing time, prepare yourself for a long queue at the taxi rank. - Consider purchasing an Express Pass. Ride wait times can be reduced dramatically. - Take snacks/ packed meal and a water bottle. The food within the park zones are themed. The 'cuisine' that you feel like eating may be on the other side of the park when meal times come along. There are places to fill up your bottle. - Check out the show times, and plan your day around these. - Our favourite rides included: The Mummy, Transformers, Battlestar Galactica, and the water ride in The Lost World zone (we got soaking wet on this ride!). I would recommend purchasing one of the ponchos, or taking this ride early in the day on a sunny day so that have time to dry off. The Steven Spielberg special effects demo (I've forgotten the name) was insightful. - Utilise the lockers provided as you progress through the park. You will need coins. - Make some time to wander the streets of Hollywood. Enjoy!

review_335161812,"“LONG lines without express tickets, very disappointing”","We are amusement park fans, and were really looking forward to a day at Universal Studios - Singapore. The park was impressively laid out, and the decorations for Christmas were wonderful. However, on our very first ride, Transformers: The Ride, after waiting for over 30 minutes, we were told that there was a delay, and after another 15 minutes, they closed the ride. Luckily, my husband asked for express tickets so we could avoid the long lines when it repopened. About 45 minutes later, we waited 40 minutes for Jurassic Park Rapids and the same thing happened! At least this time, the ride started up again after 15 minutes, but really, two rides out of the first few rides we rode on?! The wait times for the rides were crazy long. Some rides offered single riders, which was a good idea, but not all of them, which was crazy. Express line people got in very quickly, but for us, we probably averaged 50-55 minutes per ride. It definitely takes away the enjoyment of an amusement park when all you do is wait for a two minute ride, many of which were let downs. However, when we returned to the Transformers ride, we got on in about 10 minutes, which was awesome, and the ride was a blast! If we could have done that on all the rides, our experience would have been so much different. The park brochure offered one tip for getting on rides faster: buy an express ticket!! It was such a let down. The tickets weren't cheap, so adding the extra cost of express tickets just wasn't in the cards. We had it by 6:00 pm, and then had to wait another 30 minutes for a taxi back to your hotel!!! Lines, lines, lines.

review_335129150,“Poor Staff Training and Profits above Welfare”,"I've been to USS twice and both times witnessed very poor staff attitude. The host/hostess all have glum faces as if they were forced to work and I saw them shouting/barking at guests who did not queue according to their instructions. Management should walk around or do under-cover surveillance. Is labour crunch so tight that USS Singapore have to employ part-time students with little training or QC? The experience from the staff at the F1 or the Sports Hub is so different, everyone there smiling and eager to help.On my second visit, it was a packed Friday so we paid $50 for the Express Pass, but the Express Passes were sold in an uncontrolled manner so even the Express queues were about 45 minutes to an hour even though the announcements were that it's 5 to 15 minutes. The estimated queue timings (for both Express and non-Express queues) are always grossly understated.The fact that USS chose to adopt the useless NEA Lightning Warning System also heaps further misery on the queuing time, and I queued for an hour (Express Pass) only to learn the Battlestar Galactica Ride will be closed due to LWS. Now, NEA started this LWS nonsense and say it is up to vendors to follow, but with such a system in place, vendor cannot not follow because of legal ramifications. But do exercise common sense, the LWS is too conservative and have a 99.999999999% false alarm rate. On that day when they close the ride I was about to board, there is no rain or lightning anywhere near RWS, but NEA being over-cautiously put up a 'lightning forecast icon' within 8 km radius of USS, and hence, the ride was closed. How stupid is that!!Anyway, on days where the queues exceed a certain timing, express passes and new walk-in admissions should be stopped. Don't just think of profits. Leave the profit-making to the Casino and do not, in any way, spoil the fun of those who come to USS for the fun. And please stop following the LWS, use your own professional judgement to decide on Lightning Risk.

review_334951189,“Wonderful experience”,"We had a good time. We had been in the peak season and on a Monday.Egyptian Mummy, Transformers and Jurassic park were my favourites among all. I had been to similar rides, but, this was by far the best.Among other rides were Madagascar, Canopy, water world etc.I also loved the shows of Shrek and Steven Spielberg hurricane show. It's a good timeout place with family or friends. Tips:1. 1 day may not be enough to cover all. Plan our prioritize accordingly2. On a rush day when expected guest count is high, priority ticket is advisable. For 10-15min ride, wait time is from 45 mins to 90 mins in normal queue

review_334902102,“An adventurous trip”,"Last Sunday we had a family trip to universal studios at sentosa. The first thing I learnt was avoid Sunday's or opt for universal express ticket in addition to admission ticket.Every ride was so crowded as it was school holiday time. But as it was festive time universal studios were open till 9pm with all rides. There was a Christmas fireworks at 9.30 pm which continue everyday till Dec 30th,2015.Since we went with our little girl, the first ride was Madagascar boat ride. Good .Next was a carousel which last for just 1min.So highly disappointed. Next was Far Far away.Don't miss the puss in the boots and enchanted airways.The shrek 3d adventure and donkey show was lovely. Try to sit at last as they are moving seats.Next was lost world. Don't miss the canopy flyer, Rapid adventure and dinosarin. Revenge of the mummy is great but children must be at least 122cm to ride.Next was sci fi city, Transformers we totally loved it. Terrific. Then you Steven Spielberg's light camera action, great. Next was Sesame street space world. Don't miss the battle star galactica, we did not ride as my girl was not allowed.Do check the universal studios website where they have a separate file about height requirement for each ride and conditions. So you can plan your ride before you go. Since it was open till 9pm my girl enjoyed the rides many times. Catch a glimpse at Madaonna in Hollywood. We also enjoyed the Christmas dance show at 9pm. In the end it turned out be an awesome day.

review_334874677,“Best Place to Be in East Asia”,"Universal Studios were the only thing missing in the tiny but precious island of Singapora! There are 12 rides that are matchless. If you are solo or in an odd number group, take the advantage of the Single Rider and you skip the often-long queue for the rides. Don't miss the visit to the studios. Hold your camera tight -where it is allowed- as the experience is shocking. Outside foods and drinks are not allowed. And the quality of the food there is not better than any other theme park in the world. Spare a full day for the park. Seeing Sentoza itself is another adventure so do not combine your Universal Studio adventure with anything else in the same day.

review_334855134,“magical fireworks”,"it is my third time visiting USS and here are some tips based on my observations if you want to plan well:1. if you can, avoid peak periods in June, December, public holidays and weekends.2. if #1 cannot be met, i suggest getting an Express pass which entitles you to priority queues for the rides. the queue time during peak period can be from 30-90 mins after which they will accept no new riders until the queue is cleared.i have been to USS w/o express pass during a weekend and on Halloween night, as well as with an express pass during christmas wk. personally i felt that the express pass saved me a lot of stress and boredom from long queues and waiting. it can be very pressuring to rush from ride to ride so that you can cover the entire park within a visit and i realised i experienced less fatigue with an express pass. walking and taking rides are fun and doesn't consume much energy, but waiting and queuing actually makes you tired coupled with the pressure of limited time.3. of course the express pass doesnt come cheap but it buys you time and convenience. if you are unwilling to pay and have to visit during peak period, then here is a compromised option: visit USS at 10am sharp. the rides have nearly zero -15 mins wait time from 10-1130am. conquer these essential rides and be quick: transformers, the mummy, jurassic park rapids. make sure you finish these rides first before proceeding to the next series which are less exciting but still gd: canopy flyer, enchanted airways, puss in bootsafter which you can spend the afternoon queueing for the other rides and shows.4. bring a poncho if you dont want to get wet during the lost world rapid ride.5. purchase your tickets online.-----------------------other views:i really enjoyed the xmas fireworks, it was magical. :)

review_334745921,“Christmas day visit”,"So, this time I will write the review just with the summary of most important tips for travelers before and during visit:-If planning to spend christmas day at Singapore, Universal Studios will be a great and different way if want to experience something different away from the traditional western experience, but do not expect to see Santa, after all remember that that this is Singapore so Christmas is not a big event here-Plan to buy tickets in advaced to skip lines, some agencies like Asia Travel or even Mastercard will offer discounts of up to 10 SD-Plan to arrive as early as 9:30 this should be enough to pick up tickets and look around get familiar with the area and enter at 10:00-December is a highly rainy month so bring a poncho or something to cover or you can just purchase before the main gate, you will need it either for the day or some rides-Not sure about the express pass??? in my experience if you arrive early, you are not in a rush, only want to ride probably once the main rides and plan to spend the whole day, then don't buy, all day is enough to ride them all once but plan to spend from 15 up to 70 minutes on the line-Now, you are with kids, planning to hit the rides more that once, only have half day, don't want to wait more than 30 min max or less per ride and no money constrains then I highly recommend to buy the pass, it will be a big difference and your kids and wife will appreciate, I know that some people say that the single rider option brings you similar advantages but I'm today here and there are really not too many rides with this option so pass is ahead of this, of course will be extra money but again, family will appreciate-Even now still with doubt, don't worry I saw that some vendors are selling the pass inside at same cost 70SD, so you can evaluate once inside, I saw that the vendor in front of the Canopy Flyer had some-Food, yes overpriced vs street but normal for this kind of places, so no sorprises here, anyway plan to bring snacks to munch between meals and then have lumh or dinner at some locationHope this helps, nice vacations!

review_334723786,“If you've experienced another universal studios - put your money on something else”,"If you've ever visited any given universal studios berfore and aren't accompanied by kids, this one isn't worth the high entrance price. For thrillerseekers you've got 3 attractions and if you're in it for 4D movies you have 2 of those attractions. It's kinda small, you would do the park in 5-6 hrs (still; I don't speak for those with kids). To get to Sentosa you could take Sentosa express, but I wouldn't. For those of us with good legs it's a 10 min to walk the boardwalk which lies nicely along the water. It's 1$ instead of 4$ with Sentosa express (which is also very crowded sometimes with up to 1 hrs waiting in line)Also! BUY YOUR ENTRANCE TICKETS BEFORE REACHING USS. There are several places to do it. I bought mine in a ticket booth on the boardwalk and I'm glad I did. It was only one in front of me, compared to a massive long queue at USS entrance :-)Transformers attraction is the best attraction, don't miss out of it.If you're traveling alone or are in a company who wouldn't mind splitting up, you can save some time standing in singel riders queue. Instead of queueing 80min it took me 15 for Jurassic rafting for example. You do need to ask the staff at the entrance of the attraction to let you in.Anyways. I spent some good hrs in the park. The shows were the best! Enjoy your visit.

review_334694378,“An amazing day long activity ”,"Universal Studios Singapore is a great replica of the original in Los Angeles, with the convenience of just a few hours flight away from majority of the world, unlike the 16 hours+ long flights one has to take to get to USA.We went on a Tuesday and being holiday season, there was a big rush. It is all but natural for people to begin the day from Madagascar and go in an anti clock wise in zones. That's possibly the reason all rides have long waiting queues. I bought the universal express ticket that was more expensive than the main ticket at Sgd 70 but it was worth it. Worth it because it was very warm and humid and if you have kids and short on time and temper then the express ticket is a must. The Madagascar and Far Far Away are excellent for small kids. Afterwards it's a drag for them but all in all its a very good theme park. You can easily and efficiently do your park in one day. We also saw the all stars Santa Christmas show at 7.20 pm. It was quite good. All in all, it is for sure an excellent venue to spend your time with the family. Keep extra clothes with you if you have kids.

review_334547321,"“Amazing experience, great fun, but insanely crowded”","Great holiday spot for families, couples and groups of friends. They have attractions to cater for all ages and it promises hours of entertainment.Pros:-- wide selection of rides, attractions, events to cater for all types of visitors- great showmanship by the actors and good service from the staffCons:-- expect overpriced F&B- Not many places for parents with young children and seniors to rest when tired (seating benches were few and it can be quite humid given the climate)- crowd on weekends and holidays can be of epic proportionsI came to check out the Halloween horror night event because I have heard so much about it year on year. I was not disappointed the least bit. It was great fun, and the staff handled the crazy sized crowd professionally.Just be mindful that on special occasions and weekends, the crowd is tremendous and getting on to rides may require you to queue for 30 minutes to 2 hours per ride. If you are coming for the rides, you may want to invest in an express pass to let you cut the queue a little. To give you an idea of what I mean, during my visit, the queue to the haunted house was estimated to be 200 minutes long. The express pass I had put me in the priority queue which was only 20 minutes long. While some may shy away from the cost of the express pass, given the temperature and climate of Singapore in general, I am not keen to wait in hours in a crowd of people.You may also want to bring a spare change of tee shirts to slip into after your visit.After all that has been said and done, I can't wait for next year's Halloween event to see what they cook up next!

review_334529002,“Best to come mid-week”,"The crowd here over the weekend can be crazy. The wait for rides can be anywhere between 40-90 minutes! If you're not too fussed about splitting up from your group when on the rides, you can opt for the single rider queue, which is a LOT faster. What happens is you get slotted into single seats to ensure the ride is full. This way, you get to enjoy the ride a lot faster without having to sweat it out in the long queue. They do sell tickets for priority queuing (single ride or unlimited), but these are quite pricey. Best time to come here would be on a Tuesday or Wednesday. Some of the notable rides are Transformers, Puss in Boots and The Mummy. Of course there’s the Battlestar Gallactica ride, but it looked way too scary (but was a crowd favourite, based on the average 80 minutes waiting time). This is a great place to come to with family and friends. Best to arrive here at 10am when the park opens and make a full day of it.

review_334401366,“Not a place to visit if you have toddlers not able to sit by him or herself”,"We visited this place on a Sunday in Dec 2015. The place was packed with people, average waiting time for most of the exciting rides were 40 to 60 mins long. Not wanting to wait so long as we have young kids, we purchased the express ticket at $50 each. This is in addition to the admission ticket of $74 per adult. The express ticket is good for all rides except two: treasure hunters and canopy flyer. We brought two kids, age 3.5 years and 16 months. The little one gets scared easily so she would not leave my lap. Hence she is termed a hand-held infant and does not qualify for all the rides at universal studios except the carousel located at madagascar. Yes, all the rides refused her because she will not sit by herself, including the mini ferris wheel aka ""magic potion spin"" located inside a gift shop. So for the entire trip, I was babysitting my ""hand-held infant"" because of the reason stated above. Not a lot of fun since it was so hot in the sun, and there were indoor seating provided. Would not recommend USS to families with kids under 2 years old.

review_334350482,“Fraking Great day”,"Universal is located in Sentosa which is where most of the leisure parks including the beach, can be found. Getting here from Marina bay was easy using a taxi which costs under SGD20. Generally taxis are quite a good way to go around Singapore if travelling long distances with a group. The star of the rides is Battlestar Galactica with two choices as human or Cylon. Personally I preferred Cylon which had more complicated turns, a loop and also going through some mist. With Cylon your legs are dangling while you rest your feet on the Human. We paid extra a for the express so had one token for each ride. I would say the extra for express is worth it as we cut out the long que's that would have added an extra 30 minutes.Other rides included the Jurasic world which included a water ride which will drench you, a tree top ride that was a bit too slow, the dragon airline at the shrek area which was great fun, the mummy's revenge which was mostly in the dark but was exilerating, a special effects show which was good for anyone in a wheelchair, a transformers ride which is a 3D show which was OK. One ride that was very dull was the Madagascar water ride.. It did not seem to reflect the song.. ""I like to move it""Rides that are NOT present are Indiana Jones and Back to the future which is a real shame. This would have been awesome for the adults.There are regular shows at the different areas with live performers dressed up to entertain. Kids will be particularly amused by the shows and rides.The food stalls were a standard affair of burgers, fish and chips and wraps.

review_333950823,“Fun!”,"Went on a weekday and very crowded. Fortunately it was December and park closed at 9pm instead of the usual 6pm. The longest wait was 60min for the cyclone rollercoaster. The rest varied between 30-45min, with some kid rides just a 5min wait. The transformer ride is a must do. Suggest to do it upon entering the park, followed by the rollercoasters. Then do the rest according to your preference. Kids get tired by half day, remember to bring a stroller, or rent one from the park.

review_333934794,“Well worth a visit”,"Definitely worth a visit with lots to do. Strongly recommend going early so that you can get around the park. The park was a standout offering some of the rides and attractions slightly different to other parks (I had the good fortune of visiting UStudio in LA). Whilst there were similar attractions, you could not help but feel a sense of wonder. Highlights for my group were the Minions Store, Madagascar rides and also the BattleStar Ride. A theme park is a theme park so be prepared to spend up on everything including food!

review_333865057,“A Definite Place To Go If You Are In Singapore!”,"You must visit this attraction if you are in Singapore. Many interesting rides for all ages. The good thing about the attraction is that they have a balanced range of indoor and outdoor rides. Hence, if it rains, you could still enjoy some of the indoor rides there. Visitors should plan their route before visiting this attraction to maximise their time here. If it rains, you can always go to the indoor rides like the Transformers Ride, Sesame Street Ride or experience the musical performance at one of the theatres there. They are currently playing a Sesame Street Christmas musical. I would really recommend that visitors do their research and find out the timing for street performances and appearances made by the USS characters like Beetlejuice, Minions, Madagascar and Sesame Street characters, etc. It's an opportune time to really get close and take a photo with the characters. Variety of halal food in various interestingly-themed restaurants. Food is tasty but like many similar attractions, could be quite pricey for budget travellers. There's a comfortable prayer room for those planning to spend the whole day at USS. It's near to the Egyptian-themed attraction. Just one suggestion to make about the staff in USS. Although they may be quite efficient and professional, I think it would be great if they could exhibit more warmth and cheerfulness when interacting with visitors there. We've been to themed parks overseas like Korea, Japan & Hong Kong where we saw more smiles on their faces and really getting into the spirit of a theme park. Nevertheless, that did not dampen our enthusiasm experiencing the rides and atmosphere in USS.

review_333719314,“Among the list to explore in Singapore this was on the top.”,"On the top of list. Why? Because, the most expensive attraction on sentosa is an amusement park!! This notion always bugs me as in my opinion amusement parks are a place for kids and teens. There is nothing much for an young adult to do there other than to supervise them. Also, I am a nature lover and love to walk trails and climb up the highlands or, dive into the Sea etc. so an amusement park doesn't spark the bomb of adventure as to explore any such activity.However, Since many of my friends having already visited and telling me good about the place, I chose to visit it with my better half to spend some leisure time.I reached the venue late and started even late but in a pattern suggested by my colleague and on his suggestion to not to miss any of the rides and to cover them first.I started from Sci-Fi zone, heading towards the most hyped 'Transformers Evac Ride'. I respect the movies series but after being told that waiting time for ride is 1 Hour or more. The only thing I cursed was the popularity of the movies which I supposed was the reason behind so much wait. I kept the expectations grounded and started to test my patience after exact 1 hour and 10 minutes we were in-front to ride on the Evac. Everything seem mysterious as along the whole wait time visitors are addressed as recruits of NEST team and are briefed about a mission which seems to be similar to the incident when all spark has been attempted to burgled by 'decepticons' and mission objective is to foil this attempt.& then... the ride finally started to unveil what is there to feel. You are put in the mid of the situation with Evac to witness the near real 4D fight scenes. It was like a rugby match on going between Autobots and Decepticons with ball being the All spark. I felt it very much exciting because I didn't expected something like this. At the end of ride I made a decision to visit USS again not for any other ride but for Transformers.We then headed towards Battlestar Galactica 'Human' as my wife rejected going to 'Cylon'. The rollercoaster is nice but here also I had to wait for almost less than an hour to get the chance and I was continuously p****ed off by excessive shouting by some lady commander while trying in vain to fill fear in riders. IMO, this was nothing compared to the excitement filled in by transformer ride.We headed to Mummy's ride, which was damn dark but was better than Galactica Human (next time i'll go on Cylon to see if that is better)Then we covered Jurassic world to end our time of visit. The little rides remaining were not worth my explaining here.Please take this writeup as my personal opinion.Good Luck with your visit.

review_333600240,“Loved it!!”,"Visited USS in November with our 2 young children (6yrs & 2yrs), and had an amazing time. Purchased the express passes which were worth it. No longer than 5mins wait for rides which is a huge deal when traveling with kids, most lines were 30-45mins wait time. The weather was rainy when we went but it didn't negatively affect our time, we bought some cheap ponchos which solved the problem and didn't affect any of the rides. We started off in the Madagascar area and were all able to go on the river ride, both of our boys loved it, we ended up doing it a few times. Our 6yr old was able to go on all rides apart from the Battlestar Galactica rides, I took him on the Mummy ride and apart from his initial apprehension he ended up loving it (this ride is my favourite), he also loved the Jurassic Park Rapids ride and Tranformers Rides. Our 2yr old is quite little and wasn't able to go on many rides apart from the Madagascar river ride, Madagascar carousel and the Treasure Hunters Car ride, but there was enough happening to keep him visually entertained. Even with our express passes meaning we didn't have to wait for any lines we still managed to spend from opening to close at USS, that was without doing any of the movie style shows such as shreks 4-d adventure or the Donkey Live show. All in all it was a fantastic day and we ended up going back to Sentosa for a second day to do Adventure Cove and the luge etc.

The best being transformers, followed by Jurassic park rapids the and the mummy ride.. . We went with my 2.5 years old daughter who jus managed to cross the minimum height requirements.. She also had a great time.. One piece of suggestion, if u are going with a child who can't do all rides , then go through the 'single rider' line instead of taking express pass( which is pricey).. Cos at most of the times there is a waiting even at the express line, but single rider lines is super duper fast.. The main 3 rides above I did with single rider and managed to complete it within max half n hour..

There was a long line and the whole place was super crowded. But then we came to know that if you're visiting universal studios during Christmas time then go at 5 pm because the ticket price is half (48SD) and there's not more than 10 minutes waiting time for the rides. So we spent 10 am to 4 pm on the beaches and at 5 pm when we reached universal studios to our surprise there were not more than five people in the line and there was so less of the waiting time that we did some of the rides twice. So I would recommend go at 5 pm and enjoy less crowd and good weather.

review_333450447,“Lots of fun filled rides!!”,"On my last visit to Singapore i had been to Sentosa island.. but this was way more fun and totally worth.There are numerous rides and a day may not be enough to cover it all, so you have to come as early as possible and select the rides and then just go for it.The only problem is the huge queues at every ride, especially the good ones. But there are drinking water points along most queues and you can eat while waiting to reduce time waste. If you are looking for some serious fun! better to head straight to the Transformer section, which has a super cool ride, near that there will be the huge blue roller coaster rides. If you like to experience 4D movie, try the Shrek one.Also there is super fun and thrilling ride in the Egypt ..mummies section. MUST TRY!Also there was a water ride initially, it was fun,, but not worth waiting for an hour...So if queues are not bearable for you there is VIP pass sort of thing which is a more expensive ticket with shorter queues, but personally i feel it not that necessary.

review_333053965,“Well worth a visit but beware if they think it will rain!”,"We had a good time here. If I visited Singapore more often or had spent longer there it's well worth going for their annual passBefore going I had read reviews on the rides and watched online videos. Before hitting 40 I was terrified of roller coasters but then started to love them. At the time of visiting I was going through a phase of being scared of them again and so some of the reviews got me a trifle scared.One ride that others had said was scary was 'Revenge of the Mummy'. I entered this with trepidation. However I found that the reviews were wrong and there was nothing at all the be scared about. In fact we rode it several times in a row! It has a roller coaster part but this was tame. The ride is over and done with far too quickly.Because of my fear of roller coasters re emerging I left riding Battlestar Galactia far too late. Yes, it was scary but it was also very fun and given the chance I would ride it again and again. Based on online advice we did the Human ride first. I then plucked up enough courage to go on the Cylon side. We waited in line for around 30 minutes only to be told that the ride was closed. No raintickets were offered or an option to jump the line once it re opened which I felt was very poor practice. I am sure that had this been the USA or Disney some sort of compensation would have been offered. Upon stepping outside we found that it was not raining (there were thunder clouds in the sky) and there was no reason for the ride to shut.When Universal finally realised that the rain was not going to happen, the ride reopened. Fortunately we noticed this and got in the long line again (had we received 'credit' for our long wait previously then we should have gone to the front of the line or in the fast track lane). As the line was long and the park closed at 6pm we were worried that we would again be asked to leave the line and depart. Fortunately Universal allowed us to continue the wait and we did eventually get to ride. As we exited we found that although the park was officially closed and the rides were all closed, shops were still open and many many people were still inside the park. This was at least an hour after official closing. So don't rush to leave even if the official close time has passed!All the rides we went on were fun but the only real thrill ride was Battlestar Galatica. Food is expensive in the park as is merchandise. More in line with US prices than Asian prices. But then Singapore (bar China Town) is not typical of other Asian places and is an expensive place to visit on the whole.One thing that was missing, that is available in both the US Universal parks (which I have visited numerous times) is a backlot tour. This is mainly because it's just a theme park and not a working film studio.All in all a good day. There is a lot to do in Sentosa itself and I would love to have time one day to spend more time there to explore.Worth a visit and fun for all ages. But if roller coasters are your thing then don't be a chicken like I was and ride them early before the lines get busy.

Popular rides like Battlestar Galactica, Transformer etc, the waiting time can be more then an hour wait.Do skip Treasure Hunter unless you have young kids. The waiting time can sometimes be quite long and it is not worth waiting in the ""Q"". You may like to have your dinner at KT Grill in the evening. Look for Daniel the Manager there.

There are also many food options! I would suggest getting there early. We arrived just on opening time and there were already long lines to enter the park. There are lockers available for rental which was a good option for us. The lines for the rides can get pretty long, so head to the main rides first. I would also suggest waiting for maybe a show to start and then head back to any other main rides if you want to avoid long lines.

review_332686992,“A Memorable Family Experience”,"Went to USS with my husband and three sons (12, 7 and 5 years old). Most of the rides were for adults or taller kids but our children did enjoy those that were available for them. The long queues were worth it. Our favorite ride was the wet raft ride at the Jurassic World. The Transformers 3d ride was also exciting (even if we lined up for more than an hour!). If you love extreme rides, i highly recommend Battlestar Galactica! The food served was not as splendid but the kids loved their hotdogs, fries and nuggets. The turkey leg served was dry. Not much fab dining choices inside the park. It was our family bonding time so we tried not to mind the staff (facilitating the queues and operating the rides) who never smiled and were very stiff. This is the reason why I am only rating them 4 despite the impressive facilities.Bringing extra shirts (especially for kids) would help. An empty / handy refillable bottled water container would also be great since there are lots of cold and potable water / drinking fountains all over the amusement park. Mint candies came in handy for me and were very helpful after my extreme roller coaster ride! There are quick lines for 'one person' in some rides like The Mummy which you might want to take advantage of. Overall, it was a memorable and lovely bonding experience for us.

review_332686025,“Small but fun!”,"Universal studios Singapore might be small but definitely has exciting attractions! Best for active teenages and adults, there will also be rides for children too! You have to try their churros there, it's freshly baked right from the oven! If you feel hungry or thirsty, there are many food stalls along the way so you won't have to walk much back to their restaurant! USS is very clean too!

review_332575248,“Good experience for movie lovers”,"First, purchase the ticket online to enjoy some privilege such as free meal voucher and avoid the queue at the ticketing counter. Second, the park would change its parade and activities based on the festival. I was disappointed because the parade has cancelled due to Christmas festival but the specially made events were not great enough to wow visitors. The firework only available during weekend. The facilities are good but some rides are incredibly short. If you are not quite a patient person, it's advisable to purchase Express ticket. Good point is that the line-up area is equipped with big fan to cool the visitors. Transformer is definitely the highlight of the park (you can see from the length of the queue). Tip to play without much waiting is to visit an hour before the park closes. If you are lucky enough, you could take the ride immediately without waiting. (Do buffer more time in case the day of your visit is peak season). Playing in the theme park in Tropical country is exhausting. If you need a lot of drinking water, you may consider to buy their water bottle from $10 up with $2 each refill.

But a friend told me that he bought tickets for S$60 in china town. You can go on all the rides as many times as you like with one ticket. There are 3 ways to enter the island. 1. Cable car @S$252. Train @ S$ 53. 20 minute walk free of charge.The gates open at 10.00am and close at 6.00pm. Sometimes there is a queue for the rides. The waiting time for each is displayed outside each ride.

The park was closed earlier in October to give way for special Halloween-themed rides and ghost house events happening all month which we missed because we were not aware until we got there.

The moment you enter and get yourself clicked on the back drop of much loved Universal Studio Globe. They keep your camera ready to click pictures of so many interesting / innovative things on your way to the Studios. If you have less time than buy a pass for all rides. All the simulations, games Some of the Highlights:-1) Cyclone Roller Coaster :- Best roller coaster. I was little scared initially but so not to be missed.2) Transformer Ride :- I took 3 rides. One of my fav. 3) water world theme show :- this is superb. There are some surprise tricks which makes it more interesting 4) Mummy revenge :- WOW! This is for the strong hearts. I would not recommend for young kids :) 5) Jurassic world :- so much fun, Get ready to for some splashes and Dino tricks on you.6) Street Dances :- you will not get bored while walking around the Studio because there are so many activities which could be a nice photo op moments.

review_331727635,“Things can be improved for the image of Singapore”,"This is my 4th time here. Buying online tickets is a must as when I reached the place at about 12pm, the ticket queue was pretty long. But as I was using some bank vouchers I could only get the tickets onsite. Snacks are not allowed in the park. As it was the Christmas period, the whole place was decked with very nice Xmas decorations. I think the rides are too short especially if you have to queue for about 40 mins to get your turn. The people manning the rides can also have more smiles as they look really grouchy and the way they give instructions is quite rude. Not very good impression of Singapore if you are a tourist here. Yes I have to highlight that the weather is hot but this is a ""fun"" attraction so people are here to have fun! Food is quite expensive here as to all theme parks everywhere. We had a break at the diner near the stage area. The Double double burger is just not edible. You can charge sky-high price but your food needs to be edible. It cost S$20 for a burger, small fries, a coke and a small Milo. Other than that, it is a fun place for kids less than 14 years old. Very few rides for younger kids.

review_331724606,“Small but Fun! Skip the VIP Tour”,"We took the VIP tour this past November. The park is smaller than other Universal Parks, but has a fun ""sequel"" feel, as all of the sections of the park feel like extensions of their parent parks (""Jurassic Park"" becomes ""The Lost World"", etc.). Highlight is definitely the Battlestar Galactica duelling rollercoasters, which is similar to Duelling Dragons in Florida, except one train (Cylon) is head-over-heels inverted coaster while the other (Human) is a standard coaster offering a fast & smooth ride. VIP Tour was nice, but not really worth the money for anyone well-versed in theme parks, so instead I would recommend just the Express Pass.

review_331715070,“The joys of Universal Express!”,"We are a family of four with a 7 yr old girl and a 4 yr old boy. We had a 2 day stop over in Singapore en route to Phuket and decided to do the Universal Studios day trip. It was an absolute thrill. We arrived at around 10 on a Monday and were in the park 20 mins later. It was quite busy as it was school holidays. Having 2 little kids and with only a limited amount of time, we bought the universal express multiple pass. This essentially doubles the entry price per person but it was so worth it. When you see a queue for a ride and breeze pass to the front, you'll be thinking you're glad you worked harder for the privilege! If you do the multiple - around S$70 in addition to the park entry of S$74 - you can skip the queue for the same ride multiple times. We rode the puss in boots giants journey about 10 times, the enchanted airways about 7 times and the battlestar gallactica about 4 times. Would never have been able to do that without the universal express pass. Lunch was a bit tough but we opted for some pizza at Louis's in New York. Yummy! Snacks are available throughout the park (popcorn, churro, turkey legs, ice cream ( Ben and Jerry's) and there is a chillis outside the park for dinner. Regarding the attractions - there are 7 worlds . Kids will love far far away (shrek), Madagascar, Jurassic park and sci-fi city.The mummy's revenge is a cool roller coaster in the dark . Don't bother with the treasure hunters ride in ancient Egypt . It was epically boring!Some tips -Shell out the extra for the universal express multiple pass.Ride the Cylon ride as opposed to the human ride. More exciting especially the mist part.Do the Jurassic park rapid rivers early in order to dry out during the day. Taxis are available in the basement of the park at the casino entrance to take you back to the hotels.

review_331580083,“A must visit in Sentosa”,"We went on a Thursday, it was not crowded as the weekends but there was a long queue for the Gattlestar Galactica and the Transformers ride. Better to take an express pass if you are visiting in a weekend otherwise you will have to wait in the long queues, or if possible try to go there in a week day. The rides are amazing, you can have some thrilling experience with Gattlestar Galactica, Transformers ride and the Revenge of the Mummy ride. Tip: you can't take your bags & stuff when you are going for some roller costars. They have lockers available near those places but they are free for about 1 hour. if it takes more that one hour you need to pay for the lockers to open them, so make sure you take some cash (notes) in your pockets if you are planning to put your wallets in the locker because for some rides it usually takes more that 1 hour due to the queue. There is a display near some rides which shows the waiting time. Also note that the lockers won't return you the balance so don't put big notes there, you can get them changed in nearby shops or from the locker supervisors.

review_331265852,“A whole new world.”,"USS is like the ultimate fantasy world for people of all ages. Rides- thrilling for adults and fun for children. My two favourites are Cylon(the blue one) and Mummy revenge. Oh and at Jurrasic world, it's probable that you'll get wet. So it's a good idea to take a raincoat or a thin plastic sheet- anything to cover up. But of cos it's ok if you dont mind getting wet. After all, travelling in singapore needs an umbrella 'cos.... u know... the infamous Singapore weather. Online ticketing is recommended as it eases up on ur budget. For the speedy rides, you'll need to use the lockers to put your things in. They're free for the first 45 minutes, the machine will charge you if it's over 45 minutes. So you'd better avoid weekends when you'll get stucked in those never-ending long queue. It's gonna be the whole day so take something to eat and water..You know how things are at a theme park- so pricey. I didnt even take photos with those cartoon mascots. I was just eager to go to the rides and yes partly because of the queue. So rides- first... photo - later.

My kids took advantage of the (fast pass whick you pay a little extra for that i dont mind) to go repeatedly the rides that they wanted to. For a theme park they have very good food outlets. Not as complete as the ones in the USA but certainly it didnt feel like its lacking. Easily to get there from the city and beside it is the big SG aquarium so it makes it worth your while cause its hitting two parks all at once. Only downside is its really hot in SG so its really hot in there. I love also that its connected to resorts world so theres plenty of shopping and very good food outlets.

Transformers was a great ride but my 4 year old didn't think so. She also missed out on the Jurassic Park ride as she was maybe a centimetre too short.

review_330924570,“Very impressive but long queues”,"This was my second visit to Universal Studios. I am not a huge fan of theme parks, however, one of the kids was very keen on a return visit to ride the roller coasters.The park is located on Sentosa Island and is truly impressive, from the Universal Studios Globe at the park entrance to the incredible attention to detail in which the park's themed areas have been set up. Two stand outs for me are ""Ancient Egypt"", which is so grand & realistic that you can actually imagine being there during that period, and the imposing ship from the Madagascar movie. ""Far Far Away"" (Shrek), ""Hollywood"" & ""New York"" are also very impressive. As mentioned, the park is divided into different themed areas and caters for all age groups. There are two absolutely crazy outdoor roller coasters, one with a traditional carriage set up and the other where you are suspended beneath the track. There is also an indoor roller coaster in Ancient Egypt, which is in complete darkness.The grounds are immaculately maintained and the park is extremely well run & organised.We attended the live Water World show which was fantastic with special effects & stunts involving jet skis & boats - definitely worth attending if visiting the park.Unfortunately there are are long queues, with ""wait times"" of up to 180 minutes, for most rides. Wait times are clearly advertised at the entrance to each ride which is great as it provides advanced warning, although I do not believe they are very accurate - maybe a little underestimated? Excessive wait times are what I believe lets the park down. Firstly, who wants to queue for 180 minutes or more to get on a ride? In my opinion, this is an unrealistic expectation. The issue is further compounded when you are visiting with a family of children of different age groups, who have different interests and ride restrictions. For my family, the excessive wait times led to the situation where our family had to split up & go off in different directions - not what we wanted to do on a family holiday. The alternative was for the entire family to wait around for at least 180 minutes for one child to go on a ride - also not a desirable prospect.Universal Studios is definitely worth a visit, even if you are not a huge fan of theme parks & despite the excessive wait times.

Food and drink inside the park will cost you extra. The rides not to miss are ""revenge of the mummy"" and ""transformers""... The category5 hurricane reconstruction , voiceover by Steven speilberg is worth a watch. Madagascar and Shrek 4D , jurassic age and character meets were a hit with d kids. This is a must see according to me.

review_330443809,“Universal Studios - Value for Money ?????”,"Recently we visited Universal Studio Singapore with family with great expectations in mind. Arrived early as well as a non peak day no holiday. As the studio really is a great place to enjoy with family, however if you are planning for the rides, please think twice. We wanted to try the Transformers ride, Roller coaster all had a waiting time of 2 hrs minimum if you want all to sit together. We stood in the Q for the transformer ride & literally for 1 hr it just moved slowly & gave up. So by 11.30 am we were already tired & stressed out waiting in long Q's - just waiting & moving around, this continued for all the rides. So at the end of the day ( they close all rides around 6 pm ) all that we could see was the studio, its worth watching - really beautiful. However my kid wanted to enjoy the rides, which were ???? The food etc inside comes at a price. However if you have an express pass ticket then you can jump the Q , but you pay extra for the express pass as well. So at the end of the day if you have bought a regular ticket - not sure its value for money ????

review_330438858,“Bit of a let down”,"Mixed feelings. Some great rides but not enough to really occupy adults for the full day.The two main rides (Battlestar Galactica) broke down regularly during the day and we never got to ride them. After paying for entry fee and express tickets we felt a bit ripped off that we couldn't experience to two most exciting rides. We complained to the office and got lied to essentially. Told the rides were working when they weren't.Glad we had the express tickets though as the queues looked huge, even for a Friday.The staff were young, unhelpful and totally disinterested. If we had of got to ride the two big rollercoasters a couple of times we would have felt better about the day.

review_329898845,“An exciting outing with family - choose a weekday”,"Universal Studios will require your entire day even though it is in the Sentosa Island. So do not think of clubbing this with other Sentosa attractions. Make sure you choose a weekday. If you have no option but the weekend, it would make sense to shell out an extra 50 SGD per head to avail the express entry on a crowded day as waiting times can tend to be in hours. Therefore avoid weekends. The park attractions are categorized into 7 zones. The best rides to begin with would be Transformers, Revenge of the Mummy, Shrek 4D, Jurassic Park rapid adventure, Battlestar Galactica. Make sure you plan them. The lights, camera, action show was disappointing. Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase is good for kids below 5. Water refills available at places. Food courts are spread across the park. Overall an exciting day spent. Carry some shades, might get hot on a sunny day.

review_329837939,“Tips for Universal Studio”,"Some useful tips for universal studio which might be enjoyable for you:1.Choose the weekdays not public holiday. If you choose weekend (Saturday & Sunday) long queue will be there which will be painful. Better you should buy a express entry ticket for weekend. 2.Take light raincoat, light snacks in one bag. Don’t fill your bag with unnecessary things as you have to walk the whole day.3. Wear comfortable attire i.e. shorts and t-shirt and comfortable keds4. Reach there as early as possible. It opens at 10 am. Ask for free shuttle service (Valid for Concorde Hotel, Mandarin Orchard, Grand Hyatt, Shngri-La, Orchard Hotel) from your hotel. Or from anywhere straight go to vivo city and take the entry ticket from there. If you are the user of Singapore Airlines then you will get the discount for ticket.5. Don't forget to take the map from vivo city or entrance of the USS.6. As there will be less queue in the morning, so don't waste your time and as much as you can use your time for ride only Don't eat, don't take picture etc. You will get the time after riding.7. In some rides you have to put your backpack in lockers which are available near the ride. Lockers are free for first 30 minutes.8. First, without wasting time, catch “the transformers ride” which is located at sci-fi city.9. After that directly go to Ancient Egypt for “revenge of the mummy” ride which is indoor roller coaster. Here you have to put your backpack in locker.10. Now head for The Lost World to enjoy “Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure ride”. In this ride, you might get wet. So wear your raincoat before entering. If you don’t have one, you can buy one from there. You will find the raincoat before entering or a vending machine will be there which will cost SGD 4.11. After that you can go for the “Battlestar Galactica”. This is a outdoor roller coaster which has two tracks, Cylon (blue track) and Human (red track). Cylon is more adventurous than Human. Here you have to put your backpack in locker. Remember to empty your pocket.So many street performance will be there for enjoying.12. Other attractions you should not miss are: Shrek 4-D, Madagascar: a crate adventure (For children under 12), Light Camera Action, “Water World” show.You can always plan your day according to your preferences and queue timings. You should ask the queue time before entering to attraction, so you can utilize your time more efficiently.13. Also pay attention to “Character Meet and Greet” timings. You don’t want to miss chance to click a snap with movie characters you like.14. You can buy universal express pass to skip regular queue. But I would not recommend it because you can easily complete all the attractions in one day with proper planning. But for weekend it might be helpful.15. After finishing the main attraction you can spare time for your photo session. In evening there is different atmosphere with decorative lights. Spare some time in evening also.16. I recommend enjoying attractions you like for second time rather than wasting your time in attractions which are not worth i.e. beach party go round, treasure hunters. You can also skip Monster Rock show.17. Also you can find a crane dance at 9 PM just 5-10 minutes away from USS you shouldn't miss it which is absolutely free for everyone.

You can try all the games you want, with a little time to queue. No need to buy universal express when you go at weekdays.Don't forget to bring your umbrella/disposable raincoat if you go there at rainy season.Don't forget to take the schedule show to know what you want to see, and what time. I would recommend, Water World show to have a fun experience. That attraction was so cool! Try the ""soak zone"" if you don't mind to get wet.Also, you can find many food and drinks and also snacks there. And if you want to buy some souvenirs with ""Universal Studio"" labelled or one of the characters there, just go to the store (but that a little bit pricey).

Got the Universal express pass for use once on each ride and thought it was excellent, however I will warn that appearantely the price changes based on the popularity of it on any given day. We looked online before going and it advertised as $30 and when we got there we were charged $50, so I think that is a bit rude.

review_329492369,“A good place to enjoy the whole day but try to come early on weekends”,"We travelled to Universal studios as a couple on board of a tour package to SG in November. While it was an optional item on the trip, we decided to go ourselves on what happened to be a Sunday. First up, you can get cheaper Universal studio tickets from travel agents than at the door so do try and see if thats possible. Secondly there are various packages online in which USS may be part of an attraction package combined with other Sentosa activities so you may want to see you can save their or not. Secondly if you're going on a weekend i'd advice reaching their early and going to the more popular rides perhaps - such as the Revenge of the mummy or the Transformers roller coaster as they tend to have higher waiting times during the day. One thing which is really cheap of these guys is something called Express pass which allows people to get into rides instantly instead of through the queues for a higher entry price. Having two sets of lines for entry is something medieval and having this in a beautiful modern city like SG is poor taste. Anyways in terms of the rides the Lost world ride, the Waterworld experience (which has specific timings only so keep that in mind), the transformer rides or the Jurassic Park one are good. Another crafty trick by them to make money is use of locker for rides at 4$ for 20 mins (after a small complimentary time) to keep your stuff so ensure you don't carry bags, purses etc. unless you really need them there, Apart from the rides we had fun with the photo ops and the small entertainment shows at every section of USS . All in all good fun and enough to occupy almost a full day till evening on a weekend due to the crowds.

review_329312594,“Best time ever! ”,"Just go for the Battlestar Galactica ride. Its one of the best rides ever! The new 2 seater ride was way more exciting than the previous 4 seater. The new puss in boots right had technical difficulties while i was there and it took a good 20mins to be resolved. Nevertheless it was an exciting ride. The longest wait for a single attraction was the transformers. Would recomend anyone to take the rides that would need to queue the longest first as most of the other rides are shorter and they will not take more than 30mins to queue on a weekday.

review_329276735,“Thrill & fun filled day”,"Our sole purpose of going to Singapore was to spend a day at USS. It was raining on the day we arrived but thank goodness it was bright and sunning day the next day. We went on Wednesday to avoid the weekend crush and it was a good decision. The waiting period at most of the rides were between 5 - 15 mins. But by mid afternoon the waiting period of the popular rides were up to 45mins. My suggestions is to for the popular rides in the morning and purchase the Express pass if you want to go for anther rides later. For those who shy away from the adrenaline rush like me, there the indoor games and 5D shows to enjoy.One of the ride - The Jurassic Park you need to wear raincoat/poncho so its good to bring your own or your can buy them at SD4.00.However please be prepared to do a lot of walkings and hot sun so drink plenty of water. Please watch out for the Waterwork show - it was brilliant and not to be missed.Will definitely come again as our 2 teens really enjoyed the theme park.

review_329224986,“Worth a day's activities”,"-:- I being a regular and frequent visitor to USS will mean I don't experience the kind of things you can experience situationally as a first-time visitor/guest to the park. Events such as a heavy downpour which leads to hours and hours of suspension of outdoor attractions, or technical faults with certain machines, etc. -:-I recall clearly that 4 years back my first visit to USS was fun and filled my entire day. I visited there alone and was very timid at that time, and went on most rides before wrapping up the day. I did not have major issues with the park, but I did note that the prices on almost everything (F&B, Retail, etc) were almost exorbitant. There were certain long queues at the hit attractions such BSG:HvsC, RoTM and CF.Generally to this day, the regular problems still stay, such as long queues, bad weather during certain months, etc. Queues are not something they can manage on their end, other than effective crowd control. There is only so many people at once they can admit to each attraction/ride/rollercoaster/location/etc at once, and you have to consider human delays such as when loading and unloading guests.I recommend getting a Universal Express Pass if you know you will be there for the whole day or when you won't have enough time to wait out all the queues if you're visiting other parks or other places on Sentosa. It's best to get a Universal Express Pass early in the day as the prices are cheaper (~S$50++). The more passes they sell, the more expensive they get. This is to reduce the number of express guests so that there will not be an equally long queue for express as with the regular queue.I am now an annual pass holder with unlimited Universal Express and I am practically ""immune"" to all the rides and attractions, so I really cannot comment much on how my experience is on the rides. I can only advise to visit all the attractions at least twice each, just in case there are faulty systems and you may have missed some parts without realising it.Cheers

review_329186701,“Awesome place ...”,"Have listen a lot about universal studios singapore and it's really true by all means. In fact each place & each ride gives u amazing feeling. The most liked and never missed rides are transformers, mummy and roller coaster.Don't miss the water world - it's really amazing to see live performance in front of your eyes. The Steven Spielberg show is also worth to watch.It's not so big like Florida and hence would get enough time to cover all rides in one day. Having said that if u are fond of rides & want to cover all rides with more than one time would recommend to go for express ticket.It's really worth it & will give u opportunity to go for most favourite rides back to back.All major rides are having free locker facilities & hence u can carry your personal belongings along with u inside, however food items are not permitted inside.Enjoy your day....

review_328941730,“Incredible rides and experiences for anyone.”,"To begin, let's get one thing clear: you will never be able to ride all of the rides in one day (unless maybe if you have a skip-line pass) so plan out on the map early which ones are your priority rides. The park is a MUST when you're in Sentosa! It's probably the best way to spend a full day with friends or family, as the attractions inside cater to everyone. I also like how we're allowed to bring our own water bottles and snacks inside the park (unlike many amusement parks), and this isn't a bad idea for anyone looking to save a bit of money while in Singapore.The rides we managed to do in 7 hours in the park were Battlestar Galactica (Human), Revenge of the Mummy, Jurassic Park Rapids, Transformers 4D, and Battlestar Galactica (Cylon). The wait times are worst before and right after lunch (at least one hour), and best about 1700H (averaging 30 minutes). I highly recommend the Mummy and the Cylon rides, for sheer adrenaline rush (and makes the SGD 74.00 entrance fee so worth it), and the Transformers 4D for sheer coolness. BONUS: As of writing, using a MasterCard credit card gets you SGD 10.00 off the entrance fee per ticket, so swipe away!NOTES: Bring lots of loose change for locker rentals (about SGD 2.00 - 4.00), and a light waterproof parka for the random drizzle.

review_328894885,“Save your money for something else that IS fun..”,"My Wife and I visited Universal studios in October of this year and were pretty disappointed. For starters, the place is pretty small with a lot less to do than other Universal Studios we have visited previously. I will admit that if you were taking kids it would be ok, but that being said there isnt a whole lot for them either. The main attractions are limited to three or four bigger rides, and the rest is based around the usual ""themed"" streets and restaurants designed to fleece you of your hard earned. The locker system with fingerprint locks designed for storing your items whilst riding is seriously flawed as well, meaning they just dont open again. The resultant wait for an attendant to assist coupled with the crowds and the heat was a great motivator to leave a lot earlier than anticipated. All in all we felt a bit ripped off and would have asked for a refund if we hadnt pre-booked online. The only shining light of this place is the hawkers market just outside the entrance- great food at reasonable prices and just managed to make the trip to Sentosa worthwhile!

review_328617199,“Endless excitement”,"Once you plan to visit USS, (Universal Studios Singapore) you have to : 1) start early. 11 am is their opening time2) wear comfortable shoes 3) bring water bottle. 4) bring an umbrella, sunnies, and wear sunblock. 5) camera, and extra batteries. The park is huge, you cant visit all the attractions in one whole day. The street shows has timings and you have to catch Shrek, Fiona, Madagascar animals, Betty boop, minions, and a whole lot more - along the way. The rides are amazing especially the transformers, i so love it! Dont miss the mummy ride! Lockers can be rented. But you can bring a body bag for some rides. The galactica is open again, and human or cyclone option is available. Both runs for less than a minite, but swear, its the longest one minute i ever had! Theater shows are there to catch too! There are restaurants inside and the price isnt so cheap. Numerous souvenir shops are around the corner so you wont miss buying an item for yourself or loved ones. One great tip. Instead of using the colorful MOnorail going to sentosa island (most people go to harbourfront and ride the train there - its 3$) , you can take the RWS bus outside vivo city. Upon alighting purple lane's harbourfront, go up to the mall and look for the shops - Coach, Armani, near the activity area. There's bread talk restaurant at the corner, go outside and walk to the bus stop. You can see RWS bus queue. This only cost 2$. Going back to Harbourfront in the evening, you can use the monorail - its free.

Apart from the must do roller coasters, Transformers and Mummies are other must do rides. There are also a lot of shows and 3-D movies which can be enjoyed by all, and especially those who cant do rides. The must watch show is Water World which is live action-movie and is an amazing experience. The only negative about Universal Studios is that one can't visit it again and again as nothing much changes here and once you have done the rides, the surprise part is not there anymore.

During our visit, there is a lot of people here and need to wait for 2 hours in order to just ride Human roller coaster. If you have a budget, pleaseeee get your Express Passs so that you can skip the queue and experience all rides in this park. I love all of their performance as it is very enjoyable. Their staff is helpful when we ask them to take picture of us. There is a lot of restaurant in here but for Muslim I advise choosed it wisely as not all restaurant is Halal. (Oasis Spice Cafe in Ancient Egypt and Mel's Diner in New York City is a Halal Restaurant) Average price for meal is SGD 15 per person. Bring your own bottle so that you wouldn't waste your money buying drinks here because it is quite expensive in USS. For me, it is definitely worth visiting!!!! I'll come again for sure!

review_328499997,“A Must do while in Singapore!”,"From the beginning, it was awesome! You can make it through the entire park in one day; the longest wait in line was about 40 minutes (during the week). There was a meet & greet with some of the characters! I was able to get pictures with the Minions and even Beetlejuice, missed Shrek & Fiona. There was also a “New York” neighborhood area, where you could take pictures with wax look a-likes of celebrities, and watch a live performance of the Sesame Street characters. Even if you don’t have kids, you find yourself singing along to the tunes that we all grew up with.Best RidesTransformers, the Ride - was set up for long lines, however if you go during the week, it’s only about a 10 to 20 minute wait, if that. It’s actually a 4D ride, where you ride in a “transformer” with 3D glasses on, and some of the scenes you can literally feel the effects! This ride was so much fun I went back a second time! Jurassic Park rapids adventure – This started out like a lazy river; slow & uneventful, like the movie…until you encounter the dinosaurs! More fun for the kids, until you here an announcement that some of the “attractions” have gotten loose. As you see more dinosaurs, the water gets a little rougher, but fun. Each tube, which carries 8 people, goes inside “the lab”, and right before you are “attacked” by a T-rex, you escape with a splash ending!Tip: Anything you don’t want to get wet, lockers are provided.Water World- great live show, with lots of action & stunts! This adaptation of the movie was very entertaining. The stunt personnel did an awesome job of getting the audience to participate and cheer on the heroes. There were lots of explosions, flames, shootouts and good old fist fighting. The cool thing was that the bleachers were color-coded, for those that wanted to get wet and cool off, to those who wanted to avoid getting wet at all.Worst ridesTreasure Hunter - (Just for the little ones). This one is strictly for the little ones. It’s a very slow ride in a car that you can let one of the kids’ steer (it’s on a track). If you don’t have children under 10, don’t get in the line; the wait in line is longer than the ride itself.Revenge of the Mummy – The outside was very impressive and there were also actors in costume that you could take pictures with. The ride started out slow, with stops along the way to feed you the storyline. However, while I was excited to ride, my excitement was deflated due to this being an indoor coaster that was way too dark to enjoy. Throughout the park, there are numerous shops and restaurants to enjoy a variety of foods and souvenirs. While all parks of this sort are kind of expensive, Universal is totally worth it, and I will definitely go again!

review_328018423,“Excellent day but you MUST get the express pass !”,"I have been to Universal Studios in Singapore before but thought this time around it would be worth writing a review. Earlier this week we were passing through the garden city and thought that a mid week visit to the park was a must do ! The park seemed quite but for a mere S$ 50 ( approx £ 25 ) my wife and I went for the express pass and chose not to go for the S$ 30 option which only gives you an express pass one time each ride. We headed straight for the main ride ( in my opinion ) which is the cylon v human roller coaster. As we approached the ride we were surprised to see that there was a 50 minute wait time for those with oi express passes. This wait, for those unfortunates, surprised me as the park still looked quiet. It became clear though why the wait was so long as my wife and I went straight to the front ( with our must have passes. ) when I noticed that the ride which once had 4 seats per row has been reduced to 2. Anyway, the ride was fantastic and we immediately went around again. After this we tried out the mummy, transformers, Jurassic park and a few others before heading for a Starbucks which are now in a prime location on the Main Street. Anyway, we had a great day but once again you must go for the S$ 50 express pass ticket for unlimited passes for the rides, it will be worth it, believe me. In the first hour we must have saved ourselves about 8 hours wait time.

The 11 45 show in waterworld I enjoyed the most. Revenge of the mummies, Transformers, Battlestar Galactica (human), Steven Spielberg storm show are some that you shouldn't miss.I spent the whole day starting at 11 am until 7 pm there. That should be enough to try out most of the interesting ones. Some queues could be really long and tiring and I felt some sitting could have been arranged in the queue areas, at least for the senior citizensAll in all, a good experience

review_327903484,“A Happy Place”,"Universal Studios Singapore is one of the main attraction for tourists who come to Singapore. When we first visited Singapore we bugged our parents to be in USS! It was wonderful inside! For someone who haven't yet experienced any DisneyLand places. This one is surely a happy place for me. So next time you visit Singapore, check out Universal Studios!TIP: Plan your USS trip for one whole day! There are lots of queueing and lots of walking in the sun! So come prepared.

review_327870480,“Awesome place to visit”,"This is the place you should never miss if you are in Singapore.I visited this place twice and it is really nice.Dont miss the USS parade at the end of the day(available only on weekends/special days).My fav ride is transformers.Pros:Nice location,easily accessible by MRT(harbour front,vivo city)Very nice staff.The staff helped us by clicking pics of us whenever we asked help.So many options for food.Restrooms are available near all rides.Lockers are also available to keep bags.All rides are well maintained and of good quality.Cons:Very crowded on weekends,so reach there at the time of opening to cover all the rides.Some rides like transformers may have waiting time over one hour.On weekends because of crowds,you may not be able to click photos with all characters.Food is little bit expensive inside USS.Evenings the sentosa express will be very crowded.Better to walk back to vivo city.

review_327512491,“When the big kids (and kids alike) come out to play”,"Would recommend going on a weekday ( we went on normal school weekday). Although expect atleast an 1 - 1.5 hours for lining up on the popular rides ( transformers, jurassic park) it wasnt too bad as the waiting area was well ventilated anyway. USS was very easy to navigate ( toilets, drink stations, lockers etc), would also suggest trying to get there from opening, as it does take the whole day to go around and ride most of the attractions. Let down was not being able to take lots of photos with the characters as sometimes they will not stop for photos. To make the most of it with kids, make sure they are within the height restrictions ( majority is 110 cms and above) Overall, it was a good experience for kids and adults.

review_327507867,“Hot Day in USS!”,"Visited mid-Nov after haze is gone. Took a MTR train to VivoCity and later boarded the Sentosa Express to USS. I noticed many people had their meals at VivoCity's food court and F&B outlets before going to USS as the F&B in USS is expensive. The Sentosa Express is packed and you have to squeeze into a 2 compartment on a weekend. They should either increase the frequency or no. of compartments during peak days/hours. At USS, waited as short as 10 mins and as long as 60 mins for a ride. Only managed few rides and left at 4.30pm. Should plan at least 2 days for USS and go during non-peak period. On our way back to VivoCity, we have to endure the same long queue and cramped compartments inside Sentosa Express.

Needless to say, the queues were just too overwhelming for most rides. We had fun. Wanted to try the Cyclon again at 6pm and didn't see the waiting time. Approached a staff who was busy on her phone being told with not so friendly face and tone ''Close! Close!'' I asked what time would it re-open. ''Close! Park close!'' Approached a staff at a shop and told park closed at 6pm. Surprised. Year end. Loads of tourists. No notices or announcement except on our way out we saw the notice 10 am to 6 pm. On a Monday? Much earlier tried to take a picture with the Minion mascot being pushed away. Shouldn't the staff be trained to be more professional and friendly? It is a fun place. Really disappointed.

However, even though the rides were amazing and thrilling, the attitude of the staff is questionable, they were a bit unfriendly and slightly rude.However, there are pros and cons ,but we should not linger on the bad things about the service and look at the pros of this attraction:)I would recommend bringing a poncho or raincoat just in case it rains, for the water world performance and the water rapid ride, for you will get soaked!USS itself is a lively and beautiful attraction. Not only does it have attractive rides, a real live Hollywood experience, but also a breathtaking scenery of different varieties of places even if it's from the movies, such as New York , Hollywood, Jurrasic World and many more!Universal Studios Singapore is an experience of a lifetime and is definitely worth the money and the time, and it is no doubt one of the best places to spend time with your family!

review_327040307,“Fun!!!”,"Loved the rides here. We got there soon after opening and hit the rides immediately. Transformers was the first and excellent. We then did Battlestar Galactica. Both sides were very cool with Cylon being the better of the 2. As the day went on the lines got longer and to the point where it was 90 minutes for a rollercoaster ride. You can purchase an express pass to make line shorter. Not sure of the price but would recommend it. The Jurassic Park ride broke down after we had already waited 30 minutes to go on it and were near the start of the line. We waited another 10 minutes and they gave us a one off express pass for any ride. We went back and they didn't take our pass off us. Food was standard for a amusement park, expensive and unimpressive but that was expected. Great day out with the rest of Sentosa to explore afterwards.

Having said that we paid extra for the express pass so we didn't have to spend any time in queues and that made a huge difference! We had no choice but to go on the weekend which is why we paid for the express pass but we also went early (got there before it opened) and the crowds were significantly smaller at the beginning of the day. For us the express pass was worth every single cent - we did everything we wanted to do and had time at the end of the day to take photos and we got back to our hotel in plenty of time to have a relaxing swim and some downtime before dinner. Beware though food is ridiculously expensive! We took our own water and had a huge breakfast before we went so we only needed a small snack.

review_326833058,“A short day at Universal Studios Singapore!”,"It was very inconvenient to redeem the ""Vitar"" (from Trip Advisor) e-voucher for a printed ticket at Universal Studios Singapore (USS). When we approached the USS Ticket Sales Counter, we were informed we had to find a certain kiosk (in the underground parking area, which was as hot as Dante's Inferno). The kiosk did not open until 10am. By that time, there was already a long queue at the main entrance when we returned to enter the USS park. So that negated the early jump we had on the crowd. Like other comments posted at this website, we were very annoyed to find that the best ride attractions (The Lost World, Ancient Egypt, and Water World) did not open until 1100. This is obviously a money-saving scheme by USS whereby they only have to pay employees salaries for an eight-hour day (i.e., 11am--7pm) at the three most popular attractions. (The park closes at 6pm, so USS probably factors in an hour to clean up, maintain the rides, and secure the park after the tourists get kicked out at 6pm.) The first ""Water World"" show was not until 1:15pm, so we did not see it. We thought that by going to USS while kids were in school (i.e., the low or off season) with less crowds that we could enjoy everything in a timely manner. Not a chance. We did not eat any expensive junk food at USS. We left at lunchtime for good food outside the park. Btw, do not buy your souvenir t-shirts at USS. Ask any cab driver to take you to ""Lucky Plaza Mall"". There you can get your kids three ""I Love Singapore"" t-shirts for SGD $10.00, instead of one USS shirt for SGD $20.00. What a sham experience to have at a ""world-class"" park--never again! I have been to the Universal Studios Park in Orlando, Florida, USA, and there is no comparison!

One thing I must warn though is that if you go on a Saturday or on school holidays there is basically no point going unless you buy the ""Express Unlimited Pass"" it will cost you another $70 Singapore dollars on top of the $75 you already pay for the ticket but it is well worth it, it puts you in a whole other line for the rides which mean you will be waiting on a very short period of time to get onto a ride. The people without these passes will wait in line for an hour plus per ride, and the wait time will ruin your whole day. If you aren't prepared to pay the extra money DO NOT go on a weekend or during school holidays you will just have a long day of standing in long lines in the heat. Once my wife and I got our passes we had a great time and I honestly felt bad for some of the people trapped in the ridiculously long lines for the rides. They have an estimated wait time put up above the line but these are bogus as well they were saying 70 minutes for one of the popular rides but I know from using the express pass to bypass the line that those people were waiting far longer than that. Its a great place if you are prepared to pay extra to jump the queue but if your not then only go when you suspect it will be really quiet otherwise you are going to have a bad day. P.S if storms are forecast DO NOT GO they shut down the rides and no refunds are given either for tickets or for express unlimited passes.

review_326243046,“Day well spent”,"We came here from Johor Bahru (a 2-hour+ travel, w/ customs/immigration clearance), and went straight here. I was expecting a childish theme park, but i was wrong. We didn't notice the time passing due to excitement. Once we got a map, we tried to see / ride all the attractions.My favorites were Transformers the Ride (we rode twice!), and Monster Rock. We even had a chance to participate in a mini-skit with the the Mummy characters. Alot of Side street shows, and appearances of Mascots from their movies. Luckily, we were early and there were no queues yet so we had made most of the park.All in all, a day well spent. Recommended for all.

review_326224172,"“well maintained, long queues for rides (even on weekday)”","went early on a weekday (tuesday) in hopes of shorter queues, to no avail, however, the queues for the kiddy rides were (very) slightly faster (in the earlier part of the day), and a good balance between indoor/outdoor queues so it's not always too hotthe transformer ride queue was obscenely long but the smart design of the queue (all indoor, air conditioned), with twists and turns, and screens and fiddly panels/buttons (which kept my little one entertained - ""fake"" control panels to play with at every turn) so i was thankful for that, made the wait seemed much shorter than it actually was! ride might be a tad scary for littler ones thoughbring (disposable) ponchos (and wear flipflops) if you are going for the Lost World Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure - bring a plastic bag for your electronics (it's not THAT wet that you'd need the locker - though we did rent one, regretted spending the money). shoes WILL get soaked, you have been warned - may or may not get too wet (depending on where you sit and how it turns) but it's best to use a poncho (they charge $2 or was it $4 for 1 there)the Ancient Egypt - Treasure Hunters ride was really not worth the long time we queued for it, and in the heat too, over in 5mins, skip this unless it's really short or you have an express pass (splitting your family up into 2s and sharing with express pass holders might get you ahead of the queue)for food, the chinese restaurant at the hollywood area has the lowest prices (and reasonably sized and good tasting food)there are water coolers spread throughout the park, so you can just bring an empty bottle to refuel, it's also considerately provided within the ride queues so you can quench your thirst while you queue, thumbs up for that!

review_326129787,“Awesome!”,"There are so many excellent rides, movies, meet and greets in this theme park, that it's difficult to know where to start. The Cylon, an inverted roller coaster is definitely the high point (or low point, depending on where you are on it) of the park. The other roller coaster was closed, sadly and there was a long line for Cylon. The Transformers ride is another high point. The visual effects and the jarring you feel while in the vehicle are too good. The flying over roof tops, falling down a hundred storeyed building and getting sucked inside a Transformer are all excellently simulated. A must visit. Meet and greet the Minions was another good point. We had a fairly long waiting period for most rides, even though it was a Wednesday and at one point in the afternoon, with overcast skies and all outdoor rides suspended for safety reasons, we felt that the visit might end up being a dour one. Thankfully, the skies cleared up and we could enjoy Cylon. The theme park is huge and you will require an entire day plus something to see it all. We missed the rapids of Jurassic Park and also the monorail roller coaster there. A must visit if you are in Singapore, very much worth the high price of entry.

review_326005320,“Amazing rides”,"I visit the park during a rainy day in august with my spouse. Although its a bit troublesome accessing the park using public transport, and have to battle the long que and the rain which pouring down to gain entrance, our experience in the transformers rides (one of the iconic park attraction) gave us something trully amazing to remember.I would recommend that you planned ahead before visiting the park, and its best to stay away during Rainy day, weekends or public holidays. Since the park area is relatively small compared with other universal studio, it would get crowded easily during the time i mentioned above.Buying a special pass is truly a wise spending, otherwise you might get stuck queing for hours before you can enjoy the ride.

review_325827153,"“Queue takes too long, Express ticket is not worth it”","I like how the rides are very varied. I went with my little sister, she's 10 years old and she has autism condition. She very much enjoyed the rides that are made for little kids, not to mention I did too. However, upon entering the attraction gates I noticed that queue takes TOO long. It takes around an hour for the Battlestar Galactica (human) just for my sister to break down and started screaming not wanting to go on it. I was disappointed on my sister, not the rides. However, I went there again after 2 days by myself and purchased the express ticket to cut off the incredibly long queue. It was around thirty dollars more, but I could only cut the queues once for every rides. Don't get this guys. It's just not worth it. However, my overall satisfaction, including the foods available is okay. Would definitely visit again if I was with my friends just to make the queue time more enjoyable by talking to them.

review_325690356,“A great day out! Great fun - suitable for all ages”,"I was a real cynic about this and had avoided it for over a year, based on previous experiences at similar parks in other countries where queues were excruciatingly long, crowds were huge and rides were short or poorly managed. I stand corrected.We visited with a family of 4 adults and 3 kids aged 4 to 8 and had a fantastic day out. We turned up at midday on a Friday and were disappointed to leave just before 7 pm.Rides had limited queues, somewhat longer towards the end of the day but still less than 30-40mins for the worst. Many rides had less than 10mins to wait, and at the start of the day everywhere we went we walked straight on! Staff were highly professional, friendly and service oriented.The park is big, but manageable size. You can cover the distance in a day with small kids - but be aware that you probably won't get round all the rides in that time. Divided into theme zones based on the movies with food outlets and themed rides for multiple ages in each section. Browsing the web I had originally been concerned that our 4 year old would not have much to do and would find the rides scary, but she had a blast! Lots of rides cater for younger children - with accompanying adults. She particularly enjoyed the water ride in Jurassic Park (no one got soaked, despite all the warnings and others of rain gear for sale!) and the 'roller coaster' based on the beanstalk from Puss in Boots.In terms of shows we found the street acts enjoyable, and the kids loved Donkey's Stand Up. The water world show was spectacular, but less suitable for young kids - fighting, guns and very loud noises/explosions.It rained heavily for some of the time we were there, but because many of the rides have covered waiting area we didn't really notice too much.Food options reasonable in choice and price, a bit on the fast good side but some outlets did slightly healthier options. Will gladly do it again.

review_325602653,"“don't go - save your time, money & sanity”","I'll reproduce here the letter of complaint I sent to them.I visited Universal Studios yesterday (Nov 9th) with my daughter hoping for a good time.I expected the crowds as it was a long weekend & being charged a premium price for crappy food is also a given in theme parks.What I did not expect was inaccurate wait time information given out at EVERY SINGLE ride. When we entered the Cyclon ride, were told the waiting time was 60 minutes to board the ride. We ended up waiting 120 minutes (2 full hours!!) We were tired, hungry, thirsty & suffocated by the end & couldn't even enjoy the ride! To top it off, the 102 minute free locker time had of course expired a long time after that. There were ALOT of unhappy customers who had no money (purses are locked in the lockers,of course!) to open the lockers. There was only one locker crew who was overworked & had to face a lot of angry customers. He ended up calling his manager who took 15 minutes to arrive. It was only after a lot of arguing by a lot of angry customers that the manager relented & opened up all the lockers without extra charge.We experienced the same wrong information at the Transformers ride. I specifically asked the ushers at the entry if their ""50 minute"" waiting time was accurate. They said ""yes"" confidently with a huge smile. We ended up waiting 80 minutes in total.I'm not complaining about the long waiting time for rides. It is expected during a long weekend holiday period. However, it is imperative that you give out accurate information about waiting times so we can decide how to make full use of our time in your theme park.The other point is - you already make plenty of money from the made in China stuffed toys & T-shirts which are marked up to premium prices, not to mention the overpriced crappy food. Making money from extended locker time after advertising false waiting times just sucks. Your customers feel really cheated & I for one, will never go back to RW Sentosa again & will definitely tell my friends & family my horrible experience.

review_325378859,“It will be a fun filled day!”,"Universal Studios Singapore (USS) was opened in 2010. New rides have been added since then. If you have the luxury of time, it's best to visit USS during the weekdays to avoid the crowd and the queue. The waiting time displayed for each ride is a good indication on how long you need to stand in line. Recommended rides will be The Mummy, Rapid Tides (Jurassic Park) and of course, the Battlestar Galactica: Human vs. Cylon. The Battlestar Galactica is a pair of duelling roller coasters (so both rides are launched concurrently together) and lasting for 90 seconds. You can tell which is the Human and Cylon coaster by looking at the colored tracks: red for Human and blue for Cylon. It's a thrilling ride, and personally enjoyed the Cylon coaster ;)You can find food and drinks in USS, but do note that the prices will be high. It's best to set aside a full day for this attraction.

review_324720291,“Smaller scale but fun”,"Don't expect a full scale theme park a la Universal Studios LA. What you will get is a smaller version with something for everyone. There is a couple of decent thrill rides and a few gentle rides and shows for the younger ones. A good half day for the family. We bought tickets online which worked well. There are also heaps of other great attractions nearby to fill a day. Easiest way to get there is MRT and monorail.

The food is great, the place is very clean and the staff are great and helpful especially if you have kids.

review_324620874,“Tips for Universal Studios Singapore”,"Universal Studios is Southeast Asia's first Universal Theme Park and it sure is popular with the tourists and locals alike. Here are some tips with regards to visiting the place!1) Avoid Singapore school Holidays. Many students have passes that enables them to go in unlimited times in 6 months! These passes come at very attractive prices so its going to be really crowded! Avoid especially the months of June to August, where many students are on holiday and even the countries around having their summer holidays! 2) Head straight for the main attractions first! If you are an adrenaline junkie, the best is to go for Transformers and Battlestar Galactica once the park opens! Jurassic Park Themed Area now opens at an official ceremony everyday at 11am, an hour after the park opens. So, do SciFi first and be at Jurassic at 11am. The Mummy has rather short queues all day round so you can leave that to the later parts!3) That bring be to my next point: BE EARLY! If you want to get the most out of a day in the park, be there half an hour early. The queue to the entrance forms early, so go early!4) Good rides to go for: Battlestar Galactica, Transformers, Puss in Boots, Jurassic River Rapids and The Mummy. The rest are okay. 5) Good and cheaper eating places include Mel's Diner and Jurassic Park Food Centre (cant remember the exact name). If you can wait, have lunch around 2 when the crowds are gone and do rides around that time. 6) Shows are the best time to hit the rides at Jurassic and Far Far Away. Okay that's about it! Have fun!

review_324593189,“Most Amazing Experience in Singapore”,"I started early and on a weekday. Still it was so popular and crowded that I had to await for most things. Well, I am not complaining. It was some promo and abou SGD 76 per person for one day visit. You can also opt for 2 day or combo pass.Late in morning till late afternoon was crowded and long queue but just before evening - no queue! So I enjoyed Mummy ride and transformer rides twice :)Then there are the sets and actors/models posing dressed as characters from Shrek, The Mummy, Waterworld.Transformer ride was 3D and you can only enjoy it. period. Waterworld was the full show! with blasts, gun-shots and water scooters, even a airplane !Far far away and Madagascar sets were there. Then we even managed to get amused by a 7D small film as well ;)Foods were expensive inside, so was locker; but if you could just manage to take something in to fill your stomach, you will survive. carry plenty of water on a sunny day as you will get plenty of sunOnly one advice - never miss a ride :)

review_324567927,“Fun!”,"I loved Universal Studios in Singapore! I went with my daughter. And since we were there end October, of course, we met Frankenstein first and it was awesome!This place is really a great place to be with family and have fun. I think we were able to do most of the major rides like Jurassic Park's water ride and Far Far Away, Transformers, The Revenge of the Mummy and of course, Battlestar Gallactica rides (Human and Cylon).I think I liked Revenge of the Mummy the most because the experience starts when you get to fall in line. The props and the atmosphere is fantastic, almost believable. Loved it!Overall, I recommend going to Universal Studios Singapore especially if your stay is short. This shouldn't be missed.

He went alone, and lo! and behold, we was up there. He was so happy that he rode it again. We also tried the other rides, also heart-stopping, like the mummy ride, canopy ride, etc. At the end of the day we were famished, even after having a hearty and big lunch at the Discovery Food Court inside the Universal.

review_324372587,“great”,"1- Universal Studios, Singapore is a theme park located on the island of Sentosa within the premises of Resort World, Singapore. It is the second Universal Studio Theme park to open in Asia and first in Southeast Asia. It’s a jolly good place to spend an amazing day with your family and friends. The park consists of seven themed zones- Hollywood, New York, Sci-Fi City, Ancient Egypt, The Lost World, Far Far Away, and Madagascar. It’s a beautiful and extremely fun place to be. The mascots are really cute to click pictures with and the amazing settings just make one feel surreal. It’s the kind of place that people of all ages would love to be at. All in all, no one would get out of the park disappointed. The money would feel all worth it and there would be a longing to return to it again and again.

review_324352411,“dissapointing”,"I don't want to say that I am any sort of theme park expert but I have been to a few. Disneyland(LA), Disney World(Florida), Disneyland(Japan), Universal (LA), Seaward(San Diego), Seaward(Aust),Dreamworld(Aust) & I'm sure that their are others I've missed. Universal in Singapore is in no doubt the worst of the lot. Don't get me wrong, you can have an enjoyable day here, just don't expect too much. I arrived at opening 10am on a Wednesday, No queue to get in, probably under 200 people in total to get in. WOW, shouldn't be a crowd at all. Correct, I think I went on all the rides by midday, longest wait was 5 minutes. I was not complaining but that was it for the day. I spent the next 6 hours going back on more rides, checking out the shops, food outlets etc. The park is extremely small and the ride selection is very limited. I would guess and say the whole park is less than 20% of the size of Disneyland in either Tokyo or LA. Did I enjoy myself for the day, Yes. Would I go back again, probably not. It's something you need to probably do, but don't go on a day with crowds and don't expect too much.I cannot complain about staff, cleanliness, food or anything else. Everything was really good. It's as simple as there was not a lot to do.

review_324197237,“Family fun even in the queues!”,"You need a good one full day to enjoy this attraction. However you need to prioritise and choose wisely which ride/attraction is worth queueing for. Mummy returns is a must. There were a few rides that were out of order that day which were actually the popular ones, which was a shame but anyways there were a lot more to enjoy. Check the weather forecast and bring a parka in case it rains because there are often no shade outside the attractions. Enjoy a bit of turkey leg while taking a rest. Restaurants are a bit pricey but I can recommend the Chinese resto to be on the safe side, food is lovely and more reasonably priced compared to the rest.

review_324145436,“Halloween Heart Attack!”,"This Universal is much smaller than those overseas, but still offers the main attractions such as the Mummy ride, Jurassic Park etc. We visited on Halloween and it was pretty intense. Lots of people having a really great time, but I was pretty terrified. My hubby was laughing at me the whole time and whenever I hid behind him he would offer me up to the ghoulies! At one point the look of terror on my face was enough to make one of the character actors burst out laughing!Actors and their costumes are spot-on and a real tremendous amount of effort was put in by the events team, no doubt. I paid for the express tickets when I booked. It says to book them early as numbers are severely limited to keep express lane queues short. We visited on a night where all entry tickets were but TAKE NOTE the express passes were still being sold everywhere around the park that evening night for about $10 cheaper per ticket. Also, since so many express tickets were sold, even the express lanes for the rides had a 20-30 minute wait. When I visited Universal Florida the express ticket line was usually completely empty, so that was a bit disappointing. Normal queues that night were even longer though, we would never have gotten to see everything if we hadn't purchased express passes.All in all, we made it around all the attractions in one evening, as well as the haunted houses. It was pretty expensive for one evening's entertainment, but it gave us an experience we were still talking about months later. Would I go again? On a normal day, probably not, to be honest, but if they have another really cool themed Halloween event and I'm feeling brave enough I will be there with my express pass at the ready for sure.

review_323539258,“An all round awful experience”,"Visited USS for their much heralded Halloween event this year.Having visited theme parks all over the world, I can honestly say this was the worst experience I have ever encountered at one. The number of people admitted to the park was frankly irresponsible and there was not a fraction of the number of attractions available to cater to these hoards. We arrived to the park at approximately 7pm and remained until 1:30am. During that time we saw 4 attractions (2 terrible haunted houses, 1 ok haunted house and 1 half hour cartoon on a movie screen). The combined time spent in the attractions was less than 40 minutes and we spent the remaining 5 hours and 50 minutes standing in queues. 3 two minute walkthroughs and a 30 minute cartoon for $60 per person.Now I know queuing is part and parcel of a theme park experience, but standing in line for 2 hours and 40 minutes, with horrible, blinding red/blue strobe lights pointed at your face just to spend two minutes walking through a poorly decorated train filled with bored and unenthusiastic student actors is unreasonable. There were a couple of rollercoasters open. Earlier in the evening, we queued for a ride called ""The Mummy"". Having been in line for approximately 20 minutes, we were told the ride was now in fact closed and we needed to move on.Later in the evening, shortly after midnight, we noticed that the queues for the Battlestar Galactica roller coaster were shorter than the time indicated at the gate. We stood in line here for approximately 40 minutes, only for the intercom to come on again and announce they there were experiencing technical difficulties and there would be further delays. As we were about to leave, we overheard a member of staff telling a group (friends of his I presume) in front of us to hold still, that they were making the announcement to cut the crowd so they could finish on time. Considering the price paid for tickets which advertised an event open until 1am, we thought this was completely unacceptable. We stayed for another 30 minutes but as the queue wasn't moving, and after several more announcements, we left feeling extremely annoyed.It's hard to blame the staff (who must have had a tough night), but that this could happen, shows the same lack of management that resulted in many times more guests being allowed to pay into a park, than had facilities available to accommodate them.The whole thing smacked of a truly dishonest scheme designed to milk as much money as possible out of a huge number of people, with very little effort or thought given in return. First time in my life I have been genuinely angry to have paid admission to a theme park.

review_323394564,“Tips to maximize your time & enjoyment at Universal Studios. ...”,"Universal Studios is open from 10am to 6pm- so you only have 8 hours to try and experience every ride, every show & browse through every shop, stop for food/drinks, take photos along the way with various characters. On top of all these, add in many hours of long queue times for the various rides. Quite an impossible task ie to cover everything in one day, even if you come at 10am & leave at 6pm. 1. Not every ride, every show is suitable for everyone nor will all be enjoyed by everyone. Decide which rides or shows interest you most or your family/group & go only for those selected ones first. Prior advance research planning through Universal Studio (US) website will better help in making the right choices earlier rather than on site, thus saving time.2. Buy your tickets online so you have more time for your enjoyment rather than wasting time queuing for tickets. Avoid weekends or national holidays if possible, as it is definitely much more crowded.3. It is pretty hot & very humid all year round here. Wear cool clothings & comfortable shoes as you will be walking for many hours mostly in the open - under the hot sun!Put on a cap or hat & wear a sunglass- be amazed at how much your comfort level increases.4. Food & drinks are always very expensive in all theme parks all over the world. One tends to get hungry & thirsty often walking many hours under the hot sun.Take a heavy meal before coming, at Vivo City or Harbour Front Mall. Go to the supermart there & buy some mineral water, sandwiches or snacks for later breaks. You will be surprised at how much savings are made. There are water coolers at various points of the park, which one can refill drinking water. 5. Take the Monorail to Universal Studios. It is cheap, comfortable & convenient & stops directly at US. Cable car is expensive & buses not so convenient. Monorail station is located on 3rd level of Vivo City Mall.6. Besides rides, shows & shops- look out for 2 very good singing & dancing performances near Sesame Street. At different times of the day , The Cruisers ( 4 young guys) & Mel's Drive-in ( 3 young gals) sing & dances a medley of beautiful songs of the 80s-90s. For those who can still remember the show 'Happy Days/Fonzie'- well, they sing these 'era type' songs on a stage with a Jukebox behind.Mind, they are really very, very good- certainly a great joy watching them. In fact, we watchd 'The Cruisers' a second time on our way back the same street in late afternoon. 7. Finally, carry a small umbrella with you. Weather here can change very suddenly from hot sun to rains. And rains here can be very heavy. You don't want to be stuck in one of the shops for long time waiting for rains to stop instead of using your limited time to enjoy the place.

My favourites are Transformer the Ride, Revenge of the Mummy and the new attraction - Puss in Boots.For kids - Sesame Street Spaghetti Space Chase is my recommendation (NOT the musical performance), it's better than the Madagascar: A Crate Adventure which is of similar nature. However, there was one thing that disappointed me and my friend. On our day of visit, queues for the attractions were not long (around 5-20 mins wait time) except for the Battlestar Galactica. My friend an I queued for the HUMAN and the wait time shown on the screen is 45 mins. All riders must put their belongings in the locker, and the locker service is free for the first 65 mins. We thought there must be sufficient time and we wont be charged - however, it was not the case. When we are about to get on the ride after a 45 mins wait (around 5 ppl queuing in front of us), an announcement was broadcasted informing us that they experienced technical problem and there would be a short delay. We waited for 20 mins until the ride resumed normal, but 65 mins has already passed. The express pass queue got long during that period and they have priorities so we waited for another 6-7 rounds before we can get on the ride. The ride is just so-so, not exciting at all. When we finished the ride and went to our lockers, we were charged for S$6. It was completely a waste of time and money.

review_322906247,“Crazy fun!”,"We thought bout coming here in the early morning to beat the crowd. Unfortunately we didn't wake up in time and only arrived around 1pm -- DONT DO WHAT WE DID! GO EARLY so you don't have to line up at all!For the tickets - we had a 10% discount or something like that if you paid via Mastercard. I didn't know anything about a promotion but supposedly if you use mastercard, you get discounts on most of the amusement areas @ Sentosa! We went on most of the rides except for Battlestar Galactica - the red and blue rollercoaster. THAT RIDE WAS OVER ONE HOUR WAITING.! So we didn't get to go.I advise all of you to go when it first opens so you can go on every ride.I really enjoyed THE MUMMY ride - its a rollercoaster in the dark. We went 8+ times and went about 3 more times 40 mins before closing time because the lines disappeared... We also missed a few shows due to the lack of time we had so we were rushing through trying to finish each ""area"".For some rides, you can't go without a bag or phones, etc so they do have lockers. The one near THE MUMMY is free for the first 45 mins then 4SGD for the next hour or something like that.. GOOD DEAL THO! Just get the fast pass especially during peak periods. I wish I did! Especially if you're that kind of person who hates waiting in lines...You can finish the whole park in 1 day- just make sure you arrive when it first opens. Enjoy yourself if you go - IT WAS FANTASTIC!!!! I will come again when I visit Singapore in the near future!

review_322858830,“Cheated on the Express Pass and Bad Customer Service”,"The online ticketing system is confusing and not user friendly. We bought 7 express passes with the admission passes for the Halloween Horror Night in a single transaction and only found out they were valid for the day admission. The system did not prompt us that wrong express passes were bought and they were not clearly indicated in the system.The guest manager at the park was inexperienced and unprofessional. We were offered exorbitant top up price that looks like day light robbery. After much frustration and waste of time, he conceded to our offer of $10 each - which was a fair price to everyone as that's the price we would have paid if the right ticket was bought at the first price. The unpleasant experience affected our mood and we left the park early. This issue was feedback to USS and I was again dismay with their response! They acknowledged the problem but offered nothing in return. What is the point of given them feedback? Waste of time!

review_322841726,“My second visit”,"Bought the Day pass & Halloween Horror Nights pass. In fact this is my 2nd time here. I like this place so much, enjoy taking photo of all the special man-made building, don't care if it's fake, the fact is it's nice and attractive. Many interesting attractions and rides. My favourite ride was Transformers 3D, Revenge of the Mummy & Jurassic Rapid Adventure. Do check out Steven Spielberg's Lights, Camera. Action! I didn't really have to queue during my first visit in Feb 2014, the queue were terrible during my 2nd visit, luckily we got ourselves express pass at night or else we'd have to queue for almost 100 mins for each haunted house. The haunted houses were quite scary if you're going in pairs. I can see the efforts made in building the haunted houses and scare zones. I feel it's worth despite paying SGD 110 per pax.

review_322663329,“Tips for visit to Universal Studios”,"1. Tickets for Universal Studios can be bought online or through a travel agent...if you buy them from travel agents in Little India, you can get a good deal at 60 SGD with a 5 SGD food coupon included.. The food coupon will really come handy as the meal comes nothing less than 11 to 12 SGD... The best place to eat is at the food court to the opposite of the Lost World2. Please reach by 9 to 9:15 am if you are going on weekends and stand in a queue at any of the entry gate instead of clicking photos and selfies in front of the Universal Studio Globe... There is usually a huge rush on Saturdays & Sundays and you will end up waiting for 45 to 50 mins at every ride.. You will get ample time for photo sessions at the end of the day as the studio closes by 5pm sharp3. If you are an adventure and thrill seeking person start walking towards the right where the majority of adrenaline pumping rides are located - Transformer, Gallactica, Revenge of the Mummy4. If you are there with the kids, it's better to walk towards the left and head for rides like Madagascar, Puss in the Boots, Donkey Live, Shrek Adventure, Jurassic Rapid Water Adventure, Canopy Flier, etc5. If you want to enjoy at least 80% of all the rides in one day (which is quite a task in itself), please don't get tempted for photo sessions... There are a lot of ""pretty"" distractions all over the place which would rob you of the opportunity to try most of the rides6. If you are going in a big group (min 5 and above) it's wiser to book the biggest locker for 20 SGD for the entire day just at the right side of the entrance... Please note that there are not many of these big lockers.. So you need to book it in the morning..

review_322600653,“Singapore's Disneyland”,"Universal Studios Singapore was amazing. The rides and attractions are plentiful, and so are the crowds. Remember to go early, right when the park opens as the queues will be significantly shorter. You'll start thanking your lucky stars around lunch time when everyone pours in. However if you'll only be able to make it after lunch or during peak periods, don't fret. The express tickets are worth it in this situation, though pricey. Queue for the rides if the queues are short, and when the crowd comes in, use your express ticket to jump all the way to the front. Something you should make a beeline for is the Battlestar Galactica Rides, especially the Cylon Ride. Whether you're scared of roller coasters or not, these rides are a MUST TRY. Once wasn't enough for me but the waiting time was at 180 minutes, so I did not queue again. The food and drinks in the park are expensive, so bring along some snacks and a bottle to fill up at the numerous water coolers dotted in the park if you're going to be there for a long time. (You will)All in all, enjoy yourself, it is amazing.

review_322593799,"“""Universal Studios Singapore: Halloween Horror Nights""”","It was nice to enter the theme park after dark, at the same time, I raise the question on security as no bags were checked upon entering and I still see young children at the theme park even though this event was meant for 13 years old & above. However, the overall experience was alright. It was very crowded but the crowd was very co-operative when it comes to queuing up for the rides, or even to the lockers. Do keep your belongings safe because it was truly very dark at certain areas. Therefore, be safe rather than be sorry.The washroom was very clean which I was very impressed. Didn't get to try the food but there were some cute blood bags (you can reuse the bags to insert drinks) were sold as part of the celebration of Halloween Horror Nights. The haunted houses were quite fun. It would have been scarier if people were to enter the premise in a small group of 6 - 8? It seemed like there was no system and everyone was guided to enter the haunted houses in a go, which reduced the fun factor. Nevertheless, a big congrats to the scare crew and team as they did a great job. Would recommend for people who have not been to Universal Studios' Halloween Horror Nights to give it a go while the event is still on. Remember to buy the Express Pass so you can cut the line, since it is so crowded!!! Have fun! :)

Otherwise you will ended up lining up to 100 min' per attraction. For the halloween event, there's some scare zone and haunted house. The effects are really nice. All the details for the halloween stuff are just so creative. You can buy ""halloween"" food and drinks. I love the set up for this event. Note that you will have to line up from 5.

review_322089482,“Universal Family Fun”,"A visit to universal studios with an 8 year old and a 10 year old - perfect ages (and heights) to enjoy all of the rides. Based on available online advice we booked tickets online directly with resorts world to save on queues on arrival. You can save some cash by using certain credit cards when you pay, but this feature didn't work so well when I tried. Also, you'll need access to a printer for your tickets. We didn't opt for the universal express pass as it added $30 to each, already expensive, ticket. However, when we arrived at the first ride, Jurassic Park Rapids, and spent 40 mins waiting on a not-so-busy weekday, we realised the value of the straight-to-the-front express pass. You can only use it once per ride but it will save you hours of waiting and enable you to experience everything (once) in one day - obviously, this assumes that everyone else doesn't fork out the extra cash and joins your express queue! The rapids were fun and wet, and the waterworld show (twice daily) was fun, wet and noisy (perhaps a bit violent for really young ones). Transformers ride was the most nauseating but loved by the children, especially as they got to meet Optimus and Bumblebee afterwards at a meet and greet. The battle star roller coaster provides the most exhilarating rides in the park and should be kept until last, otherwise the other rides seem quite tame. Suggest riding red track and then blue, as the (blue) cylon ride loops and corkscrews to really get the heart rate up. We saw the break dancers at the New York zone involve the audience and put on a good show. The whole day will cost a packet once you factor in the odd snack and pressure to buy the usual commercial tat on offer at the gift shop each big ride exits into. As a special treat, Universal Studios is hard to beat for family fun. Highly recommended 4.5 stars (would be maximum score if it wasn't so hard on the wallet!)

review_321770133,“One of the Must Visit Places in Singapore.”,"Universal Studios is one of the must visit places in Singapore. It is an enjoyable place to visit with your family. There are rides that young children would enjoy, and also rides that teens and older children would like.  You can go there by the MRT or a cab. But during rush hours, in the MRT, it would be a little crowded. A cab would cost more money than MRT but it's more convinient. There were many people there, during the day we visited. So, we decided to buy an express pass for $50 and it was worth it. The queue in the express pass wasn't that long anymore. We saved about 30 minutes for each ride. The queue for the express line was just about 10 minutes. So we had plenty of time to try all the rides. Some of the highlight rides that you should try are the Cyclon, and the Mummy rollercoaster. If you have no express pass, it would be about an 1 hour queue for both of them. But if you had express passes, it would take about 5-10 minutes depending on the time. There are also 3D rides and 4D movies. I went there with another 5 year old kid and she enjoyed the Shrek 4D movie. It was kind of funny and worth it to queue up. The 3D rides is the Transformer ride.

review_321579217,“All over a bit too soon but some highlights made the trip worthwhile.”,"We visited on a Friday in October (family of 4 - 2 adults / 2 teens)The park was open 10-6 (Halloween Horror Nights necessitating a slightly early daytime closure).We arrived about 9.30am tickets in hand (pre-booked through AsiaTravel) and the gates opened about 9.35am so worth getting in line early.The day was listed as a peak day so we avoided spending the $50 on express passes until we had seen what the queues were like.We did the rides in the following order:Transformers (5 min wait) - great rideBattlestar Galactica Cyclon (25 mins wait - some technical issue) - v smooth multiple looping coasterMummy (5 mins standby line) - fun dark coaster.Jurassic Rapids (30 mins standby) - got v wet!The lines then started to grow fast (by about 11.30am) so at that point we bought 2 express passes for the kids (both adults having had about enough excitement/motion sickness anyway).The kids then did the Jurassic flyers using their passes (avoiding a 45 min queue) + Puss in boots coaster (avoiding another 45 mins queue).We had then been planning to go to the Waterworld show at 1.30pm but the show was cancelled due to air pollution/haze...So we had some lunch (round 1.30pm)We all did Shrek 4D together - 15 mins standby waitThe kids did the other Shrek coaster using their passes (avoiding a 45 min queue) then we all did the Madagascar ride (5 mins standby) - by which point it was about 2.30pm and we had completed our first 'loop' of the park.The adults then retired to a pretty expensive bar in 'New York' for 45 mins while the kids used up their remaining Express Passes (BSG Human (avoiding a 90 mins queue), Cyclon again (avoiding a 50 min queue), Mummy (avoiding a 30 min queue), Jurassic (avoiding a 45 min queue).So all in all, by about 4pm we were done. Without the express passes we could have probably done everything (once) but would have spent another 2 hours (at least) in queues and the kids would have gone on less rides.On balance, I think the $50 each for the 2 Express passes was worth it for us but if you are more used to the heat and happy to wait in line to save a bit of money you could have covered everything between 10 and 6 (just).

review_321577998,“Good for family and friends”,"I went with my friends, who had a ""priority pass"" to access the special line when queuing. I obviously also got one of these tickets that are a bit more expensive..but hey it was worth it. We did not have to queue for too long and therefore had more time to enjoy the studios to the fullest.My favourite ride was the Transformers - never seen anything similar. It's all made with 3-D; super cool!The decoration in the Jurassic Park themed area was really nice, too. And all the little things around the Universal studios ware very nice.A must see.

review_321263951,"“Prepare well, you'll have a great time (Express!!!)”","1. We went on a Friday, it was still very busy. So after the first doubt, we ran back to get an Express lane ticket (tip: you can actually get them in most of the shops throughout the park). 2. You could bring an extra shirt, or a poncho, but in Singapore it is not really needed. Do make sure your shoes can get wet. Although flipflops are everyone's favorites, it might be handy to have something that stays on in a no-floor rollercoaster, but you can take them off too.3. If you have to leave your stuff in a safe (you'll get the first 30 or so min for free), don't forget to bring your wallet (or, tip: EZ Link card) so you can pay to get your stuff back.Our top 3 attractions, so, MUST do:1. Transformers ride - I went with two little girls, this was their fav too.2. Revenge of the mummy - make sure your kid is not easily scared.3. Jurassic Park Rapids - especially in Singapore climate, getting wet is always fun.So, surprisingly, no Battlestar Galactica Human (red) or Cylon (Blue), although those were definitely worth it.Top 3 disappointments. Really, don't bother:1. Accelerator - wow, some people actually went in with a 30min wait line. Boriiiing.2. Treasure Hunters - I cannot believe the long line for this. Mine are 9 and 12, this was still a total bore. 3. Canopy Ride. Barely making this list, meaning you could still do it if lines are short.If you do NOT buy an Express lane ticket, only the top 3 are worth the long wait.Some more, random tips and comments:* Puss in Boots was busier than it deserves. On top, they said it was a 20min wait but it was well over that, more like 40min. This was our first ride and we got out after 20 to buy the express tickets. Then we took it later and it was fine. My youngest was smart and suggested that maybe it was so busy because it is good for all ages. It's not a wild ride and beautifully built, but I still think the wait shouldn't be more than 20min. You may have more time to waist though :-)* With the Canopy ride, 2 out of 4 riders will go backwards. Personally, I did not like that. And you cannot make 'reservations' for front seat.* The RED (Human) was an ok rollercoaster. Much less 'scary' or 'thrilling' than you would expect though.* We didn't actually do the BLUE (Cylon). It does roll all the way over, but they said it was less pressing than the RED line and hence could even be a bit smoother (=less thrilling).* The Madagascar boat ride was ok story telling and the line moves fast, but could have been a little bit more exciting. Again, I would have been disappointed after a long wait of more than, say 20min.* I loved the Express tickets, but I'm not the only one. Occasionally, you'll still have to wait in the Express lane. The longest we had to wait was with the Canopy ride. There was also a wait when we tried earlier for the Puss in Boots, but when we finally went, they said it was 5min but we were the only ones arriving.* The best food is actually at the beginning. It's busy though! Very busy. I think next time I'll walk out of the park to check the restaurants at the entrance. After lunch, you can walk right back in.* Bring a water bottle if you don't want to pay SGD 6. You can find fountains along side the wait line paths of the attractions. You won't find them outside on the walking routes though.* Of course: book online!

The atmosphere is great and there are lots of shows and other rides (many for younger kids). Halloween Horror Nights at USS is also an event not to be missed.

review_321075640,“Disappointing”,"Full disclosure - I am not a huge fan of amusement parks and rarely go. However, I thought my pre-teen children would enjoy this place. I'm trying to think of positive things to say...it is clean and there are lots of toilets. If you do not buy a unlimited express ticket I can only describe the experience as nightmarish. Standing on a line for 90 minutes watching those who can afford the express tickets (which cost more than entry to the park itself) ""jump"" the queue is infuriating. So is being told a wait would be 30 minutes and it turning out to be 3x as long. And this was on a weekday that was not a public holiday in Singapore. My view is that there are many other more interesting things to do on Sentosa Island than stand around for hours to have a 3-minute roller coaster ride. However, judging from the other positive reviews I recognise this is a minority opinion!

If u visit on weekends, u will miss out many attractions because the waiting time will be in hours! We visited on a weekday, but we had to miss few good attractions as the waiting time was more and had to stand in long long queues. Universal Studios may consider limiting the number of visitors on a day. Entry fee is 75S$ (onspot). There are express tickets available at many attraction at an extra cost which will allow you to bypass the queue. There is a VIP pass too for some 200 S$ !!. Any how it is a costly affair ;). Place is worth a visit, really enjoyable. Do not miss Transformers, Mummy hunt, Water-world. Start early in the morning and avoid rainy days as a few attractions get cancelled due to rain.

review_320087559,“Halloween Horror Night 2015 - Horror at its best from the 3-hours Queue!”,"As the parent and host of a group of six 13 to 14 year-olds, I felt compelled to set aside time to express the disappointment and emotions of these teens.My girl rallied her friends to save up their weeks of pocket money so they could experience the much publicized Halloween Horror Night. They managed to get their regular tickets online with our help for Saturday, 17 October.The much anticipated day came and mentally prepared for queue, the group made their way and arrived at USS, half hour early. And boy, were they horrified!The horror was not so much the wonderful works put up by the team and performers, but from the long wait! The group of teens were looking forward to a night of fun, and a memorable experience of Halloween Horror Night at USS but what greeted them were bouts of negativities from the surrounding upset and aggressive visitors from long wait and dispute on queue jumping plus their own exhausting long wait of over 3 hours for every haunted house! The 6 teens spent nearly $500 on their tickets and the high-priced beverages just so they could join the endless queue!By 1.30 am, weak and exhausted the group have only visited 3 attractions. With no more energy and money left to pay for their way home, no prize for guessing who had to fetch them home in the wee-hours.The group of teens, having survived their ordeal is trying to comprehend what has seriously gone wrong with the management of USS. Was it not a destination that creates positive experience? Have chasing after money gotten into their heads? Do they just care only about money? “It is disgusting to see that they have planned for the long queue and had positioned these drinks kiosk right at where we queued!” Those were the questions and verbatim of your young customers, USS.3 hours of queue for each attraction, seriously, USS? Why would any management spent so much efforts to build an awesome set of props just to pissed customers off just because they have not purchased the express tickets? Guess it is time for the team to reflect if causing disappointment, agony and disgust is part of the objectives of HHN 2015.With that addressed, our teens would like to acknowledge that the performers were professional and totally committed to their role. If all else fails, the performers deserved mention.

Also, something like this has not been opened yet in India. If you go to Singapore, this is one place to go for sure. Transformers ride and Mummy ride were the best. Madagascar's ride was also fun, great for the kids. Water show was really a treat to watch. If you are going to Singapore for less number of days, I would suggest you take an express pass which will cost you 60 dollars extra, so that you can avoid the long lines.

review_319725298,"“Very good if you pay for a fast pass, average otherwise”","After reading a few reviews, we decided the Fast pass was worth the extra cash and it was. My strategy for the Fast Pass would be to decide what kind of ride person you are -how likely are you to want to redo the thrill type rides. If you arrive first thing in the morning and can get on the premium rides when the queues are short then don't waste your Fast pass then -use it when you want to have a second go on these. I was travelling with a teen girl who wasn't keen on the really high thrill rides so we just went once on everything except the three really high level thrill rides and for us, the Fast Pass was worth it for not having to queue for 45 minute to 85 minutes later in the day. However, we did use it on the Transformers ride early in the day when the queue was short and it was the one ride my teen would have redone (you can only use the pass once on each ride) and in hindsight we would have been better off just queuing for that ride early on and then saving the pass for later. We were disappointed that the haze meant the Waterworld show was closed for both sessions and the decisions were both made at the last minute so we hung around hoping the second show might go on when it was probably likely that it was never going to happen however, that's life. I found food prices to be reasonable for this type of venue.If you buy your ticket directly from the venue online then don't queue at the ticket office - just go straight to the gate as they scan straight from your online purchase. Even though we were there on a Monday, it was still pretty busy but we found that because of the cancellation of the show, we were pretty much done by 3pm.

review_319686027,"“If you have the time and money, a must do!”","Had a lot of fun on the rides, the only tip, always check if it's a public holiday or school holiday, lines can get up to over an 1hr long for the popular rides, if its the only time you can go, make sure you get express passes, they cost about the same price as the entry fee, but it's so worth it (10 -15 min wait max most times compared to 45-60 min wait), otherwise you wont get to go on to many rides and then you miss out on a lot of the other shoes etc. The best ride i was able to get on was the transformers ride. Best ride i have ever been on. If i could i would have kept going on the ride. If you have young kids, hire a stroller, they have stroller parking bays all of the place so that you dont miss out on rides. And most of the thrill rides have lockers near by so you can store your stuff for free for a short time. Plenty of places to eat and rest as well. Was not able to give 5 stars because was not able to experience the whole park due to the public holiday and the amount of people.

review_319508119,“A must visit”,"We visited universal studios back in October 2010 during my honeymoon as can remember it as if it happened a few hours ago. The experience was great, specially that we didn't have kids at that time we were able to make most of the rides except the ones that were not operating yet. I must say the mummy ride is one of the best rides I have been to till date, I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise so I'll leave it to that. The parades and walk through places in the universal studio is easy and quick at least during our time there. The park was in perfect condition and the staff were very attentive and were able to answer every query we had. A lot of nice spots to make memory photos specially when ur with family or couples! I'm looking forward to take my son as soon as he turns 7 or 8 so he can enjoy what we did. The only thing that could have been reviewed are the prices, food and souvenirs around were a bit pricey, however that's the case all around Singapore. So you make sure you have a heavy pocket going there. I heard of this other ride that we haven't experienced because it's new called the transformer. I would love to experience that as well.

review_319500523,"“If you really want to go, go weekdays.”","was aware that it is better to visit on a weekday, but we delayed our visit for days due to the haze situation. In the end we could delay no longer as we had plans for our other days, so ended up visiting on a still very hazy and busy Saturday. If you do end up visiting on a Weekend, you will most likely find it a bit of a waste of a day, queuing for in some cases over an hour for a ride of ninety seconds. Yes you can buy an express pass and bear the queue, but even those were backing up with 20-30 minute wait times. The rides we tried in the main were not all that exciting. The best one by far being The Mummy. We were lucky enough to get on that late in the day with a short queue. Brilliant ride. The river rapids was a close second, but the wait was excruciatingly long. Something that irked us was the blatant queue jumping. Not to be racist, but an Indian guy pushed way down the line until he found some fellow countrymen and attempted to ingratiate himself with them. They clearly were not his friends, but they did nothing, then he gestured towards the very back for his friends to come forward. We were not having that, and made sure he was aware of that. Rather than look an idiot and push to the back of the queue he stayed where he was until his friends caught up. In a country like Singapore you sort of expect the culture to be more rigid in the respect of manners and etiquette. It didn't seem so, and few people have the balls to stand up themselves when affronted by such behavior. Sad, but trivial really. The park is not particularly extensive. It is basically one circuit around a lagoon. On a quiet day I doubt you would struggle to see it all in less than 3 or 4 hours. I probably would not go back, but pleased I have had the opportunity to say I have been. If you are a die hard theme park fan, then by all means tick it off your list. Just don't do it on a weekend as it is oversubscribed for the rides and facilities to enjoy it properly during this time. Otherwise just because it is in Singapore it's not a excuse that you must see it.

review_319435544,“Great theme park for older kids”,"It was hazey when we went there. Crazy hot and humid, we waited 15mts for water show only to be told that it had been cancelled. Seriously, if it was unlikely to happen they should have just cancelled it instead of making hundreds of people wait. One of the staff was rude when we tried to take a short cut and went under the bollard. We didn't cut the line! We went at the back of the line, she was just being a PITA. Also, any reason why my 8 y.o son couldn't take his Tshirt off before going on a wet ride? It wasn't like he was only wearing undies, he had shorts on. I personally wouldn't take kids under 4 there because most rides are for at least 4 y.o (and over 110cm). With the heat, queue and it also means someone has to stay with the little one, It's not worth the money. Another budget tip: buy your tickets from local travel agents (ie those at Lucky plaza) as you could save quite bit of money.

One must manage his expectations especially with the crowd.. it can take over an hour just to ride the main attractions! but some are quite worth-it (i.e., Transformers).

review_318825006,“Can't miss it!!”,"If can't read the entire stuff, read my tips at the bottom.First thing first, I am an Indian and we don't have any such place (not of this level, quality whatever you may wanna call it). The moment we entered, I knew this is going to be fun filled place. We kinda had half day at this place so we decided to only go for the rides we don't have in India. We started with Transformer ride, 4D at its best, say no more, think no more. I actually felt how Shia LaBeouf or any character of the movie would feel, had it been a REAL thing. Worth everything!!Second came the rollercoster, boy oh boy!! I was scared but i had to do it because it would be once in a lifetime stuff. I have been screaming during entire ride. So much fun. Third, the mummy ride, this was again awesome experience.Next we went for a couple of kids ride as we were with another family Shrek show, dino ride, madagascar ride, all alright not too great for an adult but a kid will love it.My tip :- Plan early, as early as possible may be first one to enter the gates. So you don't have to wait for hours in the queue during weekends (or 30-45 min during weekdays). If you want the best and don't mind paying some extra bucks, then go for universal express tickets, they are bit expensive then normal ones but gives you express/direct access/privilege to enjoy the ride without waiting too much. This ticket has separate queue, you get priority over 100's of normal ticket holder waiting in the queue. Do spend in this one, as it will make you enjoy more rides.

review_318815947,“Wow! The best theme park!”,"My children and I thoroughly enjoyed this theme park.We booked online at home before departing for Singapore but found it to be cheaper and easier once arrived.Our package included transfers to the park and day tickets. We received food and retail vouchers to use on the day which was quite extravagant :)My cherubs simply LOVED this theme park! The rides catered for their ages perfectly (9-13 years). They were able to board the most terrfiying rides due to meeting the height requirements.The day was glorious, but became more humid and tiring in the later afternoon. As we arrived at opening, 10am, we could board the rides with little to no queuing. :)The rides offer photos of your experience. Average price is $35 SGD. There are numerous food courts offering international cuisine. Prices start from $8- $70- SGD.There are gift shops in every land of Universal Studios. My cherubs loved the gift shop in Far far away land and Sci Fi land.Sentosa is beautiful! Once departing the thrme park, you can eat, shop, play and more...... an unbelievable place.A taxi will cost approx. $12 SGD to city centre hotels.

review_318655894,“Great place to visit”,"We went there with 2 adults and 2 children (aged 4 & 10). The 4 year old was just too short to go on a lot of rides which was disappointing as the 10 year old was tall enough but too scared. We ended up after 1 ride getting a fast pass - there are 2 you can get - one for each ride once and the other for unlimited. We got it for all four of us for one ride each. That saved us hours. There was no checking of our bags so we could bring in what ever food and drink we liked. Doesnt have the same atmosphere as LA and is much smaller than LA but still very enjoyable. We could hire a pram which was good and you can even get a double pram or motorized scooter for a reasonable price. We caught public transport from our hotel to Sentosa board walk and walked across. It was only about a 20 minute walk and really scenic.

review_317735344,“Bringing the Kid Out Time and Again!”,"This was not our first visit to Universal Studios, Singapore but the said attraction still never fails to amaze us.We went there on September 2015, and thank God, the heaven's blessed us with another haze-free day. It seems that Singapore has been experiencing for the past three years these pollutants coming from Indonesia. Haze somehow will spoil the fun in most attractions.Anyway, we booked our tickets on-line thru Resorts World Sentosa website. It would save you from queuing and sometimes, there are discounts on-line. We got our tickets at S$64.00 compared to S$72.00 on-site. We considered taking the express pass, but decided against it. Thank heavens, because of the haze situation in Singapore, the park was not overcrowded with tourists. Our queue for each ride was less than 10min. We went to the Transformers first, then the Battlestar Galactica Roller Coaster, the Jurassic River Ride, had lunch, watched Waterworld, proceeded to Far Far Away, watched 3-D Shrek, rode Puss n Boots Canopy Flyer, went to Madagascar and had a blast. Don't forget to watch the show at the Lights, Camera, Action.If you are travelling with a smaller kid, he or she must meet the height requirement of 3.9 foot in some rides. We took a lot of pictures as memorabilia. The kids got crazy with the Press-A-Penny machines were you drop a few coins to make your own souvenir. There are also lockers, food stalls and restos. You can store your things at various lockers for a fee. At the Ancient Egypt, you can even store your things for free as long as you do not exceed the maximum time allotted for free storage. If you get wet, there are also dry docks for S$5.00 or you can buy a shirt to change into forming part of your souvenir. The restrooms are also well maintained by the way.We went there as early as 9:30 in the morning and got out at around 4:00 in the afternoon in order to catch the Wings of Time Show at Beachpoint, Sentosa.Universal Studios always brings out the kid in us, no matter how old we are.

review_317724965,“This has all happened before...it will all happen again in Universal Studios Singapore”,"There's something really thrilling about riding roller coasters. And while you're doing so, why not ride one themed with Battle Star Galactica. Maybe even two?One of Universal Studios Singapore's most interesting rides is just that: Two BSG themed roller coasters, one for ""Humans"" and one for ""Cylons"". If you don't know what these are, don't fret. You can still enjoy the rides anyway. These two rides offer two completely different ways of riding roller coasters, but I'd rather not spoil what they are. It's better you find out for yourself.Having come here on a September, we didn't have to take too long in lines. So if you're coming here on a non-peak season as well, don't bother with the Express ticket. The most you'll have to wait is maybe an hour for a ride.There are other interesting rides and attraction in USS as well, which you're sure to enjoy if you take the time to come here. Of course, it's all fun and games until someone cuts in line in front of you to join their group of friends (sadly, this happened to us, and it may just happen to you). Amusement parks like these really need to take that into consideration as well in their queues.If you're looking for a place to feel the thrill and enjoy, then Universal Studios Singapore is right for you. You might think it's like all other universal studios, but I guess the only thing I can really say to that is: This has all happened before...it will all happen again.

review_317694163,“Must Visit!”,"Always a great experience at Universal Studios Singapore. Must ride the Battlestar Galactica, both the Human and Cylon! Intense but exhilarating. Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure ride is enjoyable but be prepared to get drenched or just purchase a poncho at the vending machine. Mummy ride is worth a try. Would be better with more thrill rides. Enter before noon and grab the park map for navigation. Great for family and friends.

review_317647334,“The 'horrors' of Halloween Horror Nights”,"USS is currently holding their annual Halloween Horror Nights (HHN) event on Fri-Sun till end October. It takes place after hours, from 7pm onwards.If you visit the park during the daytime, you may feel a little shortchanged as the parade has been suspended during this month. The park also closes earlier, at 6pm. Some attractions are closed, and some of the the Halloween props are left out in the open or covered up with cloth or canvas. Yes, it does make for interesting photos but it may detract for your park experience.Halloween isn't really very common in this part of the world, so HHN by USS is a pretty big deal. However, the crowds are merciless and you'd best prepare yourselves for what you'll be up against if you visit HHN5.Firstly, you'll need a separate ticket for this event. This applies to both AP and SP holders as well. The tickets are almost the same price as the daytime ticket, but check their website for various promos and offers. There is an option to upgrade your daytime ticket to a HHN5 ticket (the 'Stay and Scream') which also comes bundled with some perks, like a choice spot to view the opening 'Scaremony' and one single-use Express ticket.Secondly, I would not recommend going without an Express Pass. USS has fiendishly priced EP based on demand, so the earlier you buy, the cheaper they are. On peak nights, they can go up to $90! Without the EP, you could be waiting in line for up to 3 hours for a 10 min walkthrough of the haunted houses, and considering how the park is only open for 6 hours max, well, you may not be able to complete everything. Even with EP, you may be faced with a wait, although the queue moves a lot faster than the regular line.Sundays are the best days to go, since most people have to be at school/work the next day. Currently, the EP is priced at only $50 for Sundays. Avoid Saturdays at all cost. Also, most secondary schools will close by end October, so it may get even more crowded towards the last few days.If you hate to queue, consider the RIP tour. It is really the only way to complete all the haunted houses and scare zones plus some rides in one night without mad game strategy + running, with some time left over for a second do-over if you'd like. RWS Invites members only pay $158 (usual price $198), quite a bargain considering a ticket + EP would set you back at least $100. As part of the RIP tour, you also get a lanyard, a glow stick, express-EXPRESS access (you are brought right to the front of the queue), a 'bloody' drink and an option for a pizza dinner buffet or a $15 meal voucher. PLUS a zombie surgeon as your tour guide. HHN5 has taken a markedly local flavour this year (SG50, lor) and while last year's event felt more polished and professional, this year's HHN5 is more appealing in terms of the scare-factor. 3 of the 4 haunted houses are very local and familiar, and these were the ghosts stories I grew up with, and thus really quite scary.More tips from me:- one of the SCARIEST things at the park is...the price of the drinks. So bring your own waterbottle, and fill up at the many water fountains around the park. They are situated outside the toilets as well as along the queues for the rides.- As an AP, I would recommend giving the rides a miss. I suppose if you bought a ticket + EP specially for this event, and are not likely to return anytime soon, you should definitely try out BSG. The queue for Human is almost always shorter than Cyclon, and equally thrilling.Taking BSG at night isn't really that special, but maybe it's because you can't keep your glasses on during the ride, so I couldn't see anything. - Try to walk a little slower inside the houses. It's natural to want to run through it because ""it's scary"" but bunching kinda ruins the experience. Also, you've just queued for XXX minutes, so take your time, enjoy the little details of the set and prepare to get scared.Many thanks goes out to the staff of USS, the scare-actors, the support staff for making this event possible!

review_317294688,“Park attendant should have more enthusiasm! rides are thrilling...”,"Went several times this year, some of the rides were thrilling (cylon and human). my legs went jelly after that, my teenager absolutely adored it, she went for many rides. I highly recommend buying the express pass, otherwise the wait could be 70 to 90 mins per ride, it becomes boring and tiring. the mummy and the transformer rides were fun too. some of the rides were quite lame though. If you are thinking of going for more than a day, get the season pass for $99/- valid for 6 months, annual pass available too!.There are many restaurants outside the park, you can get out(with a chop on your hand) for re-entry to the park.Please note there are rides that does not allow bags, sun glasses or even mobile phone with you. however, there are locker you can use. They are free up to certain time, depending on the Queue, clear signage to show you how to use. There are attendants nearby to assist too!.btw, if you want to ride on the Jurassic park, you will get wet, they sell disposable raincoat at the vending machines for $4/-, you can buy from watsons or guardian before entering USS for a fraction of the price. Please note that some rides may not operate when raining.Have Fun!

review_317216990,“Limited rides with young kids”,"Our last visit was in Sep 15 where Singapore got hit with the haze from Indonesia. It was not too bad as PSI was still less than 100. However, I would imagine it to be very unhealthy if we are there on days where PSI > 100. My daughter just made it for the rides with height restriction > 92cm so there are 3 additional rides that she can take this visit. However, at 2.5 years old, she found the Enchanted Airway and Spagetti Chase too frightening. We did not manage to take the Canopy Flyer as the waiting time was quite long and it was a long wait for a very short ride. We still ended up taking the Accelerator, Dino Soaring and Party-go-round, over and over again. These are the rides that she could take before she reached 92cm.

It was the best decision. We visited on a weekday, and with the Fast Pass, there was a zero (0) to 5-minute wait for the rides. Actually, there was no wait for most of the rides (Transformers, Cylon (VERY intense and thrilling- prepare to scream for this roller coaster!), Puss in Boots, Jurassic World)... Only the kiddy dinosaur ride required a wait of 5 minutes in the Fast Pass line-up. We also watched one of the Elmo shows and enjoyed walking around the park. We had 3 young children with us, so the Fast Pass really served us well. We were basically on our way home by 3:30pm (arrived around 10am). If we hadn't gotten the Fast Pass, we wouldn't have been able to experience so many of the rides. So yes, the Fast Pass is totally worth it!!!

At my age I thought I was a bit too old to go on the two big roller coasters, heart wouldn't handle it, but I went on the smaller rides. Loved the Lost World water ride, albeit I got soaked, but it was fun.The shows were most entertaining, especially the Shrek, far, far away show. Food is expensive so we had a McDonald's breakfast before entering but had to buy something else late afternoon to get us through. Ride times varied from 10 mins to nearly an hour, but again it was all worth it. We really enjoyed it, had rides, watched shows, ate icecream ... and no kids. LOL.

I purchased the express pass unlimited $70 SGD was well worth it. Early on was getting straight on to rides and later in day was 10-15 min wait.

review_316546602,“A must do for all the family”,"We loved Universal Studios, my kids are 4 and 9 and there are plenty of ride options for both age groups. I suggest you get there for when it opens as it gets busy, we had previously been told that the Transformers ride and the roller coasters have the biggest queues of sometimes up to 2 hours. We did them first before the line up's got too big.The longest we waited for any ride was 40 mins and we did the whole park in 1 day, in fact we walked around it twice. Late on in the day, we got on the Transformers ride again as there was surprisingly only a 5 min wait time. The characters that walk around are great, the dancing Bumblee Transformer was excellent as was the animatronics Jurassic World Raptor. There are plenty of toilets and places to eat, though they are the usual expensive theme park prices. My only negative was there was very little seating areas in the shade and the weather was so hot and humid. My little one had his 1st mini roller coaster experience and loved it, 5 times later, we managed to move to another area! My oldest loved the Jurassic World area and the water Rapids ride, a couple of drenchings later we were all soaked! It was a great day out for all the family, I would highly recommend.

The rides have very long queues, even the front of line passes. I will say if you have been to the Hollywood Universal then it is very similar, although not as good. And you can easily see the whole thing in a few hours. I also have to say that we wouldn't have minded doing the Halloween special area, but it was an extra $50 or something. That is way overpriced. Ticket price should cover this. We were in Disneyland for Xmas and there was no extra charge for all of the extras they had on.

review_316439865,“Amazing!”,"It was my first time visiting Singapore, and the purpose of coming here is to go to Universal Studio. I was super excited about going there. There were tons of ride! I recommend the Battlestar Galactica, the Battlestar Galactica is the roller coaster with blue and red track, the blue one is more challenging, and the red one is a normal simple ride but it’s also fun. I would also recommend the water show called Waterworld, it is very fun to watch and the actress is also very funny and friendly. Waterworld show could help you feel better from the hotness. Or Lost World is one of the place that people wanted to go in Universal Studio because everything looks fun and everybody love Jurassic Park! But you want to go there I recommend bringing your own raincoat because if you want to play the water ride, you have to pay a lot of money for just 1 raincoat. Now the staff, the staff is very friendly (for some), but the staff is usually nice, so don’t worry about it. One last thing, if you hate waiting in line get the express pass, it’s kinda expensive but it’s really worth it.

I am 48 and my 14 and 17 year old daughters talked me into quite a few rides. I went on the Puss & Boots Ride, Enchanted Airways Shrek Ride, went to Shrek in 4D which was great. You wear 3D glasses but the seats moved, sprayed water & air at you, it really felt like you were there. I also went on Revenge of the Mummy (loved it). Then my youngest talked me into going on the blue roller coaster ride (screamed all the way). Great ride but leave your shoes behind as legs hang loose and may lose the shoes. Then I went on the Transformers Ride. Awesome (another 3D/4D ride) but I had to close my eyes when it went too fast as I just had a flavoured juice.

It was a bit pricey but who cares since it coud be one of your best memories in your whole life. I really had a fantastic time in USS and I will surely go back there if given the second chance. :)

review_316261173,“It was OK.”,"The only gripe I have with it was the amount of time you had to wait in line for some of the rides, around 50 minutes was to long to line up in the heat. When we did finally get to go on two rides (as the waiting time was less than 10 minutes) were great. More signage around the park would be great as we tended to walk around in circles. Very expensive but very clean.

The queue's each only takes 5-15minutes. And after that we went for the transformer and mummys, yes it takes more than 45minutes in line, not worth the wait. but the most disappointed ride perhaps the treasure hunter, we are in q for 1 hour for 4 minutes ride of almost nothing.For lunch we have the Goldilocks which is a halal restaurant. Good food with fair price.The haze however affect our visit, we didn't get to see the famous waterworld show..sigh.overall, it was an enjoyable visit.

review_316157331,“A Fun-Filled Place For Children Of All Ages!”,"A great experience for the family if you're ever in Singapore. The park is huge so prepare a nice walking shoes cause you'll do a lot of walking from one ride to another. Located at Sentosa Island which you can get to via a cable car from Harbour Front Tower II or via a monorail located at Vivo City. On a busy day be prepared to queue from 60 to 90 minutes so I suggest buy the Universal Express ticket which acts like a VIP card so you don't have to queue anymore and save time in the process. There's a ride where you can get wet, the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure, so a change of clothes will be handy, although there's a vending machine that sells a poncho but your shoes can still get wet. There are also souvenir shops at almost every exit of each of the rides.

review_315948972,“Something completely different”,"I'd heard so much about UNIVERSAL STUDIOS at Sentosa, S/pore. Possibly too much because when I got there it seemed to be too much like a poor mans Disneyland.Yes it was good, yes it was easy to navigate and yes there was heaps to see BUT very little of it related to the STUDIOS part of Universal. It seemed to concentrate more on the movies the Studio had released with shops, shops and more shops trying to compete with one another for your disposable $. All relating to a token Movie. There were some interesting rides but not a great deal unless you are into the big-dipper type. Some characters at intermittent times came out to be viewed from a distance, ie Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin and a couple of others. Then some cartoon type characters viz Minions etc and probably the best of all would have to have been the 2 Transformers interacting with the Public - they were superb. Of all the exhibition type thingys the best in my opinion was the young lady dressed as ""Cleopatra""(?). She was a scene/show stealer. Her expression was flawless and faultless. In my opinion she was an asset to the Studios.This experience is not cheap so bring your wallet, you're gonna need it!! However a very big plus is that they do give Seniors Discounts to ALL Seniors with proof of age.

But 4 stars for 2 reasons; (1) the Battlestar Galactica roller coaster wasn't working. This is the 2nd time that this has happened when I've been there. And from what others tell me, it's a regular occurrence. (2) The Jurassic Park ride was very enjoyable except that lots of us got drenched and there are no facilities to dry your clothes. Universal Studios need to put in place a drying room for people to dry off. Perhaps provide a coverall paper suit to wear while your clothes are in the dryer. One young local man had his iphone ruined. I had to go back to the hotel to change. But that aside I highly recommend a visit.

review_315862513,“Halloween! Interesting but lacking Scare Factor”,"We purchase the tickets using with a discounted value of SGD 50 without the express pass for the Halloween Horror Night Event .We knew we were going to be in for the long night without the express pass and having to queue for hours for a single attraction.And it showed.Gates Open at 7pm and we were all hurdled into the entrance, where loud music and strobe lights of different colors were flashing about. There were some acrobatic acts at the start with an introduction to the Halloween Event which was Blood Moon. Then the whole crowd started rushing forward. Halloween Horror Houses showcase a unique event which was Singapore and the Asian Horror Stories like the Ghost Train which features a realistic recreation of the Singapore subway. Others like the Housing Blocks in Singapore are also on display, where possessed residents are out to scare you. And also Hell House is which you enter the netherworld where Chinese ghosts are waiting for you. Lastly tunnel people in which you descend to the depths of the USS and meet with the demons who live there.This is sort of different from the past Halloween Horror Nights. Because what you are experiencing is Singapore's Ghost events and Culture. Though the ""mazes"" are interesting with a good amount of realistic props, creatures, background story it lacks the scare factor of Halloween Fright Nights. To be honest, if you are looking to get scared, frighten, terrified, don't bother with this. But if you are willing to get immersed with the local culture, see something different. Then it's a good deal.Be Prepared to queue for 1- 2 hours for the houses if you do not have express pass in hot and humid conditions. Though there are stores along the lines which sells overpriced drinks. However the good thing about Halloween Horror Night is that if you go during this event, it is much cheaper than the Original USS Price, and you get to ride most of the Major Rides like Battlestar Galatica, Transformers, Puss In Boots and many more. Furthermore, you still get to experience the Universal Halloween Event!It's a 2 for the price of 1! Get the express pass so you don't have to wait. You might complete everything in just 5 hours!

I can't stress enough the value of the Universal Express ticket. For an extra S$30, you can avoid the extensive queues for your favourite rides, and in many instances head straight to the front. With a Universal Express ticket, you will easily get through the resort in a day, without, you'll have to skip quite a lot.

review_315652308,“Thoroughly entertaining time!!!”,"First up a disclaimer - I have not been to any other Universal Studios so pls don't consider this review as a benchmark for evaluating the Singapore studios to the ones situated in other parts of the globe.We were three families - 6 adults, kid about 7 years and two infants (2 and a half years both of them). We took two cabs from our hotel to Universal studios directly.The studios are open from 10 am to 7 pm. So in order to make the most of the visit, we reached there by 10.15 am. We had booked tickets online and that helped us beat the queues. Would recommend getting tickets online. We had purchased the sentosa 2 day fun package which gave access to 20 rides in Sentosa on a day and one day in Universal (more details available in Sentosa Island site).You can access all the rides in the studios with the entry ticket and have to say we had a ball of a time. The studios are organized in separate themes. All the information is available in a map of the studios at the entrance. The map details the location and the kind of activity at each place.The ride I enjoyed the most was the roller coaster in the Sci fi themed section. There are two big roller coasters in this section, Human(red) and Cyclon (blue). I rode the red line and it was awesome. The waiting time was one hour at each and I went only on the red one. Hindsight, should've gone on the blue one too (sniff, sniff...). If you are the adventurous kind should go for at least one of these as none of the other rides come close to this.We also enjoyed all the other rides, especially the transformed themed ride. Will not add more details and spoil the fun. A fun filled place for both adults and kids. Go ahead and experience the fun friends!!!!Note for Indian food seekers - my friend said the Oasis in the Egyptian theme section serves Indian food both veg and non-veg. Although I had a nice beer and a hotdog sandwich next to the Oasis (hehehe)

Found staff to be unknowledgable (girl selling tickets for cable car couldn't tell me much about pricing if paying on the island). Most staff were quite miserable too. For the rip off entry fee of $74 each they could at least pretend to be happy.Enjoyed transformer ride but it was short and Lost world ride was broken (I believe this happens frequently)My friend thought there weren't many choices for rides and shows and a lot of them were really old themes (Waterworld, Jurassic Park, Shrek are all really very '5 minutes ago') Singapore's park comes a very shabby second to those in the US where things run smoothly, staff at least pretend to enjoy their jobs and queues are organised.Food and drinks are very expensive - you pay way over the regular price on Sentosa that you pay on Singapore Island.Quality of food was awful - my friend's son thought he was getting nachos but instead he got a bag of chips with some unidentifiable bright orange sauce that was supposed to be cheese.I don't eat meat, dairy or eggs so there was literally nothing there suitable except overpriced, yuk looking fruit. It's best to bring your own food and keep it in one of the overpriced lockers. It would still be cheaper than buying food and probably safer.I can safely say I will never visit this awful place again. I'll wait til I next visit the States where customer service (abysmally bad in Singapore in general), organisation and choice of experiences is vastly superior.

We prepurchased tickets at the airport - this saves about 5 dollars per ticket, and went in to the first ride and waited in line. That took over an hour!!! So we decided to buy an additional skip the line ticket - this cost another 30 each.

We brought our own water, a large packet of chips and some frozen fruit boxes to cut down the cost while we were there. If u show the Sentosa Harbour Front Precinct Guide and Map (from info centre on Orchard Rd) when purchasing the tickets u get 10% off of the adult entry price. We were there 10am to 6pm and left tired and satisfied. Best rides - transformer, the blue roller coaster, the mummy, shriek 4D. If u are prepared to go as single riders which we did, it can. Cut down wait time considerably on the rides that offer it. The wait time indicated at the beginning of the rides on the boards are not always accurate. Our longest wait was about an hour for Transformer early in the day. The kids went on it as single riders after 4 and had no wait time. The monorail from beachfront station is free. Toilets are everywhere and clean. My family really enjoyed the day out and the park was the perfect size for a days outings if u go on the rides. Plenty more to do if your kids are less adventurous!

The whole place is just so magical and fun!! And you have to try the. Pizza place in NY NY. It's like REAL NY PIZZA!!!

review_315230354,“Fantastic family day out! ”,"Fantastic family day out at Universal Studios. Bought tickets online at home and printed them out for easy entry. Also invested in Universal Express Unlimited passes - allows you to bypass the crowds on a special queue (no limit on the number of times you can use it) - highly recommended to cram in as many rides as you can on a day visit. Purchase in advance is recommend as the may sell out for that day.Tried all the rides. Everyone enjoyed Sesame St Space Spaghetti Space Chase which was very cute. Family favourite for all was Transformers 3D Battle and Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure (you will get a bit wet on that one though). Thrill seekers love Battlestar Galactica (Human/Red and Cylon/Blue) and The Mummy. For those who don't like roller coasters, the Lost World Canopy Flyer and Puss in Boots Roller Coaster were a good compromise to do with the family so they don't hassle you to go on the full on roller coaster. Lunch at Mel's Dinette was clean, efficient and reasonably priced. After 7 hours at Universal it was money well spent for some very happy (and exhausted) family members.

review_315118729,“Awesome!!!”,"Definitely worth the money. I had an excellent time. I booked a transfer to USS off viator, made for an easy transition. However, it is easily accessible via the train. The train terminates at the mall, and from there you take the Sentosa Express. Park is the first stop on the Sentosa Express.I got a $5 off a meal with my ticket. I ate at Oasis in Ancient Egypt. Delicious food, would love to eat there again. Rides are amazing, I went on Jurrassic Park and Revenge of the Mummy multiple times. Both rides have a solo riders line which is convenient if you are alone. Would love to go there again.

review_315081399,"“Great theme park, cost adds up though”","It's worth paying the extra $30 or $50 on top of the entry price of $74 for the express queue option. You can buy this inside the park if you want to see what the queues are like first. We went off peak (after the Singapore school holidays finished) - sept 29. In the morning 10-11.30 the queues were only up to 20mins, but 11.30 - 3.30 they peaked to 60-70mins - that's when we bought the express ticket. It made a huge difference to our waiting times 0-10mins. After that the queues were again back down, to 5-15 mins. As to be expected food is not cheap and items from the souvenir shops really add up. All in all though it was definitely worth the visit. My family really enjoyed themselves.

It's too crowded and hot, great experience though. Also the first time I dare to ride something extreme like the Puss in Boots attraction and then there's another one called Transformer. woah, never thought a scaredy cat like me will ride all of those things, but of course I will surely never ride the most extreme ones (you know which one).

review_315000047,“Exciting - Get your adrenaline rushing.”,"It is a Wow full day experience. We had a lot of fun in the park and we tried to cover each and every activity or ride that was available. There are ample food joints where you can pick up water, soda, wafers and other tit bits to eat so do not load yourself unnecessarily. There is a food court also.It is important that you take an express pass if you can. The waiting time at rides and other attractions, specially the popular roller coasters was upto 2 hours when we visited. Thankfully we had express passes and we could just zoom through the waiting queues. Every ride/attraction is more thrilling/beautiful than the other and you must try to see as much as you can. It was my first visit to any Universal Studio. Every ride is based on a theme and characters from movies and one thing that I really liked was that from every ride you will exit through a grand shop where you can pick up gifts and souvenirs following the same theme or characters on which the ride was based. However, I must also mention that the stuff they were selling was very highly priced and we did not buy much.

The queues were at times 2.5 hrs long, and the express queue wasn't much better. I was told later that it was holidays in the area and this would explain the large numbers of people. But having said this, it is still disappointing to spend a fair amount of money and not be able to get value for money. The water world show was great, but had a production problem half way through and was stopped for about ten minutes, and then most people stood up and left, as they didn't want to miss out on trying to get on a ride. Such a shame that people had to do this in order to get a ride.

Whilst express tickets are available for purchase an additional cost to entry of $50 - $74 after a $78 entry fee was not warranted. However, if you value your time whilst in the park to maximise your experience then there really isn't a choice. A lot of the waiting areas were not air conditioned or even provided fans so it was almost a 90 minute sauna session. The 4D shrek adventure was worth the 15 minutes of waiting time.

review_314542334,“Never too old!”,"We were only in Singapore for 3 days ""passing through"" on our way from Sri Lanka to Indonesia and Universal Studios was pretty much the only activity we had planned in advance and it was such a great day!The MRT system is so reliable and relatively cheap so we were able to get there in time for the gates opening and avoid any huge queues (which pretty much goes for the entire day - we went on a Friday, I'm sure it would have been a different story at the weekend!). The day got off to an especially good start when my 23 year old boyfriend won the award for ""most excited guest"" (breaking children's hearts left, right and centre I should imagine) meaning we got 5 ""front of the line passes"" which came in very handy! I'm not sure if they run this little competition every day, but if they do, it's definitely worth throwing your dignity aside as the passes are 100% worth it!If you've ever been to Universal Studios California, this one is just as good; the rides are awesome and the park itself is stunning to walk around. The only thing Singapore doesn't have the California does is a movie studio tour. I couldn't point out a dull moment but my favourite ride by far was the Transformers 3D ride....absolutely incredible!! I'd been on it before in the US a couple of years ago and was praying it was going to be just as good here and I wasn't disappointed.

review_314525880,“Disappointing.”,"We were excited to visit & had previously only been to Universal in Los Angeles. Well, there's just NO comparison! Universal Singapore was small, had limited rides suited to teenagers & we ended up leaving after just 3 hours. That was plenty of time to do everything on offer, though as we were very fortunate to visit on a day when lines were minimal. My 14 year old did love the Revenge of the Mummy ride, which she did several times.We had a very nice lunch at the Oasis Spiced Cafe, where the air conditioning was a blessing & we easily found a table. The food was tasty & also reasonably priced.Even though we lived in Australia for many years, we really found the heat & humidity in Singapore oppressive and exhausting. For me, it's just not the ideal place to do an outdoor theme park unless you're really used to being outdoors in such heat & humidity combined.Would W&D visit there again? No. We'll definitely be leaving our Universal visits for when we're in LA due to the heat and the limited ride options in Singapore.

review_314435949,“Relatively small theme park that is fun depending on weather conditions”,"This is our second visit to this park, the last being 3-4 years ago. The crowd was definitely fewer but the quality of the rides and shows have somewhat dropped. However, I would not say that the park itself was poorly maintained, it is just that it is not well managed and I see no improvements (if at all there are now fewer attractions) since we last visited the place that will call for second time visitors to visit this park. During the time when we were there, there were fewer street shows and lesser chances of meeting any movie characters. But then again there was once we came across to what appeared to be an Asian like ""Marilyn Monroe"", which may not be exactly what you are looking for. This adds a negative point to the already relatively fewer attractions you would find in this park compared to others for the same price owing to the relatively small size of the park. Since the park is very dependent on weather conditions, it may be the case that you may have made plans many months ago and bought your ticket with hopes of having a good time. But then, at the first sign of clouds with not even a drop of rain, the park will close all its outdoor rides. it may be for safety reasons but this means that about 75% of all the attractions are no longer accesible. So, now you are stuck with just a few places to visit. Since the park is not so big either, your best bet would be going to the restaurants and shops which, in my opinion, is much costlier than Universal Studios in Los Angeles (of which I have visited twice as well). The management does not offer you a return pass due to bad weather which also suggests that for a park located in tropical wet weather country, it is very likely that you will have to face this condition again in your next visit. The visitors must be very aware that they are dependent on luck to either enjoy a good time with the family or have a very wet experience. When they visit this park with this in mind, perhaps the expectations would not be so high and therefore visitors are more willing to accept the short comings of the park. Since there was no chance of getting on some of the rides, one could consider coming back during the dry season. Maybe this is not so good a good idea as well.... as Singapore experiences very bad haze during this time, most likely due to the smog coming from neighboring Indonesia.So, as a whole what would you expect having visit this park? Expect to pay fairly high premium prices for a clean, not so crowded park and with a chance that many rides will not be available to you. Comparatively to other parks worldwide, expect to pay a lot more for the food and the goodies etc. The good side of this park is that it is located in Singapore, a safe place and well regulated. A small island that allows you to stay elsewhere conveniently at affordable rates, without having to depend on the nearby hotels which will cost you a bomb! There are also halal outlets which is a major plus point and the food is probably a lot tastier given its Asian cooking. As such visitors can expect to not get overloaded with sodas and deep-fried stuff you may find in many other parks elsewhere.

But now, I think it is just ok as compared to price they charge for it. Except for few rides say transformer, roller coaster and mummy rides, rest all are average. They have something like 19 rides and more than half of them are meant only for kids (and really kids only). So this leaves very few for adults. If u r coming from India, then I must say Imagica is better option. It has better rides than USS (except roller coaster which is better in USS) and quite appropriately priced.People with kids, one good thing in USS is that they have water points almost everywhere.

I was lucky that the Battlestar Galactica ride was open (after it got closed for almost 2 years, according to my friends). My favourite ride was Revenge of The Mummy at Ancient Egypt. I've read rumours of how good Transformers-Ride was but, I prefer the Mummy. There are 2-3 rides saying you will be wet or possibly soaked, fret not. It was just a drizzle of water. You don't have to put your bag inside the paid-lockers (for wet rides) because the sun will help you dry up in a seconds. Unlike USJ, visitors aren't allowed to bring in food and drinks. But you can bring empty bottles and refill it in the park. The park opens at 10am and close at 6pm. Pretty short eh?

review_313904877,“Do not visit with young teenagers”,"Universal Studios promises a lot, but is terribly disappointing in reality. There are too few rides suited to young teenagers and above; thus the queues are horrendous. We visited on a quietish day and all of the main rides suited to teenagers (Transformers, Galactica, The Mummy) had minimum 60 minute waits. Oh, and when the sign says 60 minutes - try 90. It is quite clear that Universal are sweating this asset for all its worth. They get as many people through the door as possible and then make you wait and wait and wait to access the rides. In a six hour visit - we managed three rides on the showpiece attractions. Awful.They should either build more rides of significance or limit the number of people entering the park. Do not bother with Universal Studios Singapore unless you're happy to queue for hours - and I mean that literally.

review_313897597,“The endless queuing experience”,"After being the whole day in the park (10:00-19:00), with only 30 minutes break for lunch we were only able to try:- Sesame Street Spaghetti- Accelerator- Transformers: the ride- Battlestar Galactica: Cyclon- Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure- Shrek 4-D AdventureWhy? Because of the endless queues!Suggestion for future visitors: Get the express option. It will save you around 1 hour per attraction.In general, I think this park is extremely expensive and too crowded, therefore, I don't recommend it!For USS people, maybe if you limit the amount of people that can get into the park most users will be happy.Another solution may be to implement some kind of booking for the high demand rides so people will approach to the rides within a defined time window. That way you don't waste your time in the queues.

review_313869474,“Good Day Out ”,"We had a day at Universal Studios in September 2015 as a birthday celebration for one of my kids. It was a really enjoyable day. While we didn't go on all the rides - some were just too big and scary for a young child - there were plenty of other things to do to keep everyone entertained. Shrek 4D was pretty good fun, the Elmo ride was enjoyable and so was the Puss in Boots roller coaster. Everyone had a good time and the birthday celebration was a success.

review_313674760,“Great day out”,"Visited USS with two children aged 11 and 6. Had a great day and managed to experience most rides and attractions. We pre-purchased our tickets through a travel agent which saved us about 20% and also gave us meal and retail vouchers. Although we went on a school day we deliberately arrived 30 minutes early to queue and didn't bother with the express ticket. For the first couple of hours, wait times were mostly less than 10 minutes so we were able to access the popular rides before the crowds came. After lunch the wait times blew out to over 60 minutes for the most popular rides. The most exciting rides were the Transformers ride, both roller coasters and the Lost City ride. Our younger daughter enjoyed Puss in Boots and the Madagascar boat ride. The attractions are very well finished and the park is well organised. As with most theme parks, food and merchandise are pricey. Our USS visit was the highlight of our short stay in Singapore and is somewhere we would return.weremostly

Initially wanted to go to buy online from USS but found out from my friends that they managed to much better deals such as cheaper than online discount and has offer free transfer from their hotel to Sentosa. It makes a lot of differences in dollars , almost 20-30% cheaper than retail and offer much more. Like free gift and free shopping Voucher. This travel company is very well known in Hong Kong, Taiwan , China . They are Travel Delight Singapore. Very interesting is that they offer more than prices.. It services that really makes the difference. Free Pick up in hotel to USS and also they send the tickets to hotel reception (although at a small fees) which is negligent. Travel Delight also sell many attraction tickets at a good deal which makes the smart tourist delightful. Guess if you want, you just twist a thought in this and you know where to locate them. Cool right ?

No matter what you do, please get the Universal Express Pass, it's expensive but so worth it! My friends and I took our time exploring the park while others were running around trying to hit all the popular rides to beat the queue. The Express also has it's perks at certain shows, letting us in first even though we joined the queue pretty late. Pretty good investment to make the experience at USS an incredible one.

review_312866429,“Family fun day”,"Family trip to Singapore included a day at Universal Studios. Took the SMRT from Orchard to Harbour Front then switched to the Sentosa train. You can also walk across the covered bridge. Once there we took the obligatory picture in front of the rotating globe and lined up for tickets. Get to park park earlier in the day if you can. We got there at 11:00AM and there was quite a crowd already. We purchased the express pass and it was worth the extra fee. The first ride we went on had a 5 minute wait for express line and a 1 hour wait for regular line. Food places were expensive and crowded which I believe is normal for any theme park. The Battlestar Galatica ride was awesome with two separate coasters - Human and Cylon. It is probably best to start with Human side first as it is not so rough. The Cylon ride is undoubtedly harsher and throws you around plus it is inverted so your feet hang down. All in all, it was a great family day.

review_311244146,“Service reduction from year to year”,"This is my 3rd visit to Universal Studio Singapore, and it become disappointing from year to year. The good things are, new ride are introduced every year make an additional choice to try the new things when you revisit the park. Things that I dont like in the last visit:1. They close the park at 6PM. A year ago, the park is closed at 8PM and there is a firework at the closing time during weekend. Now, they divide the opening time into 2-stages. The daytime visitor and evening visitor for private event. After 6PM, we are not allowed to take a ride anymore and we are pushed to leave the park. The evening visitor crowd start to come at 5PM, so if you expect the park become less crowded during the evening, you make a big mistake.2. No more parade. Year ago, there was still a parade during the weekend.3. No more fireworks.The gesture from the ground staff also not good after 6PM. I still have kids queueing for Galactica. He start to queue before 6PM but probably still stuck inside due to long queue. I am waiting for him and they ask me to leave the park. My kids do not have any cellphone and we are foreigner in Singapore. They do not allow me to check to the queue, and do not want to give paging to check whether my kids is still in the queue or not. They dont care if my kids get lost. They just ask me to wait outside. Fortunately, my kids finally emerge from the attraction and we can gather again together. Anyway, the attraction is still attractive and I still consider to come again in the next coming years, since this is still considered as the better choice in the region.

review_311180632,“Good place for Adventure”,"There is easy connectivity to Sentosa from the city through MRT and buses. Going to universal studios is a full day trip especially if you love adventure rides. There is so much happening around in the place all day that you will get tired easily. The water show is amazing, don't miss it! The rides are good. The red and blue roller coaster ride will make you shout your lungs out. There is a cartoon character parade but that is only on Friday and Saturday in the evening. If you are a chocolate lover, the Hershey's store at the entrance of Universal studios will make you go crazy. During peak rush time, there is a waiting of around 65mins for every ride, which is an unnecessary time waste. If you happen to visit on such a crowded day and want to take all the rides, a priority pass can be purchased for an additional fees of SP $50. This will save you from standing in long queues.

Ticket is expensive and waiting time is tooooooo much on rides with normal ticket. Go for express tickets if rides need to be enjoyed. Small place but loaded with activities.

review_310990693,“Great day out! ”,"We read other reviews and so avoided going on Sunday. We went on Monday and although it seemed busy the queues weren't too Bad. The longest we waited was an hour (red roller coaster) The water rapid queue said 30 minute wait but it wasn't even that. As people were leaving around 5pm there were no queues for any rides apart from the two roller coasters so we got a few rides in quick. The transformers ride is brilliant, the others seem to be over before they've even begun. Good entertainment for children. I don't know how much it was for express tickets, although I didn't mind a few half hour queues I would recommend these if possible to make the most of the day, especially if it's busy.

review_310961960,“amazing fun-filled day”,"what can I say - both adults & kids enjoyed the day thoroughly! had to be there earlier than the opening hours to buy tickets, and queue up for entry into the park. the adults loved the transformer and flying canopy ride. the kids were totally in love with the jurassic park water ride - it may seem ""boring"" to some, but the kids were excited to see dinosaurs along the ride & were dying to be in best position to get wet!!! we repeated this ride. the mummy ride & rollercoaster rides on the battlestar are not for the faint-hearted. yes, the lines were long at some attractions, but one can simply go to another attraction and return again to check-out the lines. compared to the lines at osaksa, the lines here were much more manageable. we found that the lines were not too long towards the closing hours (probably because the big tour groups had left by then). we managed to complete all the rides, but didn't get to watch the waterwold show. (the show was cancelled due to the hazy conditions.)

review_310875297,“Good if you are a kid with huge patience!!”,"the place was heavily crowded and most of the attractions has 45-60 minutes waiting time. the universal express was damn costly. the restaurants were overpriced and few of them served cold and seemingly stale food. the cracker show at 8:00 pm however was a highlight for otherwise a tiring day!!if you plan to visit, be at the gates when it opens as the queues would be lesser.

review_310865767,“Small”,"In comparison to Florida this is a very small park and with a fast pass can be done in a manner of hours. Some of the staff need to learn the meaning of customer service as some were quite rude. Would probably suit younger smaller children.

review_310844225,“Fun & Excited here!”,"This is my 2nd time in USS. You can enjoy with many playthings. My favorite is ""Transformer 3D ride"". Very fun and you can feel that you are sitting on ""Bumblebee"". 1 day is enough for me and my friends. There is parade of all charactor around 5pm or 5.30pm and it's nice.

review_310826366,“Have fun with friends”,"USS was one of funniest destinatinations i experienced in Singapore. Ideally you should go with your friends. There are many interesting place. Only one thing to complain, it was one of busiest place so you'd better go early in the more ning. For each games in the studio, you have to queue for long time, so make sure you bring water and snacks. Luckily, my singaporean friends bought vouchers for us so it just took 50sing dollars for every games and lunch.

review_310802151,“Just great”,"As a huge lover of theme parks, I would have adored this place whether it was a five star experience or not, but it totally was!The park opened at 10am, we arrived pretty early thanks to speedy transport. The monorail was great, we wanted to do the cable car but we heard it was much more expensive. Puss In Boots turned up just before the park opened and high-fived the crowd! A nice touch. The staff also gave a kid one of those express passes (competition for who could scream the loudest).So glad we didn't buy one of those as the longest queue was only 30 minutes for the Jurassic Park Rapids- this is definitely the most popular ride so do this one as early as you possibly can! We hit the big rollercoaster first and queued less than 5 minutes for both tracks. Even my boyfriend who isn't keen on rides had a great day. There is something for everyone here. I got a photo with the minions! The Mummy ride and the Transformers Simulator are excellent.Couple of suggestions- when the ride is deserted the staff should let you ride again without having to go all the way around again- this wouldn't harm anybody and would be great customer service. Also, everything (shops, etc) should still be open even in low season. We have all paid the same price and shouldn't have to miss out on anything during this once in a lifetime experience! I've done Universal before in the U.S. - but how many times will I get to Singapore?! Who knows. We didn't stay until closing time as we managed to do everything by 3pm- but there should be a closing show- fireworks? Something?Also- we get that theme parks are expensive but $20 dollars for the cheapest photo is absolutely extortionate! Just take your own.Tip: my bag wasn't searched- I don't think this is encouraged but bring your own snacks! Obviously theme park food prices are pretty steep- but how awesome that the adults can buy beer?!I think Far Far Away Land was my favourite. I love Shrek (well the 1st movie at least) and there's the huge castle here. The 4D show is alright but takes a long time to actually get into the auditorium...definitely only a one time ride. The Puss In Boots ride is great! The smaller rollercoaster here is good too.We loved the Flyer ride in Jurassic Park- so much fun- forwards and backwards!Was a bit of a pain having outdoor rides closed for a bit but obviously the park cannot control the weather. It was very rainy and hazy yesterday!Loved all the Sesame Street stuff. The show was cute and only 15 minutes.A great day for kids and big kids!
